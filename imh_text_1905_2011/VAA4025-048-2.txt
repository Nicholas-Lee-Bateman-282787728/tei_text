            Thurlow Weed's Network: Whig Party Organization in 1840
            
                    Robert G. Gunderson*
               
                
            On the evening of November 24, 1839, Thurlow Weed left his editorial sanctum at the 
                        Albany
                    
                    Evening Journal and set out for the Democratic Whig National Convention in
                    Harris-burg. His early departure was in response to an urgent appeal from one of his henchmen who
                    reported, "The 
                        Clay
                     and Harrison men are at loggerheads, and by a judicious course [they] may be united
                    upon Genl [Winfield] Scott."1 Stopping over at the Astor House in 
                        New York
                     en route, Weed intercepted several New 
                        England
                     delegates eager to co-operate in his machinations against Henry Clay. "Thurlow
                    is going to make a desperate push to induce 
                        Clay
                     to stand aside," Horace Greeley reported confidentially. "He and the
                    other 'Scott conspirators' entertain little doubt that the nomination of S
                    will be carried."2
            
            Weed's opposition to the Mill Boy's candidacy was prompted largely by political
                    expediency. To Weed, politics was the science of the possible and availability was his basic axiom.
                    In choosing his presidential favorite, he hoped to please a diverse and conglomerate army of
                    abolitionists, anti-Masons, and National Republicans in western 
                        New York
                    ; bankers, merchants, and manufacturers in 
                        New York
                     City; and opportunistic state officials in 
                        Albany
                    . Millard Fillmore accurately reflected Weed's troubles, as well as those of
                    the Whig party, when he asked: "Into what crucible can we throw this heterogeneous mass
                    … so as to melt them down into one mass of

                            College, Oberlin, 
                                Ohio
                            . This paper was read at the session on "Party Politics,
                            1830–1840," at the forty-fifth annual meeting of the

                     pure Whigs of undoubted good mettle?"3 It was evident to Weed that this process of amalgamation required the rejection of 
                        Clay
                     and the acceptance of a noncommittal military hero. As one of his advisers put it:
                    "The General's lips must be hermetically sealed, and our shouts and hurras must
                    be long and loud."4
            
            Though Weed failed at 
                        Harrisburg
                     in his promotion of Scott, he obviously was not displeased with the nomination of
                    General William Henry Harrison, whose opinions were sufficiently ambiguous to permit the kind of
                    campaign he hoped for. "Our candidate stands upon elevated and enviable ground,"
                    Weed observed enthusiastically. "He has been embroiled in none of the vexing questions
                    which Van Burenism has generated."5 Better still, as Lucy Kenney
                    predicted, " [He] can be elected."6 Consequently, Weed easily
                    reconciled himself and joined Francis Granger in exclaiming, "We are now in the field
                    … 'Huzza for old 
                        Tippecanoe
                    .' "7
            
            Having insured party unity by the selection of their ticket (not to mention their refusal to prepare
                    a platform), delegates at 
                        Harrisburg
                     turned to plan a party organization of unprecedented refinement. State conventions were
                    scheduled in each state for the week of February 22, and presidential electors in the several states
                    were made responsible for encouraging local campaign activities. A huge national convention of Whig
                    young men was planned for 
                        Baltimore
                     in May.8 As Millard Fillmore phrased it in a letter to Weed,
                    "The steam must be kept up."9 No hut or hovel was too remote
                    to be included in the Whig network, which envious Democrats described as "a stupendous
                    system…. commencing in the smallest subdivisions of localities, and successively
                    combining and centralizing itself till it ascended, through town, county, and State, to the central
                    and controlling head which remained in perpetual session

                     and incessant activity, in the federal capital
                        itself."10 The spinning of Weed's net was thus begun at 
                        Harrisburg
                    , and no time was lost in beginning the process of vote ensnarement.
            At ratification meetings in January, Whigs took up their log-cabin and hard-cider rallying
                    cry—the unintended contribution of an unsuspecting Democratic correspondent for the 
                        Baltimore
                    
                    Republican.11 Thomas Elder and Richard S. Elliott, Whig
                    leaders in 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , designed the first log-cabin transparency, and noted cynically that "passion
                    and prejudice properly aroused and directed, would do about as well as principle and reason in a
                    party contest."12 Soon the welkin rang with shouts for cabins, coons,
                    and cider—symbols of a resurgent Whiggery.
            Directing the hard-cider enthusiasm was an executive committee in 
                        Washington
                     with offices in two room of the 
                        Washington
                     City Hall. Representative Rice Garland of 
                        Louisiana
                     was chairman of this committee, and Representative John C. Clark of 
                        New York
                    , a "warm friend" of Weed's, was secretary. All members
                    were Congressmen: John Bell of 
                        Tennessee
                    , John M. Both of 
                        Virginia
                    , Thomas Corwin of 
                        Ohio
                    , Moses H. Grinnell of 
                        New York
                    , Leverett Saltonstall of 
                        Massachusetts
                    , and Truman Smith of 
                        Connecticut
                    . This group was responsible for a staff which, according to the 
                        Washington
                    
                    Globe, consisted of government clerks and employees. Congressional franks were
                    used to avoid postage, and the Globe charged that even Capitol wagons and horses
                    were used to make deliveries. Gideon Welles, Postmaster of 
                        Hartford
                    , 
                        Connecticut
                    , in a complaint abut the abuse of the franking privilege, maintained that
                    "thirty percent of all the mail coming in to 
                        Hartford
                     originated in 
                        Washington
                    ." Thomas Ritchie, editor of the 
                        Richmond
                    
                    Enquirer, proclaimed that the committee was cheating "our honest voters
                    … by humbugs and misrepresentations—by handbills and caricatures, and
                    pamphlets and speeches … scattered broadcast."18 It was thus
                    through the varied activities of this committee that the Whig campaign in the several states
                    received direction and co-ordination.

                     Whig Congressmen into a master list which was used, according
                    to Democratic testimony, "to make every single paper of the tons of electioneering
                    documents … tell directly upon a point where it would … operate with
                        effect.14 Partisans on the committee's master list were mailed
                    copies of Charles Ogle's diatribe "On the Regal Splendor of the
                    President's Palace" in which Martin Van Buren was damned for installing a bath
                    tub in the White House; Tom Corwin's devastating "Reply to Crary" in
                    which the 
                        Michigan
                     Locofoco was caricatured "on the eve of some desperate enterprise, such as
                    giving an order to shoulder arms"; and a pamphlet entitled "The Contrast"
                    which gave voters the choice of "Harrison and Prosperity or Van Buren and Ruin."
                    Under Millard Fillmore's frank, the committee distributed the log-cabin lithographs which
                    found their way to the mastheads of most Whig papers. In addition, Democrats accused the committee
                    of publishing a spurious edition of Van Buren's biography, financing hundreds of paid
                    agents, buying votes, and "transporting vagabonds and perjured hirelings" to
                    hard-cider conventions.15
            
            As the campaign reached its climax, the executive committee issued a directive to the
                    "Central Whig Committee" of each county in the country. In addition to the usual
                    last-minute exhortations, the directive contained specific advice for the final phases of the
                    canvass. It was, in a sense, a testimonial to the meticulous nature of the Whig organization.
                    Complete poll lists were urged for each precinct, with voters listed as "good, bad, or
                    doubtful." Vigilance committees were suggested to persuade doubtful voters and to get out
                    the vote. Conveyances were to be furnished the aged and infirm. "Urge every friend of
                    Republican Institutions to go to the polls," said the directive; "not one vote
                    should be lost." Then, in a final admonition mailed to every precinct committeeman, the
                    executive committee concluded, "Let us entreat you, as you value your rights and liberties,
                    to lose no time in effecting … [these measures for victory."16
            
            In addition to the executive committee, there was a personal campaign committee headed by Colonel
                    Charles S. Todd, editor of the

                     handle his troublesome correspondence. Called "the
                    conscience-keeping committee," this group attempted to shield Old Tip from embarrassing
                    questions—an operation which led Democrats to dub Harrison "General
                    Mum," and to ridicule him as "A Man in an Iron Cage."17
            
            State Whig organizations were no less active than the national committees. The party network was
                    probably more tightly knit in 
                        New York
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     than in most other states, though ostensibly the whole nation was swarming with party
                    organizers. In the Empire State, William L. Marcy observed that "all the Whig devils it
                    seems are let loose … [upon us]." 
                        New York
                     Whigs had the advantage of controlling state offices, and Governor William H. Seward,
                    with Weed's careful counsel, made effective use of the patronage. "Applications
                    for office are my chief correspondence," Seward confessed. The 
                        New York
                     governor was quite properly impressed by Weed's "magic
                    influence." "How much I am endebted to you!" he exclaimed in a letter
                    shortly after his election. "You are a wonderful being—a mystery—but
                    to me a guardian spirit, whose gentle influences seem to prepare the very atmosphere 1 breathe with
                    grateful odors."18
            
            From his 
                        Albany
                     command post, Weed, "the Jolly Drummer," kept a painstaking watch on
                    all party workers from senators to precinct captains. His worrisome correspondence included
                    "heartburning and jealousy" over the appointment of surrogate in 
                        Troy
                    , troubles with abolitionists in Utica, and rivalries between anti-Masons in the West
                    and conservatives in 
                        New York
                     City. "We have hired a shrewd sensible man to distribute … our
                    papers,"—so ran a typical field report from his outpost in 
                        Syracuse
                    .19 It was Weed who promoted the 
                        Baltimore
                     ratification convention, established a nation-wide campaign paper, and collected party

                     City. His close attention to the day-to-day details of politics made him the axis of
                    the organization network in 
                        New York
                    , if not in the entire nation.
            In 
                        Ohio
                    , the Whig organization was completed at a rousing convention in 
                        Columbus
                     on February 22, when, according to enthusiastic accounts, over twenty-three thousand
                    sloshed through the February mud to promote the first Buckeye president. The activity of Ohioans was
                    evident in the anonymous letter of one Hard-Ciderite who disclosed that he had devoted the whole
                    month of February to "aiding in the organization of Harrison and Tyler Clubs, attending
                    Harrison meetings, writing 
                        Tippecanoe
                     letters, or making log-cabin and hard-cider speeches." Elaborate efforts were
                    made in 
                        Ohio
                     to lure the support of repentant Jacksonians. Former Van Buren followers were organized
                    into "Harrison Reform Clubs," and over seven thousand of this group met in 
                        Columbus
                     at the height of the campaign to march to the chant of "
                  Van, Van, Van
               —
                        Van
                    's a used-up man." It was thus not without reason that Sam Medary,
                    Democratic editor of the 
                  
                            Ohio
                         Statesman, wrote President Van Buren that he had "never seen such a
                    state of things as witnessed in 
                        Ohio
                     at this time."20
            
            Indeed, there was a high political fever throughout the entire West. As one frontier politician put
                    it, "There is a constant gathering of the people by thousands for the purpose of warming
                    each other for the fight." The pattern in each state was much the same, with presidential
                    electors taking the lead in organizational activities. Abraham 
                        Lincoln
                    , a Whig elector in 
                        Illinois
                    , prepared a directive for county organizations which ordered local leaders to set up
                    precinct committees, prepare poll lists, and report election prospects regularly. "Let no
                    local interests divide you; but select candidates that can succeed," he warned.
                    "Our plan of operations will of course be concealed from everyone except our good
                    friends." In accordance with this directive, meetings were held in every county of the
                    state, many of which 
                        Lincoln
                     attended in his capacity as elector. The 
                        Michigan
                     network described by John Van Fossan in a letter to Weed was similar to the one in 
                        Illinois
                    . "I shall make arrangements to have a complete poll list of every town
                    … by the 15th of October," Van Fussan promised. In Indiana, Richard W. Thompson,
                    just beginning his political career, stumped the state as an elector promoting local organization
                    and making 
                  
                     20

                     the hills and valleys "resound with praises of '
                        Tippecanoe
                     and Tyler, too!'"21
            
            Southern Whigs, also, were organizing. From 
                        Kentucky
                    , Robert P. Letcher, Whig candidate for governor, reported optimistically that he had
                    finished the work in thirty-one counties by early May. "There is apparently real zeal and
                    animation … in every place," he testified in a letter to Senator John J.
                    Crittenden, who returned from 
                        Washington
                     two months later to find a continuous round of barbecues, meetings, and conventions.
                    "The Whigs… appear to be roused, or rousing themselves to the contest,"
                    the 
                        Kentucky
                     Senator observed hopefully. In 
                        Louisiana
                    , important state committees were meeting daily, and in the testimony of one observer,
                    "politics had all but excluded the more prosaic pursuits of existence." In 
                        Maryland
                    , Whig members of the state legislature met in March and established a state central
                    committee to "superintend the elections and to adopt such measures as may be deemed useful
                    in promoting the success of the party." 
                        Virginia
                     Whigs distributed fifty thousand copies of their address to the people. Thomas Ritchie
                    complained that in 
                        Virginia
                     Whig electors were "traveling orators, who … traverse their
                    districts, mount the stumps, abuse the Administration, puff the military chieftan, and gull the
                    People." "Never," Ritchie concluded, "have I seen a Junto so
                    fanatical, so desperate in their purposes or so reckless in their means."22
            
            County committees worked assiduously to establish 
                        Tippecanoe
                     clubs in every precinct. Eight thousand Whigs were said to have attended a ward meeting
                    in 
                        Boston
                    ; in 
                        New York
                     and 
                        Baltimore
                    , every ward had a club, and many had log-cabin headquarters. The first cabin-raising
                    took place in Governor sward's home town of 
                        Auburn
                    , and with Weed's encouragement cabin headquarters were soon being erected
                    throughout the country. "Every paper we open," observed a 
                        Frankfort
                    ,

                    attractive social centers, as well as meeting places and reading rooms. An advertisement for the
                    Seventeenth Ward

                        New York
                    , for example, promised "a rousing meeting … [with] music, public
                    speaking, good singing, and hard cider." The 
                        Cleveland
                     cabin was open daily, and local committee members assured their fellow partisans that
                    "the latchstring was always out." Though Temperance Whigs were inclined to call
                    them "intelligence centers," it was obvious that the cabins were designed more for
                    revelry than reading. Democrats self-righteously referred to them as "groggeries"
                    and likened them to army barracks where "the vicious and depraved … were
                    … debauched with liquor, stimulated with lying and inflammatory harangues, and with
                    vulgar and ribald songs, and corrupted with money." "The log cabin!"
                    exclaimed the 
                        Washington
                    
                    Globe, "a Federal trap, baited with hard cider to catch honest
                    people's votes in."23
            
            Whig activities were by no means limited to metropolitan areas. Guernsey County, 
                        Ohio
                    , for example, reported a county committee of thirty-one members and 
                        Tippecanoe
                     clubs in every township. Whigs in Miami and 
                        Delaware
                     counties published their own campaign newspapers. In 
                        Louisiana
                    , every parish in the state had its 
                        Tippecanoe
                     club. Whigs in 
                        Washington
                     County, 
                        Maryland
                    , organized a well-knit group directed by the typical county committee of thirty-one
                    members. Before the campaign was hardly under way in 
                        Virginia
                    , leaders announced that seventeen communities had erected log-cabin headquarters. In 
                        Vermont
                    , the Young Men's Whig Convention was "a second edition of the great
                    outpouring for Harrison at the Capital of 
                        Ohio
                    ." Delegates arrived "on horse and foot, in sleighs and six-horse
                    teams, with banners, music, mottoes, &c." The Whigs of 
                        Windsor
                     County, 
                        Vermont
                    , held "the largest convention ever assembled in the state."24 Thus even in the rural areas, partisans of the 
                        Ohio
                     General fabricated an effective party network.
            Local Whig organizations were working units and not merely skeletal hierarchies, a fact which was
                    demonstrated by the various Whig conventions. The Harrisonites of 
                        Wheeling

                    , for example, were reputed to have entertained thirty thousand visitors at their huge
                    gathering on September 3. To feed this horde, hospitable Wheelingites provided a public table with
                    three hundred and sixty hams, twenty-six sheep, twenty calves, fifteen hundred pounds of beef, eight
                    thousand pounds of bread, over one thousand pounds of cheese, and forty-five hundred pies.
                    "Besides this," reported Niles' Register,
                    "every Harrison house was abundantly supplied, and open throughout the day." Whigs
                    of 
                        Fayette
                     County, 
                        Ohio
                    , displayed their party discipline by traveling in parade formation to the convention at 
                        Chillicothe
                    . The marshal of the procession announced the various places of assembly along the line
                    of march and issued orders that each man be provided "with three days' rations,
                    equipage, &c." On their arrival at the convention grounds, they found that the
                    local arrangements committee had provided over twenty thousand pounds of bread, two hundred bushels
                    of potatoes, six hundred pounds of butter, twenty-two barrels of flour, seventy sheep, eighty slabs
                    of bacon, twenty-one steers, and numerous other provisions. In addition, the Scioto
                        Gazette claimed that "Colonel Henry Brush accommodated … upwards of twenty-five hundred persons" at his residence, and that other Whig
                    families fed from two hundred to four hundred transients.25 Whig logistics thus
                    testified to the vigor of Whig organization.
            In their network, Whigs did not neglect special interest groups: racial minorities, religious sects,
                    and old soldiers. Though the party had a reputation for being antiforeign, a special effort was made
                    in 1840 to appeal to the various racial groups, particularly the Germans. 
                        German
                        Tippecanoe
                     clubs had strong memberships in 
                  Cincinnati, Baltimore, New York
               , and 
                        Philadelphia
                    , and each boasted a 
                        German
                    -language campaign paper. Francis J. Grund and Isaac Rand published campaign biographies
                    which translated the glories of 
                        Tippecanoe
                     into 
                        German
                    . The shamrock decorated a log cabin at the 
                        Tippecanoe
                     Battleground Celebration in Indiana, and Judge Jacob Burnet's 
                        Harrisburg
                     speech was translated into Welsh. In 
                        Illinois
                    , Whig leaders eagerly cultivated the Mormons. In appealing to Protestants, Horace
                    Greeley attacked Robert Dale Owen, a Democratic elector in Indiana. "Whenever you find a
                    bitter, blasphemous Atheist and enemy of Marriage, Morality, and the Social Order," Greeley
                    proclaimed, "there you may be certain of one vote for Van Buren." Greeley also
                    suggested 
                  
                     25

                     that Protestant ministers be circularized with Locofoco Orestes
                    Brownson's atheistic pamphlet on "The Laboring Classes," in hopes that
                    it might alienate religious voters. Meanwhile, Seward and Weed wooed the Catholic vote in 
                        New York
                     by hinting the possibility of state funds for parochial schools. "Their
                    project is to alienate a portion of our vote," wrote T. D. James to Van Buren.
                    "They would coalesce with the Devil himself, could he give them votes."26
            
            To gain a wider working-class audience, state and county committees published inexpensive campaign
                    newspapers which were financed and circulated by the faithful. Weed laid plans for Horace
                    Greeley's Log Cabin at the 
                        Harrisburg
                     convention, and by the conclusion of the canvass it had a circulation of over eighty
                    thousand. While the Log Cabin was the most popular of the campaign papers, it was
                    by no means without rivals. In 
                        Illinois
                    , the state central committee, under the guidance of 
                        Lincoln
                    , supported the Old Soldier. "Every Whig in the State must
                    take it," 
                        Lincoln
                     brusquely informed county committee-men, " [and] you must raise a fund
                    … for extra copies … for distribution among … our
                        opponents."27 No lover of politics was in want for political
                    commentary in 1840. 
                        Ohio
                     alone had at least seventeen party publications, in addition to the regular Whig press.
                    In Elyria, 
                        Ohio
                    , Old Tip's Broom "swept out corruption";
                    in 
                        Cleveland
                    , the Axe chopped vigorously at Locofoco officeholders; the Harrisonian of 
                        Athens
                    , 
                        Georgia
                    , was "touched with States' Rights Principles"; the Spirit of '76 in 
                        Nashville
                    , 
                        Tennessee
                    , urged a restoration of republican government;28 and the Hard Cider Press in 
                        Chicago
                     "went for Harrison without a why or wherefore."
            Whig editorial efforts were supplemented by stump oratory. For the first time, a presidential
                    candidate abandoned the traditional Olympia of seclusion for the fervid clamor of the arena. In what
                    his opponents damned as an unseemly exhibition, Harrison delivered twenty-three speeches in 
                        Ohio
                     in support of his own candidacy. The executive committee financed John W. Bear,
                    "the Buckeye Blacksmith," on a nationwide expedition in which he delivered 331
                    speeches. Webster

                    discussion," and Nathan Sargent recalled that there were "five thousand or more
                    speakers … 'on the stump'… from one end of the country
                    to the other, their services everywhere and all the time in demand."30
            
            It was obvious enough, particularly to the Democrats, that an unprecedented amount of money was
                    necessary to finance such extensive political operations: the cabin-raisings, the cider, the
                    subsidized newspapers, and the itinerant orators, all of whom were mercenaries, said the Globe, "from DANIEL WEBSTER down to the TRAVELLING BEAR."
                    "Where does the money come from?" shouted the Locofoco orators, suspecting
                    "a huge corruption fund."31 Vindictive Van Burenites were
                    unaware, however, of the cash transaction in which Abbott Lawrence, operating through an
                    intermediary, placed five thousand dollars at the disposal of the Cincinnatus of 
                        North Bend
                    . Weed boasted of collecting $580.00 in 
                        New York
                     City in less than two and one-half hours, and Edward Curtis testified to the
                    "Jolly Drummer's" genius "with the flour
                    speculators." In a complaint which labeled Philip Hone "a political
                    liability" because of his archaic political ideas, Harman C. Westervelt admitted
                    reluctantly that Hone's "purse had been a benefit to the party."32 Merchants of 
                        Boston
                     and 
                        New York
                     were accused of giving Webster a gift of $63,000.00, and with some justification a
                    prominent 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Democrat proclaimed that "Bank and Stock gamblers are the life of the
                    opposition." Sam Medary concurred with this analysis in a letter to 
                        Van

                    money," he wrote reassuringly, "there would be no contest at all."33
            
            Despite Democratic charges, not all the money came from major capitalists. A substantial portion was
                    raised by the local organizations on their own subscriptions. Samuel Lyman, for example, wrote Weed
                    from Utica that all the money needed for the county campaign was pledged and that it might even be
                    possible for them to aid their neighbors. 
                        Lincoln
                     raised money by local subscription in 
                        Illinois
                    ,34 and each delegate to the 
                        Baltimore
                     Ratification Convention was assessed for the support of the Whig press. Thad Stevens
                    worked out a system of rebates from canal contractors to support his operations in 
                        Pennsylvania
                    ,35 and Weed assessed workers on the 
                        Erie
                     Canal to help finance the Log Cabin.36 Most
                    speakers paid their own traveling expenses, though steamboat companies and railways often aided by
                    giving special convention rates, and local Whig committees usually furnished a public table to help
                    feed visitors. Candidates and party leaders, also, were forced to contribute substantial amounts.
                    "I am saddled with an enormous postage," Old Tip complained to one of his
                    correspondents, adding a not entirely facetious suggestion that Congress extend him the franking
                        privilege.37
            
            The fanfare of the canvass of 1840 has often served to obscure its significance, since many have
                    tended to dismiss it as little more than a colorful political circus. The great commotion was in
                    fact a testimonial to meticulous party organization—and a refutation to those who contend
                    that political organizations were relatively undeveloped before the Civil War. Adopting a log-cabin
                    vocabulary, Whig leaders in 1840 gave a belated acquiesence to the methods of the new
                    democracy—much to the distress of antediluvian elements in the party who abhorred
                    appealing to the mob—even when the appeal was designed to promote a conservative victory.

            The Harrison sweep to victory in Indiana and the nation in 1840 resulted in the complete rout of the
                    Hoosier Democrats. The movement continued through the congressional election of 1841, leaving the
                    Indiana Democrats with one seat in Congress. The hopes of the party were at low ebb: the combination
                    of state and national electoral defeats had robbed the Democracy of state and local offices as well
                    as the fruits of patronage. In order for the rehabilitation process to begin, it was necessary to
                    overhaul completely the party machinery.
            The rejuvenation, however, was not slow in developing. A new party organ, the Indiana
                        State Sentinel, under the editorship of Jacob Page Chapman and George A. Chapman, began
                    publication in the summer of 1841. The Chapmans, originally from 
                        Massachusetts
                    , had published the 
                  
                            Wabash
                         Enquirer at 
                        Terre Haute
                     before coming to the state capital. With the motto, "Crow Chapman
                    Crow," at its masthead, the Sentinel was to become a powerful mouthpiece
                    for the Democracy.1
            
            By the summer of 1842, the Democrats had gained control of the state legislature and were prepared
                    for the congressional elections of 1843. The party prospects appeared brighter.
            It was apparent that the Democrats had freed themselves of the old leadership and the old battle
                    cries, and were taking up the standards of the so-called New Democracy. As they laid their plans for
                    the coming election, they saw that the Whigs had furnished them with issues upon which to wage the
                    campaign. There was, for example, the effect that the halting of the canal and road program had had
                    on the outlets to market, leaving them in a sad state of repair. This condition, coupled with the
                    aftermath of the depression of 1837 which was hindering economic progress, the Democrats blamed on
                    the Whigs. The Whig tariff of 1842 and the attitude of the Indiana Whigs in favoring a state rather
                    than a national bank had weakened their party unity; and following the breach between

                     Henry Clay and John Tyler, the Whig party experienced even
                    further demoralization. The Democrats of Indiana were ready to take advantage of the political
                    misfortune of their opponents.
            The New Democracy, however, was more than a political rebuttal to the Whig program. Under the
                    guidance of such talented orators as Robert Dale Owen, Joseph Wright, James Whitcomb, and John W.
                    Davis, the Democracy pled for human rights, individual liberty, and private initiative. The
                    sentiments of such western leaders as William Allen of 
                        Ohio
                     made the rounds of the Hoosier press: and during the congressional contests, there were
                    many debates enlarging on the party principles and involving such issues as the tariff, the
                    currency, and internal improvements.3
            
            This campaign centered less about personalities than had the campaigns of the past. The change in
                    tactics was in part indicative of new leadership, but more than that it was a reflection of the
                    growing force of the western progress; it was part and parcel of the growing sectional consciousness
                    of the economic needs of the West. The result was that, being out of office nationally as well as
                    locally, the Democracy could become a party of opportunism and could promise relief from the
                    economic burdens under which the citizenry labored.
            The Hoosier campaign of 1843 was termed by the Chapmans in their journal as a revolution. The Whigs
                    were swept out of office almost completely, and for the first time since statehood, the Democrats
                    had elected a governor. Jesse Bright rode into state office as lieutenant-governor, and his brother
                    Michael was appointed state agent.4 James Morrison was elected by the
                    legislature to rule the state bank;5 William E. English became clerk of the
                    assembly; and Andrew L. Robinson, who was to become a Free Soil candidate by 1852, was elected
                    speaker of the House.6 The Democrats had also gained control of the legislature.
            On the national scene, whereas in 1841, there was only one Democratic congressman from the state, now
                    the party had elected members in eight out of the ten districts.

            Edward Hannegan, although elected to office prior to this important election, was in this new order,
                    having replaced Tilghman A. Howard when the latter was deserted by the Democrats.7 Hannegan's victory was a popular one, representing another instance in which the
                    party had freed itself of the control of the old liners.
            The housecleaning was about complete as far as the Indiana Democrats were concerned by the time of
                    the opening of the coming presidential campaign.8
            
            The campaign in 1843 had centered about the tariff as far as national questions were concerned, with 
                        Texas
                     and 
                        Oregon
                     playing a minor role—if any at all. Yet in the summer of that year, 
                        Oregon
                     and

                     had come to the fore as national questions and were being carried along by the buoyant
                    and optimistic wave of expansionism. Indiana was in the heartland of this rising western sentiment.
                    Gradually the movement for expansion came into the political arena of the state and the nation. In
                    October of 1843, Robert Dale Owen, newly elected congressman, began breathing the spirit of manifest
                    destiny when he declared in a letter to his constituents that the time had come for them to assert
                    their just claims and to take possession of the territory [
                        Oregon
                    ], without bloodshed, before the Hudson's Bay Company, profiting by the joint
                    occupancy, made peaceful penetration impossible.9
            
            The state legislature also pressed the 
                        Oregon
                     question by joint resolution. Young Willis A. Gorman, 
                        Bloomington

                        Minnesota
                    , as chairman of the committee on federal relations, announced: "that the
                    settlement and immediate occupation of the 
                        Oregon
                     Territory, is big with interest to the 
                        United States

                     7 Howard, South Carolinian by birth, had read law in the office of
                            Hugh L. White in 
                                Tennessee

                            Whitcomb and Joseph A. Wright. The friends of Howard never forgave the Democracy of Indiana
                            for its desertion of the General. William W. Woollen, Biographical and

                     our trappers, traders, and settlers, and are now using this
                    important port to bring British goods free of duty, to trade upon within our borders….
                    War is now the favorite policy with 
                        England
                    , and war with us too. The patriot's bosom, and the soldier's
                    sword respond, 'Let it come rather than dishonor.'"10 He concluded with the demand that Congress take active and effective steps immediately.
            On January 4, 1844, just a month after the joint resolution of the legislature, Robert Dale Owen
                    introduced into Congress a resolution to end the joint occupation, and by the twenty-fourth, Owen
                    was making a formal reply to the house committee that had decided his proposal was inexpedient.11 Owen was aroused by this to make his maiden speech in Congress in which he
                    upbraided the committee for its action. "We have faults and failings enough, God
                    knows—we of the West; but cowardice—tame, cold blooded
                    cowardice—the craven spirit that would desert a comrade in his utmost need, that, at
                    least, is no part of our character."12 The House apparently felt no
                    inclination to debate the subject.
            In the nation, Owen's speech was eminently successful; it was reprinted and distributed
                    widely in the press, appearing in two Democratic journals in 
                        New York
                     as well as in the Globe, the national party organ.13
            
            In the Senate, Hannegan was also busy with the 
                        Oregon
                     question. He introduced the joint resolutions of the Indiana legislature into the
                    Senate in February, 1844, and later in the same month took the floor again to attack Rufus Choate of 
                        Massachusetts
                     for his fear that a war might result. He decried those who disregarded national honor,
                    glory, and integrity for cost, and he attacked the senator from 
                        South Carolina
                     who had reputedly characterized the settlers who had gone to 
                        Oregon
                     as wanton adventurers whose movements were injurious to the best interests of the
                    nation. On the contrary, said Hannegan, this was the spirit of America. "It was this spirit
                    which gave to our country the brightest jewel in her diadem—the great and mighty
                    West," he cried.14 With William Allen of

                        Illinois
                    , Hannegan was one of a triumvirate of western leaders in the Senate who were forwarding
                    the cause of expansion into the great Northwest.15
            
            The eighteen senators who voted to end the joint occupations were thus providing an issue for the
                    campaign of 1844. Hannegan in the Senate and Owen in the House were willing to take Indiana along
                    with them in their demands.
            The expansionist mood also asserted itself in the case of the annexation of 
                        Texas
                     during the pre-election maneuvers of the political parties. While the northwestern
                    Democrats were shouting for a settlement of the 
                        Oregon
                     boundary, their southern brethren were leading the movement to annex the 
                        Texas
                     Republic. The result of the expansionist demands was a single plank in the Democratic
                    platform in 1844 which aimed to satisfy the leaders of both sectional interests; yet the idea of
                    manifest destiny had its ardent supporters in both sections. It is important to consider the Indiana
                    Democrats' position in this controversy.
            The 
                        Texas
                     question did not come in for congressional discussion until the eve of the 
                        Baltimore
                     convention. The matter had been kept in the background partly by the secrecy of the
                    negotiations in progress and partly because it would have been unwise politically for the followers
                    of Martin Van Buren to allow expansion to become the burning issue of the coming campaign, since his
                    stand on the question was one of a "wait and see" character. For the Democracy of
                    the Northwest, it was difficult to become enthusiastic in such a situation, but when it was
                    suggested that the two prongs of the expansionist drive be linked, the Democratic congressional
                    delegation from Indiana voted solidly for it. The resolution, however, was laid on the table.16
            
            The Chapmans in 
                        Indianapolis
                     editorialized on the question by urging that it be left alone at the moment as it might
                    endanger the political hopes of Van Buren.17
            
            On the whole, the Whigs opposed the annexation of 
                        Texas
                    , with only a few of the party members feeling much concern. Calvin Fletcher, an early
                    settler and by the 1840's leading citizen of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , confided to his diary that "the

                     gives me some gloomy apprehension."18 The uneasiness that he felt was not general, however, as evidenced by his entry several
                    days later: "the subject of the annexation of 
                        Texas
                     makes some stir among the people in various states but great apathy prevails
                        here."19
            
            The legislature, although it had passed a joint resolution advocating the settlement of the 
                        Oregon
                     question, had failed to carry a similar resolution concerning 
                        Texas
                     beyond a first reading. A memorial from 
                        South Carolina
                     had been lost on the governor's desk and Whitcomb had forwarded it to the
                    House shortly before adjournment with an apologetic note.20
            
            The apathy was short-lived, for a month later Calvin Fletcher was filled with more than
                    "gloomy apprehension." He was now, it seemed, thoroughly aroused by the 
                        Texas
                     question. He wrote: "The annexation of 
                        Texas
                     seems to be the great exciting question at present I deplore the state of affairs the
                    political degradation, the corruption of men at the head of national affairs I fear the multitude of
                    demogogues exciting the ignorant in the non slave holding states not to reject territory like 
                        Texas
                     as imprudent in their eyes as to refuse the fair offer of a farm on some plausible
                    pretext—& the influence of the Slave states—both united it will be an
                    interposition of 
                        Providence
                     if the annexation does not take place—But may I learn prudence, patience,
                    & forbearence in all these matters—Trust in God and his abundant
                        mercies."21
            
            Politically, some Indiana Democrats had the uniting of the diverging interests in mind even if it
                    meant selecting a new presidential candidate. Van Buren seemed to them a bad political risk.
                    Apparently Fletcher's ire was directed at such political tactics as Tilghman Howard had
                    in mind when he wrote from 
                        Washington
                     to a friend: "You will see Van Buren's and 
                        Clay
                    's letters on 
                        Texas
                    . I do not agree with either of them, as I regard the acquisition of 
                        Texas
                     a great moment to the 
                        United States
                    . Mr. V. B.'s letter has given great dissatisfaction to the Southern members
                    here, and there is much confusion and misgiving in the party. A third man is talked of, and Cass
                    often mentioned. I think Democrats should not be too prompt in

            Howard was not alone in his estimate of the situation. The Hoosier congressmen let it be known that
                    they were extremely skeptical of Van Buren's chances. Albert Kennedy from Muncietown,
                    representing northeastern Indiana in the House, wrote to the Globe that he had
                    used all the proper means available to secure the defeat of the squire of Linden-wald. Furthermore,
                    he declared, he had been engaged in the task for two months.23 The 
                        Ohio
                     delegation in Congress charged that this movement was part of a concerted effort among
                    some congressmen in 
                        Washington
                    . The Hoosiers did not deny their feelings on the subject, but to remove the odium of
                    being accused as conspirators, they replied to the charges of the 
                        Ohio
                     Democrats, admitting they had doubts as to the outcome of the election, but stating
                    they were not aware of the "concerted efforts" spoken of by the Ohioans. This
                    denial was published in the Globe, headed by the name of Edward Hannegan and
                    followed by a list of the entire delegation with the exception of Robert Dale Owen, who remained
                    loyal to Van Buren.24
            
            The 
                        New Harmony
                     reformer, who was by now a staunch advocate of manifest destiny, was plainly worried by
                    the division in the ranks of the Democracy. He wrote a letter to the Globe under
                    the name "Tullius" justifying immediate annexation, but at the same time he warned
                    the extremists that the 
                        Baltimore
                     convention should decide whether the 
                        Texas
                     issue would become a party principle. Owen was finding it difficult to be an advocate
                    of manifest destiny while professing loyalty to the presidential aspirations of Martin Van Buren.
            As the meeting of the convention at 
                        Baltimore
                     neared, the actions of certain Indiana congressmen had made it rather clear to the
                    Democracy of Indiana and the nation that Van Buren was not their choice for the presidential
                    nomination.
            If Van Buren was not in agreement with the Democrats of Indiana on the 
                        Texas
                     issue, Lewis Cass of 
                        Michigan
                     seemed to be completely in line with the party leaders. Four days after the Globe letters appeared, this politician wrote to Hannegan that he was in favor of
                    immediate annexation, and he

                     outlined both the material and the military reasons for it.
                    Cass claimed he feared the black troops that the British might unloose on the southern states if
                    given the opportunity. Politically, Cass felt that more and more American people were in favor of
                    annexation and since they were, action should come soon.25
            
            Hannegan thus had an unequivocal statement on a much feared question that he could use in advancing
                    the cause of Cass.
            General Cass had begun the groundwork for his campaign in Indiana at an early time. The state
                    convention, held at 
                        Indianapolis
                     in January of 1843, had been filled with Cass supporters who tried to secure a pledge
                    that the Indiana delegation would go to 
                        Baltimore
                     supporting him. Their effort, however, had failed and the state convention had
                    requested all the prominent candidates to submit replies to a set of questions concerning the bank,
                    the tariff, land, limited veto, and whether the potential candidate would support the Democratic
                    party if he did not receive the nomination.26
            
            The replies were all safe enough as submitted by Van Buren, John Calhoun, Colonel Richard Johnson,
                    James Buchanan, and Cass. As Van Buren's correspondent from 
                        Indianapolis
                     put it: it was a case of answering as fully as if this were the first time that the
                    questions had been asked of him. Calhoun was amazed that he should be considered for the office.
                    This chivalrous attitude was not too well received by such partisan Hoosiers as Judge John Law, the
                    loyal Van Burenite.27
            
            The Cass campaign began in full swing with the occasion of the opening of the canal at 
                        Fort Wayne
                     linking the Indiana and 
                        Ohio
                     divisions of the project. A great celebration was planned for July 4, 1843, and by the
                    first of the month, the guests had begun to arrive. The committees for the occasion were well
                    staffed with Hoosier Democrats, including Bright, Hannegan, Abel C. Pepper, Robert Brackenridge, and
                    Ethan

                     A. Brown. Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and General Winfield
                    Scott had been invited but had declined the opportunity. The joyous occasion was addressed by
                    General Cass. His remarks in themselves were innocent enough, but the meeting of the Democratic
                    leaders was sufficient to give the Cass advocates a chance to begin their move toward capturing the
                    caucus of the state for the 
                        Michigan
                     Democrat.
            It seems to be clear that the Hoosier Democrats had not turned suddenly against Van Buren because of
                    his attitude on the 
                        Texas
                     question. This may well have been the excuse they needed to cast him aside, explaining
                    that it was all for party harmony. The unity of the party was of primary concern to the politician.
                    At the same time, manifest destiny was a solid tenet of political faith to many. To men such as
                    Hannegan, these two goals were not in conflict—they were concerned with the fact that
                    both sections, North and South, wanted more land; that slavery went with the 
                        Texas
                     acquisition was more of a fringe issue, as it were.
            Thus when the convention met in 
                        Baltimore
                    , the Indiana delegation was prepared to support Cass. Those who remained true to Van
                    Buren feared 
                        Texas
                     and claimed that the congressional junto was not in tune with the voting Democracy.28
            
            With Cass as the majority choice of the Indiana delegation, the national convention met in 
                        Baltimore
                     on May 27, 1844. The Hoosiers did not figure to any great extent in the proceedings, as
                    reported by the Globe, although Jesse Bright, who was beginning his long career as
                    committeeman and manipulator, represented Indiana on the rules committee. When the two-thirds rule
                    was introduced in order to block the aspirations of Van Buren, the Indiana delegates, along with
                    those from 
                        Illinois
                     and from most of the southern states, cast their votes in favor of the rule; 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        New York
                     dissented, and 
                        Pennsylvania
                     split its vote. The crucial test of the convention, however, came with the balloting
                    for the presidential candidate. On the first ballot, the Hoosiers cast three votes for Van Buren and
                    nine for Cass; on the fifth roll call, only one delegate remained faithful to the former president;
                    on the eighth ballot when the tide turned in favor of James K. Polk, the dark horse candidate, the
                    Indiana delegation still cast its vote in favor of Cass. Only on the final ballot did the Hoosiers
                    support Polk in acclamation.

                            Vincennes
                        , May 15, 1844, Van Buren Papers.
            
            
            The supporters of Van Buren did not accept defeat easily, Judge Law, a delegate, was indignant when
                    he wrote: "The 
                        Texas
                     question was all a humbug—it offered an opportunity to the malcontents to do
                    what they had already determined on—producing division and discontent, and making this
                    the pretext for the apostacy.29 In spite of this attitude, Law continued to
                    support the party and prepared himself for the coming campaign.
            The Whigs, on the defensive, attempted to arouse the electorate with a new appeal to the common man,
                    calling themselves this time the "hob nails." 
                        Clay
                    , the choice of the party, had begun his campaign in Indiana in 1842 at a great barbecue
                    held in his honor at 
                        Indianapolis
                    . This conclave was so successful that the party decided to carry the campaign to the
                    people on the same grounds, adding for more effectiveness a speakers' bureau and more
                    campaign newspapers. In their arguments, however, they proved to be weak: 
                        Clay
                     had eliminated himself on the 
                        Texas
                     issue, and the attacks by Whitcomb on the tariff, along with the unpopularity of
                    distribution as a land program, made their position difficult. The eloquent Hannegan was arousing
                    the voters on the question of 
                        Texas
                     and 
                        Oregon
                    , to which the Whigs countered: "We say this is a question that rises above all
                    party. It means union or disunion; the free North will never submit to it; the free West will not
                    submit to such a tax merely to spread slavery. Our free laborers are in favor of a tariff. The
                    admission of 
                        Texas
                     is a step forward in the abandonment of our tariff system."30
            
            The votes of the Free Soilers, who had nominated Birney as their party's candidate, were
                    of concern to both the Democrats and Whigs; the Whigs attempted to make concessions to gather in
                    this vote.
            Although the August elections for the state legislature resulted in an unexpected setback for the
                    Democracy, the presidential election in November was a victory for the followers of James K.
                        Polk.31

                     1841 and 1842, the western Democrats were anxious to execute
                    the program of their party. The expansionists were particularly interested in carrying out the 
                        Baltimore
                     resolution on 
                        Texas
                     and 
                        Oregon
                    , but there was a difference of interpretation as to whether to carry out these
                    proposals immediately or to wait until after the inauguration in March.
            Soon after the Congress convened in January, 1845, the question of annexing 
                        Texas
                     arose in the House. Caleb Smith, in the Whig minority, attacked the South in general
                    and William L. Yancey in particular for appealing to patriotism, claiming 
                        Texas
                     was merely a party issue and that sufficient reasons had not been advanced for its
                        annexation.32 Thus the opportunity arose for Robert Dale Owen to deliver an
                    address filled with spell-binding phrases in which he attempted to eliminate all the objections that
                    had been raised in the debates. He declared a treaty was not necessary to annex 
                        Texas
                    ; all that was needed was a joint resolution. He attempted to dispel the fears of the
                    North regarding slavery, by claiming that it, like monarchy, was merely a temporary
                    evil—both would disappear with progress. According to him, it was not the problem of the
                    Negro that blocked the annexation, it was the Whig rejection of any annexation. His plea wound up
                    with the demand for immediate action.33
            
            Owen's speech indicated that he did not foresee the danger of a war over 
                        Texas
                    . He believed the dispersal of slavery would weaken the slave system, leading gradually
                    to emancipation in the border states. He was not concerned with the difficulties of
                    constitutionality, an attitude which prompted Samuel Sample, Whig congressman from 
                        South Bend
                    , to write to wealthy Allen Hamilton of 
                        Fort Wayne
                    : "It is passing strange that men who almost go into
                    convulsions at the idea of voting public money for the improvement of our harbors & rivers
                    can gulp down this great constitutional difficulty with the greatest ease."34
            
            Sample and Caleb Smith, alone in the House, could not halt the progress of the Democratic drive. It
                    is interesting that neither of them concerned himself with the slavery aspects of the 
                        Texas
                     question.

                        January 9, 1845, Allen Hamilton Papers, Indiana State Library, 
                            Indianapolis
                        .
            
            
            By the end of January, the 
                        Texas
                     resolution passed the House by a vote of 120 to 98, with the Indiana Democratid
                    congressmen lending their full support to the measure. A month later, the Senate passed the
                    resolution with Hannegan supporting it and Albert S. White, the Whig, dissenting.35 Thus one of the campaign pledges of 1844 had been carried out.
            Congress next began a consideration of the other half of the expansion program—
                        Oregon
                    . The enthusiasm of the northwestern Democrats increased accordingly, for it was a
                    popular issue at home. The resolutions of the state legislature, advocating the end of the joint
                    occupancy of 
                        Oregon
                    , were introduced by the Whig Senator from Indiana, Albert S. White, who took the
                    occasion to say that he was anxious to vote for a measure such as this; indeed, he claimed that he
                    was prepared to go even further than the legislature of his state had instructed him to go.36
            
            On the same day that these resolutions were introduced, the House, after discussion, passed a bill
                    providing for a territorial government for 
                        Oregon
                    . On the question of the prohibition of involuntary servitude, the only congressman who
                    saw fit to vote against an amendment to that effect was William J. Brown. On the final vote, Sample
                    went along with the Democrats while Caleb Smith reneged. When the bill, however, was received in the
                    Senate, it was voted down by the slim margin of two votes.37 Thus through
                    politics, inertia, or the presidential message, 
                        Oregon
                     was still hanging fire when the Twenty-eighth Congress adjourned for the last time.
            Before the Indiana Democrats could return to the capital, they had to face the electorate once again.
                    The summer of 1845 was devoted to congressional elections. The 
                        Texas
                     issue was out of the way and the 
                        Oregon
                     question had been aired in the national legislative chambers just enough to reveal the
                    impending difficulties over its passage.
            The campaign was in reality a continuation of the 1844 canvass. William W. Wick of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Democratic aspirant for a congressional seat, replied to the questions of the district
                    convention with the same set of political principles used by the presidential candidates in 1843
                    with one exception:

                            Ibid., 236–37, 388.
               
                     he added his views on 
                        Texas
                     and 
                        Oregon
                     by virtually repeating the party stand of 1844.38
            
            As for Robert Dale Owen, he merely stood on his record for re-election, escaping attack even on the
                    question of 
                        Texas
                    , for the Whigs of the "Pocket" refrained from considering the matter
                    from the standpoint of the extension of slavery, and the upland Southerners of his district could
                    not be aroused on this subject. Consequently, the campaign revolved, for the most part, about
                        personalities.39
            
            Despite the lack of clearcut issues in the congressional campaign, the political breezes that summer
                    did stir up some indications of the direction they were blowing. There was a continuing cry for 
                        Oregon
                    , with jingoism and emotionalism adding some interest. Sarah T. Bolton, who often served
                    as the poetess of the Democracy, composed verses for the 
                        Oregon
                     immigrant. She wrote: 
                        In 
                                Oregon
                             children of free men are dwelling;
                        They're willing to die but they can't be enslaved.
                        No, No, starry Flag we can never forget thee,
                        Till freedom is shrouded in tyranny's night;
                        Wherever we dwell we're determined to set thee,
                        And die or maintain thee unsullied and bright.40
                  
                     During the summer, the Democratic state organ was also filling its columns with warnings to
                    the Hoosiers. The Chapmans wrote: "There is, we are fearful, great danger. Ought not the
                    whole West to arouse in this matter: Will not Indiana act with her sister, 
                        Illinois
                    , and act promptly? We think so. Let our voices be heard, and rely on it, it will have a
                    powerful influence in settling this great question—the greatest to the West which has
                    been mooted since the last War. Who will take the lead? Let us hear from our strong
                        men!"41
            
            When the ballots were cast in August, the political balance remained the same. Two Whigs and eight
                    Democrats were elected to office.
            After the elections, preparations went forward for the coming session of Congress. By November, 1845,
                    the citizenry were being prepared for possible British action on the question

                     of 
                        Oregon
                    , to which one Hoosier editor responded by suggesting the counter move of placing an
                    embargo on cotton which, he said, would bring Great Britain to terms in less than six weeks. The
                    national government would buy the cotton and burn it, if necessary.42
            
            Within the Democratic ranks there was dissatisfaction over the patronage falling to the loyal
                    partisans of the party. The President, declared the 
                        Greencastle
                    
                    
                        
                            Patriot
                        
                     in August, was a tenant only, with the freehold being held by the people, not the friends of
                    John Calhoun in the South, nor Silas Wright in the North. "The Administration must be
                    misinformed of the wish and feelings of its friends West and North-West of the 
                        Ohio
                    . It must be that the Administration has been informed, that this vast district of
                    country has no pride to gratify, or they have no men with whom it is safe or prudent to do it. It
                    cannot be, that any sane man can suppose that as yet the North-West has received any rent for her
                    share in the inheritance." Since at this same time the Indiana Democrat
                    was pushing Cass for the presidency in 1848, it would seem that some Indiana Democrats were feeling
                    their political neglect early in the game. The election was over and they wanted no more promises
                    "that the administration may deem it a virtue to violate and needful to refuse any and all
                        explanation."43
            
            While the Indiana politicians were confronting the presidency with their sectional attitudes, they
                    were also expressing their views as to what their role should be in relation to other sections. The
                    western attitude was one of youth—a realization of newly found manhood—and
                    with this growing self-consciousness came bluster, show of muscle, and vigor. The confining nature
                    of the federal household bore a little heavily at times and the parental guidance of the older
                    sections was not always gratefully accepted. The western child was beginning to have a mind of its
                    own. Indeed, it wanted a new status in the family, although it did not seem to recognize that
                    responsibilities come with a more nearly adult position, and occasionally it even went so far as to
                    disclaim the parent. One Indiana politician wrote, for example: "I have been of the
                    opinion, and still believe, that if one or the other must be lost to the Union [
                        Texas
                     or 
                        Oregon
                    ], that the interest of the West would be promoted by giving New 
                        England
                     for 
                        Texas
                     and 
                  
                     42
                            Ibid., November 15, 1845.
                  
                     43
                            Ibid., August 30, 1845.
               
                    
                    
                        Oregon
                    . Those Little States, which five of them do not equal in territory the State of Indiana
                    … comes forward with their ten Senators to our two." Declaring that the East had
                    hampered the West on lands and the tariff, and had demanded for Negro representation in the South,
                    this Hoosier suggested that Daniel Webster should be authorized to make another treaty with Great
                    Britain, which would draw the eastern boundary line at the 
                        Connecticut
                     River.44
            
            These western leaders were thus frequently inciting the Hoosiers to look upon the older sections of
                    the nation as contributing to the difficulties of securing the material needs of the expanding
                    Northwest. The plan of ceding New 
                        England
                     had, of course, its ludicrous aspects.
            The road, however, was usually open to bargaining for political and economic needs that could be
                    secured only through the action of the federal government. Indiana's Hannegan, for
                    example, told Duff Green of a trade that would be offered to Calhoun and the South, prompting Green
                    to write: "I saw Hannegan of Indiana yesterday. He says that the West will be united and
                    will demand funds for the improvements of their harbours, rivers, and the 
                        Cumberland
                     road, and the graduation of the price of public land, and that if the South will give
                    these to the West the West will go with the South on the tariff."45
            
            There was nothing emotional or jingoistic about this planned tactic; it was merely a practical
                    example of the give and take of politics, one of the points of conflict that had to be resolved if
                    the bundle of interests that made up the political parties could operate to carry out the general
                    will of the body politic. To the President and Congress fell the task of adjusting these conflicts.
            On the first day of the new Congress, a correspondent wrote to the Sentinel: "
                        Oregon
                    , too, will undergo a similar keel-hauling, and the opposition will do their best to
                    sustain British policy and British interests; while the Democratic party will go on, unterrified and
                    undismayed by any threats or denunciations, either from this or the other side of the Atlantic, and
                    our just claim up to the degree of 52, 40, will be carried without faltering or flinching on our
                    part. So let it be….

                     Trust me when I say that from indications here, and among
                    Democrats all over the country, there is, and will be one voice on this question. The whole of 
                        Oregon
                     will remain ours: but whether immediate notice of occupation, or a further postponement
                    will be recommended, does not yet appear. The President's Message of to-morrow will,
                    perhaps, enlighten us as to the future policy of the President and his cabinet on this
                        point."46 The Hoosier agreed with Polk that John Bull had to be
                    treated by looking him straight in the eye. The offer of peace had been rejected, the president had
                    reported to Congress, and the cries of 54° 40' continued to be heard from
                    across the mountains. William Wick prepared his constituents for war which he claimed was
                    inevitable. Since there was prosperity in Indiana, he urged the Indianans to save all they could
                    because the western valley would be the storehouse of the Army. Their nation, he told his
                    constituents, would have to tax them to support the impending war. The editors at home had
                    anticipated war through such slogans as "Peace if practicable—war, if
                    necessary," and the Chapmans had announced, "Let it come."47
            
            The first Indiana congressman to speak on the 
                        Oregon
                     crisis was the exponent of manifest destiny, Robert Dale Owen. This time his tone was
                    not belligerent when he defended Polk from his critics who were taking him to task on his July offer
                    to compromise at 49°, an offer which had been refused by the British minister, Lord
                        Pakenham.48
            
            Also in the House, Caleb B. Smith, a staunch national Whig from the Whitewater Valley, declared that
                    this was not a western question alone. Although he did not retreat from the position that 
                        Oregon
                     should be protected, he was unwilling to end the joint convention. The West, he
                    claimed, would suffer as much from a war, which he wished to avoid, as would any other section.49
            
            Not all the Indiana representatives, however, were inclined to protect the administration or avoid
                    positive measures in securing all of 
                        Oregon
                    . There was, for example, Andrew Kennedy, the blacksmith-turned-lawyer from Muncietown,

                     district that still bore evidence of new settlement. This
                    gentleman was a professed dyed-in-the-wool Democrat who boasted that he was "one hundred
                    and fifty yards ahead of his party."50 Illiterate until manhood,
                    Kennedy represented well the self-made western leader. This "young blacksmith"
                    addressed the House on the 
                        Oregon
                     question and, unlike Owen or Smith, he did not attempt halfway measures. He recalled to
                    the reluctant Southerners that: "If the question is to be considered as a local question,
                    then I ask that we may be the judges of the course that is to be pursued. That is what we did when
                    the South came here and asked us, not to defend their own soil, but to admit into the Union a
                    foreign territory—an independent nation. If upon that question, we had hesitated, it
                    would have been said that we wished to back out. …You said, this is the golden
                    moment." Kennedy elaborated on this part of his speech in the Appendix in the Congressionad Globe by continuing: "If a northern or western man presumed to
                    question the mode or object to the time, he was denounced as recreant to the best
                    interests of the country, and suspected of secret hostility to the measure…. We went with
                    them then, and, I might almost say, we went in blind…. But this much I will tell them,
                    that their hesitation and opposition will not deter us from discharging our duty to our constituents
                    and to our country." "Where I live," said Kennedy, "this is no
                    party question. There is no difference between Whigs and Democrats on this subject. In a question
                    involving national rights, we know no party differences."51 On this
                    observation, the Hoosier congressman spoke with a modicum of truth.
            The legislature demanded the occupation, "peaceably if we can; forcibly if we
                    must," and both parties in their state conventions in January passed resolutions demanding
                    all of 
                        Oregon
                    . One of the Whig politicians, going along with the tide, wrote: "On the 
                        Oregon
                     question, we can [?] as long and loud as they—in fact I shall insist among
                    the liberty voters especially, that we are entitled to 
                        Oregon
                     and must have it to regain the political ascendancy of the Free States—and
                    by the by this is a strong argument with every sensible man who views the relative situation of
                    matters & things in their proper light."52

            As the debates in Congress wore on, endless in duration, the Indiana delegation produced more
                    advocates of expansion, including Owen, who apparently changed his tune and decided to help carry
                    out the measure, and William W. Wick, who began an attack on Robert Barnwell Rhett, the 
                        South Carolina
                     secessionist who was vigorously supporting Calhoun's policy of
                    "masterful activity" and who had his own private interest in keeping the peace
                    with 
                        England
                    . Wick claimed that the West would lose much by a war: "The Northwest makes as
                    many clear dollars, in proportion to her population, from the export of her wheat and other
                    products, as 
                        South Carolina
                     does from the export of her cotton…. We sell our produce wherever it is
                    wanted—to 
                        England
                    , when her starving population require it —and to 
                        South Carolina
                    , when her cotton and rice crops are good, and her terrapin crop fails." Wick
                    continued by attacking the nullification views of 
                        South Carolina
                    , saying that if her politicians had any political ambitions, they would have to include 
                        Oregon
                    . He then raised the question of sectional bargaining: "In the Northwest we go
                    for all the issues of 1844. I regret to see that some portion of the party is hanging back; perhaps
                    it is expected to save the tariff of 1842…. We annexed the territory of 
                        Texas
                    . We in the Northwest charge nothing for our assistance in that matter. We went
                    'on our own hook' on that question."53
            
            Charles Cathcart, representing the extreme northwestern part of the state, carried on the upbraiding
                    of southern party members who were reluctant to act on the 
                        Oregon
                     question. He harangued at length the policy of masterful inactivity. "But this
                    doctrine of 'masterly inactivity': I cannot find it in the proceedings of the
                    Democratic convention. I may, however, see room for its inference from the neglect to mention 
                        Texas
                     and 
                        Oregon
                     in the proceedings of the Whig convention; but, sir, that is not the chart which I
                    steer by…. There is, however, something superlatively ridiculous in this idea of masterly
                    inactivity and bed chamber diplomacy."54
            
            In the Senate, Indiana had its 
                        Oregon
                     enthusiast, par excellence, Edward A. Hannegan. On February 10, 1845, the fiery Hoosier
                    introduced his resolutions demanding all of 
                        Oregon
                    . Insisting that the voice of the people forbade all compromise on this issue, he
                    leveled his oratory at Calhoun and the policy of masterful inactivity. When he was reminded by W.

                     T. Colquitt of 
                        Georgia
                     of his indifference to the acquisition of 
                        Texas
                    , the Indiana Senator replied: "The time has now come when I should give the
                    reason why I was not so much for 
                        Texas
                    . Both 
                        Texas
                     and 
                        Oregon
                     were united in the 
                        Baltimore
                     convention. But I dreaded—if 
                        Texas
                     went first—I dreaded Punic Faith. Yes Punic faith."56
            
            Colquitt claimed, however, that Hannegan's reluctance had preceded the 
                        Baltimore
                     convention. At this point, the Senator from Indiana appealed to David R. Atchison of 
                        Missouri
                     and Ambrose H. Sevier of 
                        Arkansas
                     to verify his statements, which they did by claiming that he had been a true friend of
                    the 
                        Texas
                     annexation up until the meeting at 
                        Baltimore
                    .66
            
            The ire of Hannegan was raised in March when Senator William H. Haywood, Jr., suggested that
                    Polk's message of 1845 could be interpreted as meaning that the President stood for a
                    compromise at the forty-ninth parallel. If these were the words of the President, then he
                    "has spoken words of falsehood and with the tongue of a serpent." 
                        Texas
                     and 
                        Oregon
                    , Hannegan declared, dwelt together in the American heart. The West would not be trodden
                    on this way. After being called to order, Hannegan injected a new issue into the debate when he
                    added: "The last steamer from Europe, it is said, puts this question in such a position
                    that for 
                        Oregon
                     we can get free trade. Free trade I love dearly; but never will it be bought by me by
                    the territory of my country.… Whence this movement for free trade on the part of 
                        England
                    ? Does not every one know that she has been driven into this course by the out cries of
                    starving millions? … But the West is to be provided for; it is to have a new and most
                    profitable market. Some of us know that from the Baltic 
                        England
                     would get her wheat long before we could send a ton into her market." Thus
                    Hannegan pitted himself against the administration. During the evening of the same day that Haywood
                    made his speech, Hannegan called at the White House where from an anteroom he shouted to Polk,
                    concerning the speech of the senator from 
                        North Carolina
                    : Polk denied that any one had spoken for him on the 
                        Oregon
                     issue. Senator David L. Yulee and Dixon Lewis were in the

                     56 On March 27, 1844, after the convention at 
                                Cincinnati
                             had demanded all of 
                                Oregon
                            , the Weekly Herald and Philanthropist had predicted a bargain
                            between the South and the senatars of 
                                Ohio
                            ,

                             New Hamshire, Indiana, and probably 
                                Michigan

                             were joined at

                     next room and, according to Polk's diary, were
                    pleased with this reply.57
            
            On the next day, Polk was severely castigated by Hannegan in the Senate, and he continued to attack
                    Polk until the bill was finally passed, carrying the western Democrats, including Hannegan, Allen of 
                        Ohio
                    , James Semple of 
                        Illinois
                    , and Cass of 
                        Michigan
                    , down to defeat.
            Among the fourteen who voted against ratification on June 18, 1846, the names of Hannegan and Bright
                    are to be found. Six of the last ditch opposition were from the Northwest. Hannegan continued his
                    violent attacks even up to the ratification of the treaty, for Polk related in his diary just two
                    days before ratification occurred: "Mr. Hannegan had made a violent speech, and that
                    several of the North Western Senators were excited & in a bad Temper." These
                    "spoiled children," as Polk called them, held their grudge, and it was not until
                    the following year that Hannegan called again at the White House. "He had certainly no
                    cause for complaint against me for my course was a consistent one. I received him in a courteous
                    manner," claimed Polk.58
            
            The consistency of Polk was one matter, but to men such as Hannegan, Cass, and Allen, with their
                    uncompromising attitudes toward 
                        Oregon
                    , the expansionist urge was another. Fanatics on the subject, they would listen to no
                    compromise! Polk explained the tempest in terms of political ambition, but it was more than that.
                    Whether popular passions were whipped up by the Hoosiers themselves or by Indiana politicians in 
                        Washington
                     is not a readily answered question. There, however, seems to be little doubt that the 
                        Oregon
                     question aroused fits of temper that weakened considerably the party morale and thereby
                    caused new stress and strain on the unity of the Democracy.
            At the time when Hannegan had informed Duff Green of the trade which the West would make to get its
                    economic program, the Indiana Senator did not include the expansion issue as a part of a possible
                    political bargain. To western men of Hannegan's background, there was no compromising of
                    the best interests of all the people since manifest destiny had been clothed with sanctity. Yet when
                    the southern senators joined with the Pennsylvanians and both hurled the tariff issue into the melee
                    (for different reasons), complications arose that

                     Hannegan could not cope with. He shouted that he would not
                    sacrifice free trade for 
                        Oregon
                    , and then, in the speech already quoted, proceeded to inform the Senate that Baltic
                    wheat would arrive in Great Britain before a single bushel of American wheat could be shipped across
                    the Atlantic. At the same time, in the House, William W. Wick, also a staunch Indiana Democrat, was
                    producing statistics on the amount of western grain going directly to the continent. The wheat trade
                    was vastly important to many Hoosiers.59
            
            Hannegan, who had been in the center of the political stage in the 
                        Oregon
                     controversy, had had his moment in the limelight and was now fading into the wings. He
                    showed little interest on other western demands; for example, even during a naval appropriation bill
                    debate, he brought up 'the matter of expansion. He voiced few opinions about the tariff
                    or internal improvements. The manifest destiny of the growing nation had provided him opportunity to
                    exhibit his political forte—oratory. He was a blustery and often brilliant speaker. An
                    English woman who visited the Senate galleries described him as a "genuine son of the West;
                    ardent, impulsive and undaunted; thinking, acting and daring with the most perfect freedom. His
                    spirit is youthful and buoyant, and he is ever sanguine of success, though he feels acutely the
                    bitterness of disappointment." She went on to say that the Indiana Senator possessed the
                    characteristics of his western colleagues who were "fluent of speech, quick in action, and
                    ready in expedients; they are, in fact, the very men required for the posttion they hold, that of
                    Borderers of the Republic. They are a new power, whose interests, although inseparably blended with
                    those of the other sections of the Union, are yet distinct and individual; the West but now begins
                    to assert herself, to exhibit her strength, and though yet an infant, to claim her share in the
                    'balance of power.' "60
            
            Hannegan was far from being a careful and calculating statesman; rather he was a politician who
                    allowed himself to be carried away by his own eloquence. His vehemence and bluster were born of
                    debate rather than of a long planned course of political action. Typical of a stump speaker who
                    never yielded ground to his opponent, Hannegan obstinately defended any position he took. His
                    impetuousness led him to say many things that he later regretted. In the 
                        Oregon
                     controversy, his course against Polk and the bargain he made may

                     well have occurred to him on the floor of the Senate, for they
                    came spontaneously and in extemporaneous remarks. His hurried visits to Polk at the White House were
                    in the heat of anger. To brush aside the wheat trade of the West was certainly not a calculated
                    move. In the course of senatorial debates, he was rather frequently called to order by the president
                    of the Senate. On occasion, his heated flow of words made later apologies necessary. After one of
                    these occurrences in the Senate, the Indiana politician offered an explanation for his impetuous
                    manner] "His [John Fairfield] language was meant in kindness…. It implies,
                    simply, that I act without reflection —that I press forward without
                    consideration—that I have no consultation with patience. That, sir, can be implied only
                    from the ardor of my manner, which God gave me, and which I did not bestow upon myself. I have on
                    one or two occasions been taken to task here for this ardor of manner. Let me, once for all, say,
                    look at the language—look not at the manner. Who is there that can say to me, you have
                    planted a thorn, or thrust with a dagger? Is there malice in me? If my manner be warm, I cannot help
                    it. If it be a crime and an offence to carry a warm heart—and although I say it
                    myself—an honest one, then am I subject to the reproach….But, sir, I, at least
                    am incapable of smiling when I stab."61 The ever hasty Hannegan was
                    susceptüble to excesses all of his life. His legal career was eventually ruined by his
                    drinking habits. Contrasted to him was Stephen A. Douglas who, although also thoroughly aroused by
                    the 
                        Oregon
                     squabble, continued to climb the political ladder. The 
                        Illinois
                     Senator had more than oratorical skill and while he, too, was unpredictable, he was a
                    manager, which Hannegan was not.62 In the 
                        Oregon
                     debates, Hannegan's haranguing and distrust of the other sectional wings of
                    the Democracy heJped to widen the cracks in the already over-strained seams that were holding the
                    diverging interests together.
            The final result of this phase of the developing sectional strife was that one of the western
                    demands—54° 40—was lost.
            While still smarting from this defeat, the Hoosier politicians had little time to regain their pose
                    for there were other battles to be fought and won if the western program was to become an actuality.
                    Sectional issues that posed no easy compromise included the tariff, internal improvements, and
                    slavery.

            The Moravian Records
            
                    Paul A. W. Wallace*
               
                
            One of the most promising sources for the study of the Indians of the Middle West and the Middle
                    Atlantic States is the body of records left by early missionaries of the Unitas
                    Fratrum or Moravian church, who worked among the retreating tribes before their culture was
                    submerged by that of the white man. A few of these Moravian records have already been printed,
                    notably the White River Diaries, translations of which were published by the Indiana Historical
                    Bureau in 1938 under the editorship of Lawrence H. Gipson; but the great bulk of them remains in
                    manuscript at the Moravian Archives in 
                        Bethlehem
                    , 
                        Pennsylvania
                    .
            There are many other repositories of Moravian records in America, but the 
                        Bethlehem
                     collection is by far the largest and the most important. Bishop Samuel H. Gapp, the
                    archivist, explained it in this way: "
                        Bethlehem
                     was the headquarters for all the Moravian missions in the New World, from 
                        Greenland
                     to 
                        Surinam
                    , including the West Indies and the North American continent." From all
                    stations throughout this huge area, reports in the form of diaries were sent to headquarters; and
                    there, in 
                        Bethlehem
                    , a specially trained Schreiber Collegium or corps of secretaries, who
                    had no other business than to write, sent out such copies of these reports as might be of interest
                    to other centers of this great missionary church: to their international headquarters at Herrnhut in
                    Saxony; to the English headquarters in 
                        London
                    ; to Nazareth, 
                        Lititz
                    , and other stations in 
                        Pennsylvania
                    ; to stations in 
                        Maryland
                    , 
                        North Carolina
                    , 
                        Ohio
                    , Indiana, Upper 
                        Canada
                    , and so on. But the central repository on this side of the ocean has always been 
                        Bethlehem
                    , where the original reports are still to be found.
            For the worker in the field of American ethnohistory, these records are an essential primary source.
                    They contain untold riches for the discriminating student. But anyone who approaches them without
                    understanding their character and

                    records, and to suggest some ways in which they may most profitably be used.
            It has been my privilege recently to spend some time among them, working in the beautiful archives
                    building on the campus of Moravian College. Thanks to Bishop Kenneth G. Hamilton, chairman of the
                    archives committee, and to the archivist, Bishop Samuel H. Gapp, I have been given the opportunity
                    of going through all the famous "green boxes" of the Indian Department. My primary
                    purpose was to search for journals and letters written by John Heckewelder, who in 1754, at the age
                    of eleven, came from 
                        England
                     to America, and who, between the year 1762 (when he had his introduction to missionary
                    work by going out with Christian Frederick Post to the Muskingum) and his retirement some fifty
                    years later, journeyed over twenty-six thousand miles through the woods of 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , 
                        Ohio
                    , 
                        Michigan
                    , Indiana, and southwestern Ontario in the service of Indian missions.
            While I was engaged in this search for Heckewelder materials, I kept my eyes open for other things;
                    and, with Bishop Gapp's very generous and understanding assistance, I was able to get a
                    pretty good view of the whole breathtaking collection. My own earlier studies of colonial and Indian
                    figures had made me alert to the significance of many of the documents handled. I found in these
                    pages intimate references to Indians with whom I had already some acquaintance, and clues to riddles
                    that had bothered scholars for a long time past. I mention this personal experience because, in what
                    follows, I want you to know that I am not reporting from hearsay, and also that I am not altogether
                    talking through my hat.
            To understand what kind of value the Moravian records have for the ethnohistorian, it is necessary to
                    know first what went into their making, in other words to know something about the purpose and
                    history of the mission under whose auspices these records were made. That is essential, not
                    primarily because it explains the wide geographical area from which the records came, but rather
                    because a study of the motives animating the missionaries will explain the kind of contact they had
                    both with individual Indians inside the mission community, and with the Indian nations outside it,
                    on whose territories the mission had found domicile.
            
            It is an unusual story. If you want it in full, read DeCost Smith's Martyrs
                        of the Oblong and Little Nine.1 Here, I can give you only a glimpse of
                    it, but perhaps enough to serve the present purpose.
            In the year 1740, one of the Moravian Brethren, Christian Henry Rauch, established a mission among
                    the Mahican at Shekomeko and Wechquadnach in the Province of 
                        New York
                     on the borders of 
                        Connecticut
                    . The first convert was "Tschoop" (Job), a wretched creature who was
                    said to look more like a bear than a man, misshapen, wild, drunken, product of a time of frustration
                    when his people found themselves made outcasts in their own country by white men who seized their
                    land and gave them in return a contempt that beat on the Indian's brain until it seemed
                    as if it would crush it.
            Tschoop's conversion had something dramatic and a trifle strident about it. "I am
                    a poor wild heathen," he confessed in a letter to Count Zinzendorf, renouncing the worship
                    of his mother-in-law's idol, which he stated was "made of leather in the shape
                    of a man and adorned with wampum."2 But the conversion of Tschoop was
                    genuine—complete and permanent. This success, and others like it, encouraged the
                    Moravians to believe that their method of evangelism, which was aimed at changing the whole man,
                    educating him, teaching him arts and crafts, restoring his self-respect, and so enabling him to make
                    the transition from old ways to new without the disintegration of his personality—that
                    this method gave the best promise for a solution of the whole displaced-persons problem which the
                    white man's conquest of this continent was precipitating. The Moravians had hopes of the
                    regeneration, by their method, not merely of a few individuals like Tschoop of Shekomeko and Joshua
                    of Wechquadnach, but of whole communities, of nations, eventually of the whole Indian race. Count
                    Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf, the originating genius of these Indian missions, dreamed at one time
                    of a Christian Indian state—not alien to but under the aegis of the Province of 
                        Pennsylvania
                    .
            To this great end, the saving of the Indian people from the mass degradation to which the rum trader

                     the Moravians turned their energies. They not only preached to
                    the Indians, but lived with them, working with them in the fields, accompanying them to the woods
                    for "sugar boiling," and imparting to them their own crafts and
                    skills—for these missionaries worked without salary, living, as the Indians did, by what
                    they produced with their own hands. They taught their converts to read and write, to work at trades.
                    Joshua of Wechquadnach became a cooper. Martha became a mantua maker. The missionaries did not
                    regard the saving of souls as a mere matter of baptism, of correct answers to catechism, or even of
                    confession of faith. It was a matter of Christian living —a thing which is caught, if at
                    all, by contagion, from the people one lives with.
            It was a noble experiment, but the times were against it. War with the French in 
                        Canada
                     filled these border areas, during the mid-1740's, with the fears and
                    suspicions too readily entertained at any time of people with a strange speech and a different
                    color. Persecution of the missionaries and their flock soon brought an end to the 
                        New York
                     mission. The Moravians would not, however, forsake the "little Congregation of
                    Brown Hearts," as they called their Indian brethren. They brought them, accordingly, to 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , hoping that the enlightened religious and racial policies of the Penns would there
                    assure them freedom and protection.
            A promising mission community was established on the Lehigh River at the mouth of Mahoning Oreek.
                    This was Gnadenhutten, "Tents of Grace," a name that recurs constantly in the
                    story of the mission. But the life of this first Gnadenhutten was short. During the French and
                    Indian War it was destroyed by enemy Indians, and a number of the missionaries there were killed. A
                    new beginning was made a few years later, at the close of Pontiac's War, at a place
                    called Wyalusing on the North Branch of the Susquehanna River. The 
                        Delaware
                     chief, John Papunhank, was the first convert here. By this time the mission had grown
                    considerably through the addition of many 
                        Delaware
                     to the original Mahican band. At Wyalusing, Mahican and 
                        Delaware
                     together built a good-sized town, the houses for the most part of squared logs, with
                    gardens, fences, orchards, and streets swept every Saturday with housewives' brooms in
                    preparation for the Sabbath. There Joshua, who had a house, garden, and stable, worked at his
                    cooper's trade and played the spineh—ne that he had made with his own hands,
                    under instruction from his Moravian  teachers. In later years,
                    out west, when the mission had acquired an organ, he became the organist and leader of the church
                    choir. Meantime, travelers up the Susquehanna were amazed at the neatness of Friedenshutten and its
                    air of happy industry.
            Another mission was established a few miles north at the Indian town of Sheshequin. This place was
                    close to the great Indian center of Tioga, where trails converged from all parts of the Six Nations
                    country. The missionaries here, in consequence, found themselves in touch with the great world of
                    Indian affairs. On occasion they received embassies, as did also Wyalusing, from Indian nations in
                    the north and in the west.
            But up out of the nearby Wyoming Valley, where 
                        Connecticut
                     Yankees and Pennamites found it difficult to agree on which of them owned the land
                    taken from the Indian, came sounds of strife. Soon the contestants themselves appeared, armed with
                    liquor and driven by land fever.3 Just when the situation was becoming
                    impossible for the mission, something occurred that changed the whole outlook and brought alive
                    again the hope that these bands of mission Indians might, by their example, work the transformation
                    of the whole Indian race.
            It seems that out on the headwaters of the Muskingum, on what is now called the Tuscarawas River in 
                        Ohio
                    , the 
                        Delaware
                     Council at Gekelemukpechunk of whom the forward-looking Netawatwees was the head, had
                    been keeping itself informed of the progress made by the Christian Indians at Wyalusing in adopting
                    the white man's ways without losing their own identity. The Great Council now decided to
                    invite these Moravian Indians to come west and show by example how the transition from old customs
                    to new could safely be made. Netawatwees was convinced that these Christian Indians had found the
                    best way to ride the "wave of the future."
            The Council sent official invitations to Wyalusing and Sheshequin, first by the prophet Wangomen and
                    afterward by Chief Killbuck4—both important men in the history of the
                    West. Accompanying the invitation was an offer to set aside for the newcomers a large tract of good
                    land on the Muskingum, where they could have better farms and build better towns than any they had
                    hitherto known.

            The invitation was accepted. Bishop John Ettwein led his band of over two hundred 
                        Delaware
                     and Mahican, men, women, and children, with their cattle, household goods, and family
                    pets, across the Susquehanna River and out over the Wyalusing Path to Muncy, then by the Great
                    Shamokin Path to Kittanning on the Allegheny, and thence to Friedenstadt (City of Peace) on Beaver
                    Creek, where they remained for a few months before going on to the Muskingum. There they found, as
                    the 
                        Delaware
                     Council had promised, a thirty-mile stretch of land along the river below
                    Gekelemukpechünk made ready for them by the evacuation of Indian families and even of two
                    small Indian towns.5
            
            Hitherto the Moravian missionaries, whose faithfully-kept diaries form the bulk of the records here
                    discussed, had had only incidental contact with Indians outside their mission—as, for
                    instance, in 1753 when a Band of Nanticoke about to migrate to the Six Nations country, invited the
                    Christian Indians to take their place as guardians of the Wyoming Valley, an invitation the converts
                    Teedyuscung (later known as "King of the 
                        Delaware
                    ") and the Mahican Abraham accepted, with considerable impact on colonial
                    history. But from now on, that is to say, from the year 1772 when the mission built its first towns,
                    Schonbrunn (near the present New 
                        Philadelphia
                    ) and a second Gnadenhutten, the Moravians found themselves in the very vortex of Indian
                    politics. Not that they wished to take a direct part in these matters, but the winds of
                    international diplomacy blew strongly through their settlement. The diaries contain frequent reports
                    of embassies passing through their towns from north, west, and south. In reading these documents
                    today, one becomes aware of "cold wars" and political cross currents almost as
                    confusing in the woods of 
                        Ohio
                     and Indiana as those one hears of today in Europe and Asia. Though this gave the
                    missionaries unparalleled opportunities to observe the high world of Indian diplomacy and
                    statecraft, it also entailed involvements which in the end wrecked the settlement. When war came,
                    they found themselves actually straddling Indian warpaths.
            At the outbreak of the Revolution, the Moravians of both races tried to preserve an official
                    neutrality, though their sympathies were with the Americans. What influence they had at

                     Indian council fires in the West was exerted for peace, a
                    policy entirely in line with American tactics. 
                        Delaware
                     councils at this time were divided. Netawatwees, a good friend of the Moravians, died
                    in 
                        Pittsburgh
                    , October, 31, 1776, urging, as his last will and testament, that the Christian Gospel
                    be taught to his people. Captain White Eyes and Chief Killbuck, followers of Netawatwees and friends
                    to the Americans, were for keeping the borders quiet. Captain Pipe, on the other hand, a 
                        Delaware
                     War Chief who feared the Long Knives' land hunger, wanted to join the
                    British and go to war. In the end, Captain Pipe and his followers painted their faces black, crossed
                    the Muskingum, and headed east to attack the American settlements.
            This was more than John Heckewelder, who was one of the founders of Gnadenhiitten, could stand. In
                    order to prevent the shedding of blood, he sent repeated warnings to the American commander at 
                        Pittsburgh
                    , specifying the complexion and numbers of enemy war parties, and expressing the hope
                    that they would "get what they deserved."6
            
            On March 30, 1780, Heckewelder wrote to Colonel Daniel Brodhead: 
                  
                     
                        "We have heard nothing at all… this whole winter, what the enemy
                                    are about. The snows being so deep and the weather so continually cold has I suppose
                                    prevented this, but this day I am informed that three young fellows, two Dela-wares
                                    and one Wyandott, have turned back from a body of warriors consisting of twenty six
                                    men. They inform, that five or six companies of warriors have gone out, two parties
                                    of Wyandotts towards Beaver Creek and the others down this river. The Half-King it
                                    appears is at 'the head of one of the parties and Nees haw& (a

                                    Indians as were in their vicinity, which frequently enabled me to counteract them by

                                    every possible means to dissuade the Indians from War with the people of America and

            Captain Pipe was no fool. He was soon aware that John Heckewelder, as a consequence of the
                    information sent to Pithburgh, was causing the death of his warriors. Communicating with the British
                    in 
                        Detroit
                    , he was authorized to seize the missionaries and bring them, with their flock, north to
                    Lake 
                        Erie
                    , where they would, as the British saw it, be in no position to do further mischief.
                    John Heckewelder's narrative of his captivity and of the journey made in the fall of the
                    year with his wife and baby daughter, Polly, to Upper Sandusky10 gives a picture
                    of "wild" Indians from a somewhat unusual angle—for example, the 
                        Ottawa
                     warrior who dressed himself up in stolen missionary clothes, and rode about camp with a
                    nightcap on his head. At Captives Town, as the new missionary settlement at Upper Sandusky came to
                    be called, the Brethren built themselves houses and tried to keep alive during a winter of famine.
            When the missionaries were summoned to 
                        Detroit
                    , to be examined before Major Arent S. de Peyster, the British commandant, there
                    occurred one of those odd reversals that make history stranger than fiction. Captain Pipe, who, with
                    his warriors on their arrival at 
                        Detroit
                     had marched up the street to the government house shouting the "death
                    hallo," turned out to be a man of quixote magnanimity. He could be cruel, on provocation,
                    but what he had recently seen of these Moravian teachers did not stir up that element in his nature.
                    He knew as well as Netawatwees had known that, in the long run, the Moravian influence was good for
                    his people. When the British Commandant called on Captain Pipe to present his charges against the
                    prisoners, the chief declined to make any. "These are good men," he said.
                    "I would be sorry to see them ill-treated." The major, accordingly, dropped the
                    case and set the missionaries free—with a gentle admonition henceforth to leave war
                    matters alone.
            Meantime certain of the American borderers, unaware of the help the Moravians and their Indians had
                    been giving to the American cause, were working up to the hysterical outburst which was to bring so
                    much shame upon them. Early in the spring of 1782, a considerable part of the half-starved mission
                    Indians at Captives Town returned to Gnadenhutten on

                            Archives, contains much detail not found in the printed version.
               
                     the Muskingum to gather what they could find of last
                    year's corn. There, in the fields, a band of militia under a certain Colonel David
                    Williamson found them. Approaching them with professions of friendship, the militia took them
                    prisoners, herded them into two houses (one of which was Joshua's cooper shop), and there
                    hacked and clubbed these unarmed people —over a third of whom were children—to
                    death, using as tools for this purpose axes, knives, and Joshua's cooper's
                    mallet. Joshua himself was absent at the time (he was to die later at the hands of the Shawnee in
                    Indiana), but his two daughters, fourteen and eighteen years old, were murdered.11
            
            "Often, very often," wrote Heckewelder afterward, "has he been seen
                    shedding tears, on this account, though he was never heard to utter a revengeful sentiment against
                    the murderers: he however could not conceal his astonishment, that a people, who called themselves
                    Christians, and read the scriptures, which he supposed all white people did, could commit such acts
                    of barbarity."12
            
            Gnadenhutten is still there, a beautiful little modern town that has done what it can to wipe out the
                    stain of the massacre. A tall stone shaft raised beside the grave of these martyrs is inscribed with
                    the words: "Here triumphed in death ninety Christian Indians March 8 1782."
            One is reminded of the inscription of an Indian burial mound at Cooperstown, 
                        New York
                    : "White man, greeting! We near whose bones you stand were Iroquois. The wide
                    land which now is yours was ours. Friendly hands have given back to us enough for a tomb."
            The massacre at Gnadenhiitten did not end the mission, though it caused the defection of a few of the
                    Indians—more through revulsion than fear—and darkened the hopes of the
                    missionaries. It became a came célèbre, among Indians as
                    well as among white men. General George 
                        Washington
                    , hearing of what had happened at Gnadenhiitten, instructed commanders in the West to
                    warn their men not to allow themselves to fall alive into Indian hands, since now they could expect
                    no mercy.13 When Williamson, this time under the command of

                     Colonel William Crawford, came out with a force of five hundred
                    men against Upper Sandusky, he found Captives Town deserted. But in the neighborhood were Captain
                    Pipe and his warriors, prepared to take, not prisoners this time, but scalps. Williamson fled and
                    escaped, leaving Crawford, who could not keep up with him, to his fate. Crawford was taken prisoner
                    and tortured on orders from Captain Pipe, not for anything he had done himself but because he had
                    been out with Williamson.
            For many years after that, the Moravian mission, now often described in the diaries as the
                    "wandering congregation," was buffeted about by the winds of politics and war.
                    Under the Shawnee, Tecumseh, and his brother, the Prophet, a fierce nativist movement sprang up
                    which reversed Netawat-wees' policy of conciliation and compromise, and put the Moravians
                    high on the list of those who must be liquidated. In 1806, Joshua the cooper, organist, and
                    choirmaster, formerly of Gnadenhiitten and now a "chapel interpreter" in the White
                    River mission, was burned at the stake. Horizons narrowed for the Moravians. Their former high hopes
                    were lost in a struggle for bare survival. David Zeisberger died believing the mission to have
                    failed. During the twenty-six years he had lived since the massacre at Gnadenhiitten on the
                    Muskingum, he had seen his flock driven from one place to another: from Captives Town to New
                    Gnadenhutten in 
                        Michigan
                    , Pilgerruh (Pilgrim's Rest) on the Cuyahoga, 
                        New Salem
                     on the Pett-quotting, die Warte (the Watch Tower) on the 
                        Detroit
                     River, and finally to 
                        Fairfield
                     (more popularly known as Moravian-town) near the country of the Chippewa in Upper 
                        Canada
                    . In this last place, a few miles east of 
                        Detroit
                    , it remained for some time in quiet. But, during the War of 1812, the congregation
                    again found itself in the path of armies. Always the flaming sword between them and the City of
                    Peace! Before the Battle of Moraviantown, British forces occupied the town. After the battle,
                    General William H. Harrison's victorious soldiers sacked and burned it.
            But this time the congregation did not wander. A quarter of a mile away, across the Thomas River,
                    they built a new 
                        Fairfield
                    . And there you may see to this day what remains of the Shekomeko mission: some two
                    hundred 
                        Delaware
                    —they have almost forgotten their Mahican blood, though some of the old
                    Mahican baptismal names still run in their families—a good-living, industrious people,
                    commuters who work in neighboring towns but who, under Chief Omer Peters (as delightful  a gentleman as you will find to talk with in a day's drive)
                    have preserved their own identity as Indians. Though they are members of the United Church of 
                        Canada
                    , they honor the memory of the Moravian Brethren who led their ancestors here nearly one
                    hundred sixty years ago. Visit them, if you wish to see a living monument to one of the noblest
                    experiments ever made in the furtherance of race understanding.
            It will be seen from this brief sketch of the mission what opportunities the Moravians had for
                    observing the Indian world before its collapse. What use they made of these opportunities we have
                    now to consider.
            The Moravians had an educated ministry, and their church leaders pursued an enlightened evangelical
                    policy. Theirs was not the "baptize and run" type of evangelism—count
                    souls saved and call it a day. On the contrary, the evangelistic work was only part of a sound
                    educational policy aimed at the good life, the all-around development of their converts. Such a
                    policy required that the Moravian teachers should live and work with their people, and understand
                    their personal problems.
            The missionaries who made the records we are surveying were an intelligent, well-balanced,
                    well-informed group. Their eyes were not exclusively turned inward. They were interested in all that
                    went on around them. Not infrequently they were employed by the government to serve as advisers at
                    Indian treaties, or, as in the case of Christian Frederick Post, to undertake dangerous
                    ambassadorial assignments. Post, in the 
                        Ohio
                     country in 1758, was sold by Daniel, a 
                        Delaware
                    , to the French for value received. Daniel failed to deliver the goods only because Post
                    had sat at Pisquetomen's fire, and the laws of hospitality (as this brother of King
                    Beaver understood them) could not be broken to surrender him. Missionaries such as this were not
                    overburdened by the minutiae of doctrine and discipline. When they met Indians, it
                    was not the nonessential things about them that they observed. They were not looking for oddities to
                    tickle the fancy of metropolitan audiences. Their appraisal of the Indians had regard to their
                    essential humanity.
            We find in the reports from the missionaries, and in the other records at 
                        Bethlehem
                    , a wide range of material. In attempting any analysis of these Archives, we must note
                    to begin with that the core of the collection is the 
                        Bethlehem
                     Diary, the record kept by the authorities at headquarters. Its forty-four  fat manuscript volumes contain not only the local news of 
                        Bethlehem
                     and its vicinity, but also news of all the other activities in which these wide-awake
                    people were interested. There is news here of government doings in 
                        Philadelphia
                     and other capitals, news of the frontier—church news and Indian news.
                    Extracts are given from travelers' letters. David Zeisberger's journey from 
                        Bethlehem
                     to Goschgoschink on the Allegheny can be almost as clearly followed in the 
                        Bethlehem
                     Diary as in his own journals. The 
                        Bethlehem
                     Diary depicts, not only the new missions of a very old church (one which had originated
                    among the followers of John Huss in the fifteenth century), but also the expansion of a very young
                    nation into the as-yet-unwelcoming West.
            But the section of the Moravian records which is of chief concern to us here is the one known as the
                    Indian Department, which has been just recently taken out of the old green boxes, reorganized, and
                    rearranged for greater convenience to the student. It is here that the ethnohistorian finds his
                    Golconda. Some time ago I stumbled on the original pages (scattered through three separate boxes) of
                    Christian Frederick Post's 1758 journal to Venango, describing the journey that cost 
                        France
                     her Indian allies on the 
                        Ohio
                     and so cleared the way for General John Forbes at Fort Duquesne. These fragments were
                    without title page or signature, but they were unmistakably Post's to anyone familiar
                    with his handwriting, incredible spelling, and style. Since I was at the time making a study of
                    Indian trails, this, the first version of his badly printed diary, was to me the Great Mogul. It
                    explained discrepancies in the printed journal and cleared up the uncertainty with regard to his
                    route. Further assistance from Bishop Gapp, whose profound knowledge of church history is matched by
                    an acute understanding of a wide range of subjects pertinent to this inquiry, including the
                    peculiarities of 
                        German
                     idiom and the habits of cows on the march, cleared up what remained of the Forbidden
                    Path mystery. Everywhere in these papers are traces of Indian personages who, after a brief
                    appearance on the pages of state records, had disappeared from official view. Jo Peepy, for
                    instance, a 
                        Delaware
                     stalwart among David Brainerd's Presbyterians in eastern 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , turns up in the Moravian records as an aged interpreter who accompanied the Moravians
                    when they journeyed to the Muskingum in 1772, and, a year later, as the Fremden
                    Diener or official receptionist at Gnadenhutten who got a meal ready for a certain  Mahican with his wife and daughter when they came on a visit from
                    Eckpalawehunt's Town.14 Jo Peepy's wife, Hannah, was one
                    of those murdered at Gnadenhiitten.15
            
            If you are interested in Indian biographies, after having exhausted the government records, try the
                    Moravian Archives. Go first, if the man you are interested in was a Christian, to the list of 721
                    Indians baptized up to the year 1772, a list that notes, wherever possible, the man's or
                    woman's name (Indian name and baptismal name), family relationships, tribe, place and
                    time of baptism and who performed the ceremony, place and time of death. Then look him up in the
                    Moravian obituaries, which are preserved in a section by themselves. Look for him also in the lists
                    of communicants, and the separate records of baptisms, births, marriages, and deaths. Finally, look
                    for him in the diaries of those missions where he may have lived, or, if he was not a Christian,
                    where he is most likely to have paid a visit or in some way to have made his influence felt. Strings
                    of wampum were being constantly delivered at one or another of the mission stations, and the
                    messages that accompanied them from this or that chief are carefully recorded. Netawatwees and
                    Packandgihille; Captain Pipe and Captain White Eyes; King Beaver; Joseph Brant; Pamoacan, the
                    Wy-andot Half King; Tobias, the Indian boy who slipped into the cellar and so escaped the carnage at
                    Gnadenhutten, though the blood of his kin leaked between boards in the floor above his head and
                    splashed on his face and hands; Head Chief Tete-pachsit, who invited the Moravians to come to the
                    White River; Chief Little Turtle of the Miami; the Shawnee prophet, —they are all here
                    and many more, men who played a part in the history of the West, only waiting to be brought alive
                    again out of the pages of these Moravian records.
            There are some interesting unpublished linguistic materials at 
                        Bethlehem
                    ; scraps of early Mahican vocabularies; a few letters, such as that signed by Abraham,
                    January 2, 1752, with a 
                        German
                     translation appended. The greatest of Moravian linguists, of course, was Zeisberger.
                    The manuscript of his Indian dictionary is here; others of his manuscripts are in the 
                        Harvard
                     College Library. John Heckewelder's linguistic work is for the most part in
                    the Library of the American Philosophical Society in 
                        Philadelphia

                     are not without interest to specialists. There are seven pages of Indian verses with an
                    interlinear translation in 
                        German
                    . There is a note concerning the johah—the Iroquois cry of
                    approbation which so much interested Conrad Weiser and Henry Melchior Muhlenberg—giving
                    its equivalent in the Shawnee, 
                        Delaware
                    , and Mahican languages.
            The mission diaries, already mentioned as a source for biographical information, have much else
                    besides for the ethnohistorian. Along with the routine news contained in them, are what we might
                    call "angling shots" of the Indians at their daily chores: "sugar
                    boiling," farming, even hunting (for only the fruits of the chase could be exchanged for
                    the traders' goods the Indian stood in need of), the reception of embassies from the Six
                    Nations country, the 
                        Wabash
                    , the White River, the Miami, or the 
                        Mississippi
                    .
            A diary from Shamokin at the Forks of the Susquehanna (the present Sunbury) pictures some canoe loads
                    of Iroquois warriors stopping off for the night, and, in return for the hospitality received,
                    putting on a war dance for their hosts. The sound of the drum, the flashing of drawn swords in their
                    hands, and the movement of their bodies—not the naked torsos of magazine illustrations,
                    but all clad in brown coats trimmed with gold lace16—these make a
                    colorful and surprisingly modern scene in which the Indians appear more like "gentlemen
                    adventurers" than like the savages of conventional fiction.
            One curious journal, kept during the period of wanderings in the West, is headed, "Diary of
                    the Indian Congregation in Night's-Lodging on the Cayahoga." The dates are
                    October, 1786, to February, 1787—surely a long night for this latitude. But
                    "night's-lodging" is a familiar Indian metaphor, meaning a visit of a
                    year—or, it may be, of indefinite duration. The Seneca of 
                        New York
                     State, on whose lands at Lewiston the Tuscarora have settled permanently, crack this
                    joke about their guests: "The Tuscaroras asked if they might stop overnight; and now they
                    remain to itch us like fleas." The Cayuga on the Six Nations Reserve in 
                        Canada
                    , among whom the descendants of Teedyuscung's 
                        Delaware
                     from the Wyoming Valley have found asylum, put it this way: "The Delawares
                    asked if they might stay overnight; but morning never came."

                     violence or of primitive absurdities (like the use of emetics
                    to clean out sin), than with the unexpected appositeness of their conditions to ours. From the 
                        Goshen
                     Diary of December 1, 1799, for instance, one learns of an early attempt to stop
                    inflation by means of price fixing in the meat industry: "The price as fixed by Br.
                    Heckewelder before his departure for 
                        Bethlehem
                     is 1 penny a lb. for the best joints, or a dollar for a whole deer, without the skin.
                    In summer, when the deer were lean, they were sold for 3/9 each. Bear's meat is 3 pence
                    per lb. or 6 pence for the fat only." If the price of fat in this list seems excessive, we
                    must remember that bear's fat ms used for cosmetics. And if that seems outlandish, may I
                    remind you we use skunk as a base for perfumes.
            It is from the 
                        Goshen
                     Diary also that we learn of the prevalence of bad colds among Indian children in
                    February, for the reason that, during what the diarist calls "thaw weather," it
                    was impossible for them to go out of doors without "getting wet feet through their porous
                    moccasins." Besides, these youngsters had a habit of breaking through the soft ice on the
                    river, which they would try to cross, too late in the season.
            The Moravian diaries are buzzing with movement. In their pages, one finds the primeval American
                    forest, which it is now conventional to think of as an all-but-unbroken solitude, teeming with life
                    like a ripe cheese. We are made to realize that the Indians were great travelers. Their woods were
                    honeycombed with trails over which they sped on all manner of businesses: hunters combing the
                    valleys by day in search of game, and, in the evening, still full of high spirits, peeling the bark
                    off trees and on the bare spot thus exposed painting their exploits; runners giving the alarm yell
                    as they approached each town to assemble the people; warriors uttering their triumphant scalp cry as
                    they returned from an expedition; chiefs with their retinue bearing peace pipes and wampum for
                    distant council fires; or, as happened each year among the Chippewa, whole communities traveling
                    north to escape the September fever.
            The travel journals, of which there are many, are among the best things in the whole collection; for
                    these missionary travelers, freed while on the trail from the routine of conventional duties, had
                    time to look around them. Fresh scenes and new contacts put life and dash into their style. Nowhere
                    will you find vivider or more honest sketches of our westward 
                    moving frontier, during the transition period when the lands of 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , 
                        Ohio
                    , and Indiana were occupied jointly by white men and brown. In these pages you will see
                    the white man and the Indian at his best and at his worst.
            In John Heckewelder's journals you may read of Indians killing one another in drunken
                    brawls, and of white men in the taverns tearing at one another until the skin of their hands hung
                    down in tatters. From Heckewelder, however, you will learn more of the pleasures than of the
                    discomforts of pioneer travel. He, like most of the Moravians, who had a strong vein of the
                    artistic, had a taste for wild scenery, whether among the mountains or on the plains, long before
                    the romantic poets had made such landscapes fashionable. He was entranced by the extent of hills
                    spread out below him as he looked down from the summit of the Allegheny Mountains west of 
                        Bedford
                    . He was equally delighted with the "majesty" of Indiana's
                    Lombardy poplars, "under whose shadow," as he wrote, "the buffaloes hide
                    from the summer sun." He wrote with enthusiasm about the "beautiful 
                        Wabash
                     river," where it "proudly empties into the 
                        Ohio
                    ."
            In 1792 Heckewelder accompanied General Rufus 
                        Putnam
                    , as an adviser to the Indian conference at 
                        Vincennes
                    ,17 where, he said, "articles of peace were formally signed
                    by thirty-one chiefs of the Seven Nations represented at this meeting." Traveling by boat
                    down the 
                        Ohio
                    , he was amazed to see the "almost continuous" herds of buffalo along
                    the bank. His description of the Indians at the conference, though vivid, is disappointingly
                    scrappy; but he makes up for this by an excited description of the country around, which he declared
                    to be the best he had ever seen. "It may be said of the meadows of this country,"
                    he wrote, "that some of them are several days journey in length." They served then
                    chiefly for the grazing of buffalo herds.
            On his way west, he had skirted Indiana by way of the 
                        Ohio
                     and the 
                        Wabash
                    ; but on his return he crossed its territory, traveling from 
                        Vincennes
                     overland to the Falls of the 
                        Ohio
                    . He and his party, after leaving behind them the "beautiful White
                    River," found themselves in a wilderness "where," as he said,
                    "we could with difficulty pass through the grape 
                  
                     17 "Narrative of John Heckewelder's Journey to the

                     vines and bushes." At the 
                        Buffalo
                     Salt Lick, he said, as many as five hundred buffalo sometimes could be seen all at
                    once. "The salt spot," he continued, "several acres in size, is so much
                    trodden down and grubbed up, that not a blade of grass can grow and the entire woods are for miles
                    around quite bare. Many heads and skeletons of these animals are to be found which were either shot
                    from time to time, or had died there. From here a great many buffalo trails lead out, and we had the
                    misfortune to take such an one instead of the right one, our guides not being with us, but when they
                    came back again, they led us in to the right path."
            If one were looking for oddities in these Moravian journals, one would certainly not want to miss the
                    glimpses there given of medical practice on the trail. The best way to treat a bruise, Heckewelder
                    learned from a white woman who attended to him after his horse had stepped on his foot while he was
                    groping in the dark for his hat which a low branch had knocked off his head, was to apply old wagon
                    grease as it ran off the wheel hub. Not having any handy, she applied a tar plaster to his foot,
                    which healed him in no time. For earache, he noted (apparently from the same medical authority) a
                    good remedy was the vapor of red sumac boiled in water.18
            
            Of a cure for spider bites, this is what he learned one day in October, 1786, on his way east from
                    the Muskingum: "Early on the 13th," he wrote, one of the Indians "while
                    driving in the horses was so badly poisoned by a spider that he gave us to understand he must die.
                    In a very few minutes his eyes were swollen shut, and his whole body covered with large red spots.
                    He pointed to his heart, which, as he told us afterward, felt as if it were under a heavy weight or
                    in a press. John Cook [an Indian] who had gone through this same experience twice in his life
                    before, made him drink a concoction of gunpowder, tobacco, and rotten leaves, the same being also
                    rubbed over him. At once he began to vomit, and after an hour we could see he was recovering.
                    … By ten o'clock he told us to break camp. We put him on a horse and set
                        off."19
            
            By this time we have seen enough of the Moravian missionaries, their opportunity to observe the
                    Indian, and the use they made of it, to be ready for the main question, which is

                    to those, that is, who are engaged in Indian studies? Granted the scraps of linguistic material, the
                    picturesque travel journals, the reports of Indian conferences (some of which have not found their
                    way into government records); granted the new light thrown on trails and on Indian biographies, the
                    question still remains: how solid and impressive a contribution do these records make to the highly
                    specialized and well-developed modern science of anthropology? How important, for instance, are the
                    Moravian studies of Indian religion, of council ritual, of medicine societies?
            The question, so narrowed, has only one honest answer. Of formal ethnological studies, the Moravian
                    records at 
                        Bethlehem
                     have little to offer. Zeisberger and Heckewelder did valuable linguistic work, but,
                    when they attempted to enter the field of ethnology, their contribution is disappointing.
            Heckewelder, it is true, in his retirement wrote and published an ambitious book entitled the History, Manners and Customs of the Indian Nations Who Once Inhabited 
                            Pennsylvania
                         and the Neighboring States—but that is not the work for which we
                    have chief reason to thank him. Indeed, it was that book which produced Fenimore Cooper's
                    travesty on the "Mingoes." When Heckewelder wrote from mere hearsay (as he did
                    about the Six Nations—Cooper's Mingoes—getting his information
                    concerning them from that part of the 
                        Delaware
                     nation which had broken away from the Iroquois political system),20
                    he could be very wrong. But when he described what he saw with his own eyes, he was excellent.
            That is true of the rest of the Moravians. It was not as interpreters of Indian life but as
                    participants in it, and as reporters of casual contacts with individual Indians (not observed as
                    types or cases), that they made their real contribution to science.
            So, if there is little formal study of the Indians in the Moravian records, what does it matter? If
                    you want firsthand data—not someone else's synthesis of customs, beliefs, and
                    personality traits—for your own studies of the Indian as

                            of Teedyuscung), a blend of Munsee, Unami, and Mahican, remained in the Six Nations orbit.

                     a going concern; if you want to know how the Indian looked
                    after his family, what pleasure he took in music, how he responded to kindness—and to
                    cruelty; if you want to know what pride he took in his nation, to what degree he loved his garden,
                    his hunting territory, his village; or what was his solution of the old and universal problem (which
                    still bedevils us) —how to reconcile freedom with one's duty to society; in a
                    word, if you want to know where the Indian's heart lay, and what promise of a native
                    American civilization the white man destroyed by his premature coming—go to the Moravian
                    records. They contain the materials out of which you can shape for yourselves the answers.
         
         
         
            The 
                        German

            An effort to locate files of 
                        German
                     newspapers and periodicals published in Indiana met with little success. In many
                    instances not a single copy was available to give an idea of the nature and contents of the
                    publication. Little is known about their editors.1
            
            The Germans "came with the idea and with the intention of becoming Americans actively
                    participating in the social and political life" of their adopted country. Upon their
                    arrival, they were frequently confused and bewildered, but a paper in their own language served
                    "as a trusted and benevolent guide." The 
                        German
                     press played an important role in their political, social, and cultural life in the 
                        United States
                    .2 It also contributed to the assimilation of the Gemn element in
                    America.
            While 
                        German
                     newspapers were not printed in Indiana until the nineteenth century, they were
                    published in other parts of the country at a much earlier date. An early one in America, the Philadelphische Zeitung, was published by Benjamin 
                        Franklin
                    . The first number was issued on May 6, 1732, as a sample copy, and the regular
                    publication of the paper began on June 24, 1732. The paper existed for only a short time. Seven
                    years later, however, Christopher Sauer, the well-known publisher of 
                        Germantown
                    , 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , started Der Hoch Deutsch Pennsylvanische Geschicht Schreiber. This
                    paper is usually credited with being the first permanent 
                        German
                     paper in the Uqited States. Although the title of the paper varied, in 1762 it was
                    changed to the 
                  
                            Germantown

            As the Germans moved westward, 
                        Ohio
                     followed in the footsteps of 
                        Pennsylvania
                     and published newspapers for their benefit. Among the first 
                        German

                        German
                     newspapers appeared in 
                        Cincinnati

            For numerous reasons, Germans began to cross the boundary line of 
                        Ohio
                     and follow routes into Indiana. By 1850, they constituted 52.52 per cent of the total
                    foreign population in the latter state.5 The Hoosier State, therefore, also
                    followed the pattern of 
                        Pennsylvania
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     by publishing newspapers in the 
                        German
                     language. The English language press, however, had preceded foreign publications in
                    Indiana.
            With the publication of the Indiana Gazette at 
                        Vincennes
                     on July 31, 1804, printing was introduced into the Hoosier State by Elihu Stout,6 who shipped his wooden press from 
                        Frankfort
                    , 
                        Kentucky

                        Wabash
                     rivers. In April, 1806, the plant was destroyed by fire. This misfortune did not
                    discourage Stout. He returned to 
                        Kentucky
                     to obtain another press and paper which was transported to 
                        Vincennes
                     by pack mules. On July 4, 1807, the first issue of the Western Sun

                                Ten years after the close of the American Revolution, Elihu's parents, Judiah
                                and Mary Stout, migrated west and settled in 
                                    Lexington
                                ,

                                 and came to 
                                    Vincennes
                                 to try his luck. Elizabeth M. Denehie, "Indiana's First

                        Fort Wayne
                    . There is some doubt as to whether it was ever actually printed. C. Schmitz did
                    purchase type and circulated a prospectus. According to T. B. Helm it was published, but to date no
                    copy has been located.8 The next attempt to establish a 
                        German
                     paper, Die Staatsxeitung, was made by Georg Walker9 at 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1844.10 The following year he established the Hochwächter which was suspended in 1849 when Walker became a victim of the
                    cholera. In 1847, Julius Bötticher, a Prussian, founded the first successful 
                        German
                     newspaper, the Indiana Volksblatt, in 
                        Indianapolis
                    .11 As the 
                        German
                     population increased, more newspapers in their native tongue began to appear in the
                    Hoosier State. World War I, however, sounded the death knell for many.
            The Sunday editions were never considered a part of the regular daily or weekly paper and were always
                    edited and listed as separate publications. For instance, the 
                        Terre Haute
                    
                    Banner called its Sunday edition the Literarisches
                    Sonntags-blatt because it specialized in literature, and more or less scholarly discussions.
                    Probably a unique publication was the Spottvogel of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . A characteristic description of it might be referred to as a pleasing blend of the
                    usual American Sunday paper, Fliegende Blaetter, and Punch. It
                    had a wide circulation and was one of the last 
                        German
                     papers to suspend publication.
            Since it was possible to examine only a few newspapers and periodicals, no attempt will be made to
                    give a description of the publications in Indiana. The list which follows has been arranged in
                    alphabetical order by towns.12 Despite the fact that this is the most complete

                             in 1808. He studied the ology at the University of Tubingen under Georg W. F.
                            Hegel and David Strauss. In 1833 or 1834 he came to America and settled in 
                                Tuscarawas County
                            ,

                            , until 1838 when he moved to

                                Ohio
                            . He did not remain long here but went to 
                                Cincinnati
                            , then

                            , and finally to 
                                Indianapolis
                             in 1844 where he remained until his death in 1849. Gustav Körner,

            The Wonderful West Samuel A. Custer's Report on His Travels, 1880
            
                    Edited by Arthur R. Hogue and Otis E Young*
               
                
            Samuel A. Custer, born October 31, 1818, in 
                        Washington
                     County, 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , had, for some forty years prior to the journey which he described in his letter
                    published below, farmed in 
                        Fulton
                     County and then in 
                        Cass County
                    , Indiana, and operated a brickyard near 
                        Logansport
                    . In 1880 he sold the brickyard and used his new-found leisure by setting out alone to
                    see the western 
                        United States
                     and to visit his brother-in-law, Colonel David P. Jenkins of Spokane Falls, 
                        Washington
                     Territory.
            To make a western trip was not unusual in the 1880's. Many a farmer and small businessman
                    scouted the country for good land or business opportunities, but the writing of a detailed report
                    was unusual, and, as is customary with all such annals of ordinary folk, its preservation was mere
                    chance. Men and women who aspire to or attain distinction often endeavor to preserve diaries,
                    photographs, and other personal documents. On the other hand, farmers, mechanics, and small burghers
                    are often enveloped in oblivion because their records do not immediately seem worth saving. The
                    letter of Samuel A. Custer, which is in the Crew Papers, an unpublished collection of family papers,
                    now in the possession of Arthur R. Hogue, gives an account of a middle-aged, well-to-do, but
                    otherwise undistinguished small businessman who traveled through the West in 1880. He noted the
                    means of transportation used, his impression of the towns he visited, the amusements he engaged in,
                    and such things as had more than ordinary appeal.
            Undoubtedly Mrs. Elizabeth H. Crew, the "Sisternlaw" addressed in
                    Custer's letter, should have the credit for its preservation, along with some two hundred
                    other interesting items. Elizabeth Crew, the youngest daughter of Israel and Elizabeth Horseman
                    Jenkins, was born January 7, 1821. On December 28, 1837, she married Jesse B. Crew, a 
                        Quaker
                     of 
                        Mt. Pleasant
                    , 
                        Ohio
                    . After his death, July 30, 1865, Elizabeth moved to Short Creek, 
                        Harrison County
                    , 
                        Ohio
                    , where she lived until her death

                     about 1903. At the latter place correspondence was carried on
                    with a large circle of relatives among whom were her sister, Hannah, the wife of Samuel A. Custer,
                    and her brother, David P. Jenkins, of Spokane Falls. Upon Elizabeth's death the papers
                    which she had collected went to her grandson, Robert Barclay Hoge of 
                        Belmont County
                    , 
                        Ohio
                    , and through him to Arthur R. Hogue.
            The career of David P. Jenkins had a real connection with the document which follows, because he kept
                    before the Jenkins family the excitements of the westward movement in which he shared. Beginning the
                    study and practice of law in Steubenville, 
                        Ohio
                    , in 1844, David soon moved to 
                        Cincinnati
                    . In March, 1845, a better location was sought in 
                        Lafayette
                    , Indiana, and five years later Hennepin, 
                        Illinois
                    , appeared more attractive. He took his family to LaSalle in 1852 in the hope that the
                    terminal of the 
                        Illinois
                     Central Railroad and the head of navigation on the 
                        Illinois
                     River would create a booming city. During the Civil War, Jenkins served as Lieutenant
                    Colonel of the 14th 
                        Illinois
                     Cavalry. After 
                        Appomattox
                     he continued to move, always westward, through mining towns such as Custer described in
                    his letter, until he settled finally at Spokane Falls (now Spokane, 
                        Washington
                    ). His letters never ceased to radiate the enthusiasm of the land speculator. For
                    example, about 1885 (the letter was undated) he wrote to his sister, Elizabeth Crew: "Our
                    young city [Spokane] is growing very fast—when I was at your place or rather
                    Hoge's—our little town had about 15 or 1600 Inhabitants. That was 3 years
                    ago—we have now near 5,000 and I think in another year we will have 8,000. Our scenery is
                    fine and the country very healthy and climate splendid. Mercury has not reached zero yet this
                    winter."
            For thirty years or more Colonel Jenkins wrote in this manner about the communities in which he
                    lived. His letters and conversation alone might have induced Samuel Custer to take a long look at
                    the wonders of the West. But there were other reasons. The Crews, the Thompsons, the Hills, and the
                    Custers, plus all of the Jenkins family, who contributed letters to the Crew Papers, were all
                    involved in the westward movement of the nineteenth century. The Crew and Jenkins families had their
                    roots in the James River region and 
                        Charles City County
                     of 
                        Virginia
                    . The agitation of the slavery issue and Nat Turner's Rebellion (1831)
                    prompted many 
                        Virginia
                     Quakers to join relatives who had earlier migrated to eastern 
                        Ohio
                    .  Their descendants then pushed west into Indiana
                    and 
                        Illinois
                    . Some of them went all the way to the Rocky Mountains while others seriously considered
                    moving. Their letters indicated that the minds of these people were filled with thoughts about the
                    West. It is not surprising then that when Custer found himself with leisure, health, and sufficient
                    money he traveled —West!
            No attempt has been made to note Custer's deviations from modern, or consistent, spelling.
                    In order to assist the reader in understanding the otherwise involved sentence structure,
                    punctuation and capital letters have been inserted where that was deemed necessary. The manuscript
                    itself consists of eighteen ruled foolscap pages on which Custer wrote in a very legible script,
                    using a purple ink which is now somewhat faded.

                        Respected Sisternlaw I have been wanting to write to you for along time but could not
                                    find out your address. … It has been more than a year Since I wrdte to
                                    you and then I Requested you to come and take a western trip but I never Received
                                    any answer from you—I tried to get Some of my acquaintance to go with me
                                    but Could not. So I concluded to go any how. I left home the 2 day of June [1880],
                                    and went to 
                                        Chicago
                                     from there I took the Rockisland R.R. and crossed the 
                                        Mississippi
                                     to Davonport [

                                    here I went to 
                                        Topeka
                                     the Capital of

                                    . Here I took the Atcheson Topek and Santa Fee R.R. to Florence where I
                                    Remained one day. Here I took the Branch R.R. to El Dorado the County Seat of

                                     where I stoped one day. This place is a disert country. They had no
                                    Rain when I was ther for 2 years.
                        From here I went to La gunta [La Junta] in Collorado2 at the
                                    junction of the R.R.,3 one Branch leeding to Santa Fee and one
                                    to Pueblo. Here I had to wate 8 hours for the Pueblo train but I was in no hurry and
                                    Enjoyed my Self in hunting curiosities along the 
                                        Arkansas

                                    of dimond Shaped clusters of dull cristles. I also passed away the time Scareing up
                                    Jack Rabbits and looking at the Prarie Dogs. From here I went to Pueblo where I
                                    Remain one day and knight. This is the oldest town in Collorado,4 and [commands a] full view of the Rockey Mountains near

                                    Collorado Springs, a beautiful city of 5,000 inhabitance5 6
                                    miles from the foot of Pikes Peak, and in fair view of that perpetual Snow capped
                                    Mountain Peak whose towering head Rises 14,234 feet.6 Here I
                                    Remain one week visiting many places of grand natural scenery of which I will name a
                                    few and make an attempt to describe Some of them. I first visited a place called the
                                    garden of the gods. It is a collection of Rocks 3 miles from the mountains; these
                                    Rocks are Entirely detached from each other Some Redd, Some gray, Some white and
                                    Rise up to the hight of 325 feet, peaked at the top like Church Spires. They cover
                                    Several acres of land. This is grand Scenery. Next was the Manatau [Manitou]
                                    Springs. These is 4 in No [number] near the foot of Pikes Peak. They are strong
                                    mineral water and much Resorted to by Invalids and tourists.
                        On the morning of June 21 I tried to get Company to go with me to the top of Pikes
                                    Peak but failed, So I got 3 days Rashions and put out alone. I took the trail which
                                    was cut out [of] brush and Rocks by the government; it is 2 feet wide and 14 miles
                                    long up the first Range of the Rockey Mountains. I arrived at [the] timberline which
                                    is 11,000 feet high and is as high in the air as vegitation will grow without
                                    feeling any fatigued,

                                    Short and hard. But at Sundown I accomplished the task, and took a long look in all
                                    directions, and it is said a person can See 150 miles from this point—to
                                    the west it is mountains as far as the Eye can See and many Snow capped peaks; many
                                    miles a way to the East you can see far over the great American Desert. From the top
                                    of the Peak I had 6 miles down another trail to a house where I arrived in Safety at
                                    10 o'clock. The Moon was full and the Sky was clear and I had
                                    ev'ry thing my own way; no one to molest or make afraid; the Bears and
                                    Panthers was not out that knight, So I enjoyed the Eavenings walk very much, and got
                                    a bed and Rested well. This is Called the lake house. There is abeautiful Clear lake
                                    [withl in a few feet of the house. It Covers 15 acres of land, is 30 feet deep, no
                                    inlet or outlet. From here there is 2 trails down the mountain. I took the Bear
                                    Creek Canion trail as it contains the wildest and grandest natural Scenery, many
                                    waterfalls, [and] high Rocks. I arrived at my Hotel at 3 oclock P.M. greately
                                    Pleased with my Mountain Rambles.
                        I next visited the Grand Canion of the 
                                        Arkansas
                                     River. I went with a Sunday School Excursion 120 miles on the 
                                        Denver
                                     Reogrand R. R. via Pueblo and 
                                        Canion City
                                    . As you enter the Canion the mountains Slope gently away on either
                                    Side; advancing farther, the Rugged walls Rise higher and higher. The River is
                                    forced into a norrow [narrow] bed Scarcely twelve feet in width in places and goes
                                    foming, Roaring and dashing on. The Royal gorge is Reached and gigantic walls of
                                    Rocks Rise on either Side nearly perpendicular 2,000 [feet] high. Alon [g] the Side
                                    of this Rapid River is a norrow gaged R.R. cut in the Sollid Rock and So crooked
                                    that the traveller cannot see but a few Rods either way; this R.R. leeds to
                                        Leadville.7 Of all the scenery for which Collorado is famous
                                    nothing can Compare with this grand natural scenery; the world is Shut out; youare
                                    alone with nature in her grandest moods. We all Returned to Collorado Springs at 10
                                    oclock at knight. Collorado Springs is a nicely laid off City with wide Streets and
                                    nice

                                            disputed between the

                                            resolved in the compromise where the

                        From here I went to 
                                        Denver
                                    , the Capital of Collorado, a fine City of 40,000 inhabitance8 on the South Plat River 20 miles from the mountains and one of
                                    the most [active] business places between 
                                        Chicago
                                     and 
                                        San Francisco
                                    . I Remained here 4 days visiting all the places of Business and
                                    Scenery. Here I took the cars to Golden9 at the foot of the
                                    mountains, there Changed cars to a norrow gaged Road Running up Clear Creek canion
                                    to Blackhock [Blackhawk] and Central [City] far up the mountains. These are boath
                                    Rich mining towns and this is the Steepest R.R. in the west.10
                                    At Blackhock I took a trip into the Bobtail tunnel this is a Rich Gold mine. When it
                                    was first opened the Company sunk a shaft on the top of the mountain 600 feet deep
                                    and finding good paying Gold quarts they went to the foot of the hill and cut a
                                    large tunnel level 1,300 feet into the bottom of the Shaft and laid a R.R. track;
                                    then cut out of the Sollid Rock a Room Sufficient to put in a large ingine and 7
                                    Steem boilers for hoisting the oar and pumping water out of the Shaft, which was
                                    sunk 700 feet below the mashinery. When I was there the Shaft above the mashinery is
                                    ased [used] for a chimney or Smokestack and is the longest one I ever seen. The
                                    tunnel extends 1,100 feet beyond the mashinery being 2,400 feet in all.11 I went with two other men to the far end of the tunnel and
                                    there I got a Rich Specimen of Gold quarts. There is a great many of mines worked in
                                    this neighborhood and a Number of Stamp mills Running, Crushing the quarts Rock and
                                    getting the precious mettle.12 From here I went across the
                                    mountains to 
                                        Georgetown
                                    
                           13 in a buggy. This is another mining town all most
                                    entirely Surrounded with high steep mountains. Here is where

                                    Here I got a R.R. ticket to Scheyenne [Cheyenne] Wyoming Teritory, where I arived
                                    June 29 and Remained 3 days. This place is in a desert Country. It once was af
                                    lourishing place but is now on the decline.14
                        
                        While in 
                                        Chicago
                                     I made arangements with an Excursion manager that was getting up an
                                    Excursion to San Franci [sco] Cal. to Send me a ticket to Scheyenne and I would join
                                    the train at this place. I received the ticket and took the train at 2 P.M. July
                                    2nd. We passed over many miles of planes and deserts that afternoon nothing of note
                                    except Seeing many antelope in flocks of 8 to 15. The train would pass
                                    them—Some would Run, others would not be much alarmed. They are beautiful
                                    animals and the best meat I ever eat. Knight came on and Closed the Scene but did
                                    not Stop the train. The morning appeared Clear and beautiful. The first Station was
                                    Rock Springs;15 this is a desert country with many Snow Sheds
                                    and tunnels. In the after noon we Reach 
                                        Utah
                                     teritory, and the mountain Scenery become more grand and Singular. At
                                    the enterance of Echo canion is a deep norrow gorge Called the Devils gate; also
                                    near by is the Devils Slide. This consists of two Rows of thin Rocks Running up a
                                    Steep mountain Side about 10 feet apart forming two craggy walls from 15 to 30 feet,

                                    on Spokan River. Here I found your Brother David;29 he was

                                    I Stayed with him one week; we had a verry pleasant time. His house was within 50
                                    feet of the Spokan River which abounds in beautiful fish of good quallity. I would
                                    get up and catch a mess and have them for breakfast any morning. I Enjoyed the
                                    fishing very much but this is a wild Country, more Indians than whites. David
                                    Expected to Return to Seattle the fore part of December; he left Seattle the first
                                    of May 1878 and went to Spokanfalls as there was a great boom for that place, it
                                    being on the line of the Northern Pacific R.R. and Since that time there has been
                                    150 miles of the R.R. from Spokanfalls to the 
                                        Columbia

                                    Expected to have it all complated this winter. I have got two letters from David
                                    Since I got home but have not had any for 4 months. I wrote to him but he has not
                                    answered yet.
                        I left him the 4th of august and Returned to 
                                        Portland
                                    . From there I went to Puget Sound. This is an inlet of the ocean and
                                    one of the best Shipping harbers in the world and is to be the terminous of the
                                    Northern Pacific R.R. It lies between the Cost Range and the Caskade mountains and
                                    is nearly Surrounded by mountains which is covered with large tall fur timber. It is
                                    no farming Country. There is Several towns on Puget Sound; Seattle is the largest.

                                    kings [King] County. From here I went to Olympia (at the Extream South end of the
                                    Sound) via tacoma and Stelacoom [Steilacoom]. I arrived at Olympia 5 P.M. This is

                                    . I Remained at 
                                        Portland
                                     3 days wating for the Steem Ship to Carry me back to

                                    . The boat left 
                                        Portland
                                     August 16 at 3 A.M. and arived at 
                                        San Francisco

                        From 
                                        San Francisco
                                     I took the Southern Pacific R.R. to Monteray, via. San jose, pronounced
                                    Sanoza. Monteray is the oldest town in Callifornia and has the evenest Climate of
                                    any place on the Globe. Here is a beautiful Sandy beach with some

                                            population of Seattle in 1880 to be 3,533 persons.
                              
                                 31
                                            Ibid., gives the population of Olympia as 1,232.
                           
                                     Rocks in the edge of the water; on these Rocks
                                    I got some nice small Shells, also 2 Star fish and along the Shore was many bones,
                                    Some verry large. I measured one Rib, it was 16 feet long and 3 feet in
                                    circumference and many other bones of corresponding Size. These was bones of whales.
                                    From here I went to Santa Cruz a beautiful town on Santa Cruz bay. Here I took a
                                    long Ramble along the Sea Shore and found some curious Specimens. From here I
                                    Returned to 
                                        San Francisco
                                     and procured tickets to the yo Semite Valley and the big trees via
                                    lathrop, Stockton and milton by R.R., from 
                                        Milton
                                     90 miles by Stage via Copperopolis, Chinies Camp and big oak flats. The
                                    yo Semite Valley is in the heart of the Sirenevada [Sierra 
                                        Nevada
                                    ] mountains and is the grandest natural Scenery on Earth. The highest
                                    waterfalls that has ever ben discovered are seen here. The first that meets the eye
                                    is bridle veil, 940 [feet] perpendicular, yosemite falls 2,634 ft, Ribbon falls
                                        3,20032 vernal falls 350, 
                                        Nevada
                                     falls 700 ft, South fork [falls] 600 ft. I Stood near these falls and
                                    viewed them with pleasure and astonishment.
                        The yo Semite Valley is 8 miles long and one half to one mile in width and on either
                                    Side there is a perpendicular mountain of Sollid Rock averaging 4,000 feet high and
                                    Some Peaks much higher. I will name a few: Cathedral Spire 2,660 [feet in
                                    elevation], this is a beautiful [formation]. Standing in the valley [are the] Three
                                    Graces 3,400, Three Brothers 3,830. All these are in a Cluster neer each other and
                                    Run up lik[e] Church Steeples and are delightful Scenery. Sentinel Dome 4,150 feet
                                    high; this is a beautiful Round topt Rock. South [Half?] Dome 5,000 feet. Chouds
                                    [Cloud's] Rest 6,150 feet-this is a wonderful place and cannot be
                                    described. In this valley there is a beautiful Clear Lake called myror lake and here
                                    the beholder has the most delightful views of all others; by standing at the edge of
                                    this lake and looking down into the water you have all the beautiful Surroundings of
                                    Rocks and trees pictured at your feet.
                        From here I went to the Callivarus [Calaveras] big tree grove. This is another of
                                    natures wonderful works. This grove has 93 standing trees measureing from 18 to 32
                                    feet in diameter. One of these trees 25 feet in diameter was boared [wedged] down
                                    which Required the labor of 5 men 25 days. 
                              
                                 32 Here, Custer made one of his rare errors, Yosemite
                                            Falls are the tallest in the valley.
                           
                                     Part of this tree was taken to the centennial
                                    [Exposition]. The first cut is 20 feet long and layes near the Stump. Just imagin a
                                    log 20 feet long and 25 feet thick or high and it laying on the ground as high as a
                                    good sised barn. The Stump of this tree was Smoothed off and a nice Round frame
                                    building [constructed] around it and is used for a dencing hall, giving ample Room
                                    for 32 dancers. There is other trees lying on the ground much larger. There is one
                                    that is partly decayed; from the best calculations it was 40 feet in diameter and
                                    425 feet in length. Those standing are from 250 to 350 feet high. There is one
                                    hollow log that a man can Ride a common Sised horse 80 feet through it. I walked
                                    through it.33
                        
                        My next visit of any note was the Steemboat Springs in 
                                        Nevada
                                    .34 These are curious boiling hot Springs that Send
                                    up volumns of Steem that can be Seen for miles. From here I went to 
                                        Virginia
                                     City the Great mining town which lies high up on the Side of a very
                                    Steep mountain.35 Here is mines that are Sunk to the debth of
                                    2,000 to 3,000 feet deep and have been verry Rich36 but are not
                                    paying So well at present, and at the bottom of these mines there is a Strong flow
                                    of boiling hot water which Requires a large ingine and a powerful pumt to keep the
                                    water out, and it is 140 degrees Faren heat yet men works down there. They work 100
                                    men at a time and change ev'ry 8 hours. It is wonderful to See the amount
                                    of work done in these countryes for gold.
                        From here I went to Great Salt lake City where I spent 4 days in that noted Place.
                                    The first thing that attracted my attention was a hot String [Spring] near the R.R.
                                    3 miles from the City, where I got the conductor to let me off. This Spring flows
                                    out under a Rock at the foot of a mountain and forms quite a creek and Runs a few
                                    Rods and forms a lake which is called hot Spring lake. This Spring is Scalding hot
                                    and Smells very Strong of Brimstone. I Enjoyed my self here for a time, getting
                                    pebles out of the Scalding water and viewing the wonderful works of nature. Then I
                                    went down to the City, procured 
                              
                                 33 Custer's description of Yosemite and the
                                            Calavarus big trees are very accurate according to comparison with the

                                 34 Custer apparently traveled to Steamboat in

                                            , by way of Stockton, Seramento, and Reno. Steamboat is fifteen
                                            miles south of Reno and ten miles northwest of

                                     a boarding house, then took a view of the
                                    place. The City is near the foot of the Wasa[t]ch mountains and about 20 miles to
                                    the nearest accesable place to Salt Lake and is laid off in 10 acres squairs with
                                    very broad Streets and Side walks well Shaded on either Side and a Streem of water
                                    Running along the gutters.
                        There is Some fine buildings in the City, a number of Churches, Protestant Episcople
                                    Church, Methodist, Catholick, Presbyterians, Congregationalist, and the Mormans
                                    which are the most numerous of all and have the largest buildings I ever Saw. The
                                    Tabernacle is a huge and Rounded [edifice] Covered with a rounded Roof of Shingles
                                    and is about the Shape of the half of an Egg Shell divided length ways. The building
                                    is 233 feet [by] 133 ft and in the center is 70 feet from floor to ceiling. The
                                    seating capasity is 13,452;37 the Gallery is sufficiently large
                                    to Seat 3,750 people, and at General Semi-annual conferences it is frequently
                                    filled. There are 20 doors to the Tabernacle, nearly all of them 9 feet wide and all
                                    opening outwards and the immence congregation can all be let out in one and [one]
                                    half minutes. At the west end is the grand organ; when constructed it was the
                                    largest in America. The pipes number nearly three thousand, the longest 32 feet and
                                    2 feet square. The entire Structure is 58 feet to the top of the great towers, 30
                                    feet deep and 30 feet wide. 4 men are Required to work the blowers. It makes a great
                                    noise with the assistance of 100 Singers. I was at one of their meetings.
                        The Now [New] Temple which they are now building when finished will be one of the
                                    most Remarkable edifices in America. The length of the building East and west is 200
                                    feet and its width 100 feet. The foundations which are of a Reddish quarts are laid
                                    16 feet below the surface of the earth and are also 16 feet in thickness. The walls
                                    Resting on these foundations are 9 feet 9 inches thick of a light gray Granite, all
                                    of which [blocks] are dressed Square. The Corner Stone of this Structure was laid
                                    April 6th 1853 and the building has now Reached the hight of 50 feet at their
                                    present Summit. The walls are 7 feet 6 inches thick but will be Reduced to 5 feet
                                    when they have Reached their allamate [ultimate] hight of 100 feet. Their is to be
                                    three towers at each end of the building to be 200 feet high, each to contain a
                                    circular Stairway which

                                    up. I went up this winding Stare way and Stood on the wall 50 feet high and talked
                                    with the workmen-the Temple has already cost 3,000,000 Dollars and the estimated
                                    Cost when finished is ten to twelve Million Dollars.38
                        
                        There is some grand Mountain scenery around Salt lake City. One noted high Round Peak
                                    is called Ensign Peak 2 miles from the City. It is said that the Prophet Joseph
                                    Smith Saw in a vision this Same Peak and the Standard of Zion unfurled on this Peak,
                                    and when the Mormons first landed here they drilled a hole in the Rocks on the top
                                    of this Peak and planted their banner here and the hole Remains to this day. I Seen
                                    it last September. From this elevated position a moast magnificent Range is visible.
                                    Mount nebo39 90 miles South I could see very Plainly and many
                                    other Snow capped Peaks of the wasatch mountains. The view extends to allmost an
                                    equal distance to the North. Westward it takes in nearly all of the Great American
                                    desert and also all of Salt lake with its islands. The most interesting feture of
                                    this entire Region is the Great Salt lake its Self. It is beautiful Clear Salt water
                                    So Strong with Salt that 4 barrels of it boiled down will make one of Salt. There is
                                    a baithing place at the South end of the Lake reached by R.R. from the City where a
                                    great many persons go to take a bath or swim in this wonderful Lake. You can get a
                                    baithing Suit and Room and fresh water to Rench off after comeing out of the Brine
                                    for 25 cts. I enjoyed the swim very much. It is impossble to Sink the weters is so

                                    Remain at the Surface, but with a little practice men, women and children Soon learn
                                    to keep their heads up and Resort here daily in great numbers. Any person by keeping

                                    living thing in or near the waters.

            The Record of an Indiana School District, 1837-1844
            
                    Edited by Arthur R. Hogue*
               
                
            The lack of a centralized, state-wide system of schools produced a condition in Indiana, during the
                    period 1816–1843, which contemporary observers and later historians viewed with regret.
                    Indeed, not until after the Civil War did the schools secure a real measure of state organization.
                    Prior to that time the purely local character of school management permitted school district
                    trustees to provide terms of unequal length, books of their own choice, poorly qualified teachers,
                    and their own methods of payment. This situation, wrote Logan Esarey: "lasted until the
                    revision of the school law of 1843. The latter date perhaps marks the lowest level of general
                    intelligence ever reached in the State. The harmful effects of the failure to organize were felt in
                    all classes and fields of social life."1
            
            The document published here throws some light on the procedures and financial records actually
                    employed by school district trustees in 
                        Jennings County
                    , which, by reason of its proximity to the 
                        Ohio
                     River, had received an influx of settlers as early as 1815 and by 1830 contained a
                    population of 3,950.2
            
            In stark simplicity the document sets forth the affairs of School District No. 6 in Congressional
                    Township 6 North Range 9 East. Located in the southeastern part of 
                        Jennings County
                    , it comprised most of Bigger Township and part of 
                        Vernon
                     Township.3
            
            The manuscript, discovered in 1949 by the editor, consists of sixteen soiled and faded pages, 5
                    1/2" × 7 3/4", stitched together to form a little book without covers.
                    Since the pages are not numbered one can only conjecture that they form the entire account without
                    breaks or omissions until the voters decided to discontinue the school. So far as possible the
                    arrangement of the materials and the spelling of the unknown clerks is reproduced

                     exactly as written without editorial comment. At this point,
                    however, one can note the variation in the spelling of family names. Thus one finds: Agon, Agan, or
                    Again; Bingaman, or Bingerman; Frasee, or Frasey; Hughs, or Hughes; McLaughlin, or Mcglaughin;
                    Vardiman, Vardaman, or Vardamon.
            Terminology within the document deserves a word of explanation. For example, the
                    "draw," mentioned on September 3,1838; February 27,1839; March, 1840; and March
                    28,1844, undoubtedly refers to the funds available to the school district trustees, who, by a law of
                    1833, could "draw" on the township treasurer for sums produced by the sale or
                    lease of land within section 16 of the congressional township, section 16 being land set apart for
                    school purposes.4 Since these funds could be deposited, if the school trustees
                    so desired, one will come across references to drawing the interest (6%) on March 1 and September 1.
            The financial amounts given in the document will not seem large to modern readers accustomed to
                    modern prices, nor were they actually impressive amounts a century ago. Land sold at about two
                    dollars an acre; thus an entire section might produce only $1,280.00 for educational purposes when a
                    certain section 16 was entirely sold. This was supplemented, of course, by school taxes, managed by
                    the school district trustees and paid by each qualified voter according to his wealth. Moreover, the
                    trustees could hold each male freeholder liable for two days work each year on the schoolhouse. How
                    heavily the school tax bore upon those paying it—and what the financial compensation
                    meant in real income for the teacher—can be indicated roughly by giving some prices for
                    the period. A letter from Hamilton County, 1840, stated that in central Indiana: "wheat is
                    worth 50 cts per bushel; corn 18 3/4 to 25 cts; oats 18 3/4 cts; Irish potatoes, 12 1/2 cts; sweet
                    from 37 1/2 to 50 cts per bushel. Pork is worth 3 1/2 cts per pound; beef 2 1/2 to 3 cts per lb.;
                    butter 8 1/3; honey 10 cts; suger (home) 12 1/2; 
                        New Orleans

            The attendance record for the period from October 14, 1839, to January 11, 1840, of the document must
                    represent the total numbers of pupil-days attended by all of the children of one family, for the
                    totals are too high, in some cases, to have been accumulated by the attendance of one pupil. Five of
                    the entries show totals of one hundred or more; the maximum number of days between the opening and
                    the closing of school —between October 14 and January 11—is 88, including
                    Sundays.
            School laws required the trustees to make the enumeration of pupils between the ages of five and
                    twenty-one. They also required the trustees to keep a record of the land held by the qualified votem

               List of World War II Historical Studies Made by Civilian Agencies of the Federal
                        Government. (
                        Washington
                    : National Historical Publications Commission, General Services Administration, 1951,
                    pp. v, 53. Index.)
            No event in history has ever been so conscientiously and self-consciously recorded for the benefit of
                    posterity as was the American participation in World War II. From the flood of published results now
                    pouring from the presses, the public has gained the impression that there was at least one historian
                    attached to every regimental headquarters, pacing the decks of every battleship, and riding into
                    combat in every tank. If civilian war agencies had been as permanent as the Pentagon, and as well
                    endowed, their publishing programs would have betrayed the presence of a professional historian in
                    every office in 
                        Washington
                    , as well.
            Whether this mass worship at the shrine of militant Clio was history or hysteria is a debated
                    subject. At any rate, it produced a tremendous volume of historical writing, published and
                    otherwise, with which the future students of World War II will have to reckon. By far the greater
                    part of it remains unpublished and therefore uncatalogued. The National Archives has performed
                    another of its invaluable services to American historians by bringing together, for the first time,
                    a list of all these wartime historical studies, both published and in all conditions short of
                    publication, made by the civilian agencies of the Federal Government.
            The "official" World War II history program was conceived in 1941 by the Bureau of
                    the Budget, which not only initiated many administrative studies of its own but encouraged other
                    federal agencies to establish historical sections. Eventually, some forty-odd civilian agencies
                    responded to this suggestion, and the entire program was co-ordinated by a Committee on Records of
                    War Administration, composed of representatives from the Library of Congress, the National Archives,
                    and a number of scholarly societies. The fruits of their labors, together with a few items produced
                    outside the regularly sponsored program are listed in the work under review.
            The compilers of this list enter their customary demurrer against pretensions to exhaustiveness but
                    it is doubtful if they have overlooked any significant work. More than 500 studies sponsored by 51
                    agencies (which are listed alphabetically  without regard to
                    their current status in the federal hierarchy) appear by title. Of these, only 115 have been
                    printed, and 99 "processed" (presumably by multigraph, mimeograph, etc.) for
                    distribution. Copies of these 214 studies are readily available, either in depository libraries, the
                    National Archives, or the Budget Bureau Library. The remaining three-fifths of the studies
                    catalogued exist only in typed copies or in some form of unfinished draft, accessible only in the
                    deposited records of the agency in the National Archives or still in the possession of the agency
                    itself. It is a matter of some comparative interest that while certain agencies, among which are the
                    Selective Service System, the OSRD and the OPA, finished or are in the process of finishing a rather
                    elaborate series of historical studies, the majority of the Government's wartime
                    agencies, even such important ones as the WPB, failed to get their monographs much beyond the
                    "processing" stage. It is also intriguing to notice that the names of eminent
                    American historians are attached to some of these unpublished reports. All of the pertinent
                    information about each study, including the indispensable point of where it may (or may not) be
                    consulted, seems to have been included in this bibliography. An index referring to the agency which
                    was the object of the study rather than the one which sponsored it is a necessary guide through the
                    weird jungle of federal bureaucracy. Unfortunately, this bibliography itself may be difficult for
                    the average historical student to consult. It was prepared for the National Historical Publications
                    Commission and only a limited number of extra copies apparently were reproduced for other
                    governmental agencies.

                        Text
                     by Dee Brown. Picture research by Martin F. Schmitt. (
                        New York
                    : Charles Scribner's Sons, 1952, pp. xxii, 264. Illustrations and
                    bibliography but no index. $7.50.)
            This large, handsome book deals with many things besides trail driving and trail drivers. In eight
                    chapters with a total of 229 illustrations, it presents a colorful panorama of life in the so-called
                    Cow Country during the latter half of the nineteenth century. The chapters average approximately ten
                    pages of text followed by some twenty pages of pictures, most of them with explanatory notes of
                    several lines. The pages, more  over, are large, measuring more
                    than eleven and a half by eight and a half inches.
            The text is well written and tells in very interesting fashion the story of most of the leading
                    figures engaged in the range cattle industry. In addition it describes the deeds or misdeeds of many
                    other characters who played a part in the life of this portion of the West when it was really wild.
                    These include the frontier peace officers as sheriffs, town marshals, and 
                        Texas
                     rangers, as well as the outlaws, cattle rustlers, buffalo hunters, gamblers, soldiers
                    and run-of-the-mine cowhands. Also depicted are the picturesque Britons and Continentals that
                    operated ranches, the Plains Indians, and the few women, good or bad, who were to be found in the
                    rough masculine society of the range area.
            Here are accounts of the long drives, of such cow towns as Abilene and 
                        Dodge City
                    , of beef bonanzas, of range wars, and of the great operators of the Northern Plains and
                    the tragic winter of 1886–87 so disastrous to them. Interesting as is the text, however,
                    the illustrations are even more fascinating and make the book a unique contribution to the
                    literature of the West. Most of them are made from photographs and the task of assembling such a
                    remarkable collection of pictures must have been a long and laborious one. Sources of all
                    illustrations are given in the table of contents but there are no citations given for the text. The
                    bibliography consists entirely of books, articles in periodicals, and reports but is quite
                    extensive, consisting of some five hundred volumes and other publications. This is a beautiful book
                    containing by far the finest collection of pictures of the Cow Country which this reviewer has ever
                    seen assembled in a single volume. It is a good book to own, and to read.

               Heavens On Earth: Utopian Communities in America, 1680–1880. By Mark
                    Holloway. (

                    : Library Publishers, 1951, pp. 240. Illustrations, map, bibliographical note, and
                    index. $4.75.)
            Any contribution to the very limited literature of utopian criticism is a welcome event, and
                    Holloway's treatment of some of the communitarian experiments in America is very pleasant
                    and informative reading. The book is not definitive, nor does it make any such claim, but there is a
                    surprising  amount of detail in these relatively few pages. The
                    result, however, is not at all a mere catalogue of dates, events, and figures; the style is lively
                    without being trite, and only one who is acquainted with the overwhelming mass of material on this
                    subject can properly appreciate the organization and selection which are evident in
                    Holloway's work.
            A considerable part of this attractive balance is unquestionably the product of a nice attention to
                    and judgment of the historical relation and continuity between "intellectual
                    excitements," utopians dreams, and practical experiments. The nineteenth century was
                    indeed, as Holloway remarks, "the golden age of community experiments"; there were
                    well over a hundred identifiable community projects in the first half of the century alone. Holloway
                    notes how the eager enthusiasm of devotees often pushed to practical folly the ideals of the
                    utopists; but in spite of the impracticalities, the pettiness, and the disillusion which marked most
                    of the utopian experiments, it is yet hard to avoid a feeling of disquiet in observing that the
                    twentieth century evidences little of the sublime confidence and courage which carried many of these
                    adventurers through strenuous work, hardship, and disaster without dampening the ardor of their
                    utopian quest.
            A short review is not adequate even to digest an analysis which treats of Ephrata, the Shaker
                    societies, Harmony, Bime-ler's Zoar, Owen's 
                        New Harmony
                    , the Fourier Phalanxes, and the Icarian ventures, the while bringing into the picture a
                    dozen or so of the lesser known communities. I was impressed with the skill with which Holloway
                    picked out the significant and important characteristics of these manifold and diverse experimental
                    groups, and his tolerant appraisal of the reasons for their failure shows understanding as well as
                    information. Those who have accepted the unfortunate equivalence of "uto-pian"
                    with "crackpot" may find here a new understanding, especially if their view is
                    based on the mistaken notion that utopian experiments were generally doomed because of unorthodox
                    and unworkable economic ideals. It is a strange paradox that the outstanding economic disaster among
                    utopian communities should be that fathered by a successful industrial manager, Robert Owen.
            Another feature of Holloway's description of the utopian era in America is his
                    appreciation of the positive and constructive contributions which these communitarian efforts made
                    to the intellectual and institutional life of the country, a recognition sadly lacking in most
                    surveys of this important facet of  our cultural history. 
                        New Harmony
                    , for instance, was not successful as a utopian community, but its failure should not
                    preclude an evaluation of the cultural contributions it engendered: the first kindergarten, the
                    first nursery school, the institution of free libraries, the inspiration of a free school system in
                    Indiana and hence throughout the Middle West, and the first school system offering equal advantages
                    to both sexes. Of these significant consequences of utopian experiment, Hollo-way is properly, but
                    almost uniquely, observant.
            In any such brief work one would expect to encounter occasionally somewhat sweeping generalizations
                    and opinions; while Holloway does not document his every assertion with a footnote, his descriptions
                    and judgments seem, on the whole, authoritative and sound.

               The Health of Slaves on Southern Plantations. By William Dosite Postell. (

                     State University Studies, Social Science Series Number One, 1951, pp. xiii, 231.
                    Introduction, illustrations, bibliography, and index. $3.00).
            There have been a number of articles and chapters of books, as well as published portions of diaries
                    and plantation accounts, that have dealt with the care and health of slaves, but this is the first
                    monograph that treats the subject in its entirety and in relation to the medical problems facing the
                    country as a whole.
            The study is set in its proper perspective by a summary of the medical conditions in the 
                        United States
                     in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. This resume reveals the low state of
                    public health and the apathy toward health reforms, and it shows that problems in the South differed
                    from those in other rural areas only because of climatic conditions and the large Negro population.
            Cholera and yellow fever epidemics attracted more attention than the other diseases, but Postell
                    maintains that the domestic diseases constituted the greater hazard to the slave and the owner. Of
                    these, pneumonia was probably the most fatal; but tetanus, dysentery, and dietary disturbances also
                    took a rather large toll. Negroes were the greatest sufferers from cholera, but malaria troubled
                    them little. Similarly,  there is little mention of venereal
                    infection, and tuberculosis was much less common before emancipation than after.
            To cure the ills of the slaves there were several types of "doctors": botanic,
                    regular, homeopaths, hydropathists, eclectics, and "medicine men." But domestic
                    cures—based on tradition, the "doctor book," popular magazines, and
                    agricultural journals—underlay the medical practice in the South. The prescription of the
                    "doctor" or the self-appointed practitioner might be good, bad, or indifferent and
                    the rating frequently varied from one disease to another. In comparing treatments for flux,
                    pleurisy, and worms, the author concludes that the domestic remedy was best in two cases and that
                    the botanic remedy did the "least amount" of harm in the third case. The regular
                    medical treatment did not "score." The reader, of course, is not to conclude that
                    this was true for all diseases. While quakery, superstition, magic, and sheer humbug constituted
                    far-too-important elements of the practice of the period, and while the treatments can best be
                    described as crude and heroic, there were giants among the medical men of that era and encouraging
                    progress was being made by 1860.
            The planter was ever-mindful of the well-being of his slaves, and the conclusion is reached that the
                    "over-all picture of slave health is simply a picture of health conditions in the 
                        United States
                    , and their health status was no better and no worse than that of the populace as a
                    whole for that period" (p. 164).
            The cataloging of ills and remedies does not lend itself to a smooth-flowing narrative style, but the
                    problems presented by such a study do not excuse such loose writing as the following: "Dr.
                    Philips of 
                        Mississippi
                     stated that on his plantation they churned every day, the Negroes, with the exception
                    of the children, getting all the sour milk" (p. 35); and "Unfortunately, Negro
                    women were not all the traditional born cooks depicted in literature" (p. 37). There are
                    some other slips in writing and in calculations, but they do not detract seriously from the value of
                    this volume to the student of slavery and the antebellum South.

            Too often the interest of the reading public in local history has suffered because of the formal and
                    pedantic style of certain writers. Unfortunately, such dull and uninspiring presentations of local
                    histories have prompted an indeterminate number of readers to turn to the historical novel as a
                    means of satisfying a natural curiosity concerning early local histories. While the results may be
                    gratifying from the standpoint of entertainment, the fact remains that the novel embraces historical
                    accuracy only as a matter of literary convenience. Between these two extremes in the presentation of
                    local history lies the middle ground of offering an informal and interesting history, yet giving
                    proper emphasis to accuracy. Such is the case in this account of the reminiscences of Oliver
                    Johnson.
            In presenting in written form the stories told to him by his grandfather, Howard Johnson has related
                    a seemingly accurate history of the events and situations which attended the earliest settlers of 
                        Marion
                     County, Indiana. The greater portion of the story deals with Oliver
                    Johnson's experiences, observations, and impressions during the second quarter of the
                    nineteenth century. The author's use of dialect in relating this story adds charm to a
                    style which is both smooth and informal. Occasionally, he has employed footnotes for the sake of
                    clarity or documentation. A portrait of Oliver Johnson serves as a frontispiece and a comprehensive
                    index comprises the final pages of this work. Following a brief introduction by the author, there is
                    a map designating the location of those places mentioned in the story. Not only does this map serve
                    as a geographic guide, but also it attests to the accuracy and authenticity of the narrative.
            This thin volume of ninety-two pages represents a definite contribution to the local history of the
                    Hoosier State. The author has succeeded in presenting in a simple yet vivid style a subject which
                    can be summed up in the one word "refreshing." Finally, mention should be made of
                    the contribution of Albert Fessler, nephew of Howard Johnson, and of the officers of the Indiana
                    Historical Society. In a large measure it was their words of encouragement and their general
                    assistance that prompted the writing and publication of this story.

                    and index. $4.00).
            This work is the first history of nursing in 
                        Ohio
                    , and it tells the story of the problems and accomplishments in this basic period of
                    professional nursing and relates the world and national events which affected its development. In
                    the past thirty years a number of histories have been written describing the development of nursing
                    from its earliest manifestations in mother and family care to its present status as the largest
                    profession for women in the world. Only recently, however, has serious study been given to setting
                    forth the story of nursing within the separate states. This is largely due to the fact that nursing
                    as a profession is still comparatively new since nursing organizations, nursing legislation, and
                    educational standards for nursing schools have developed within the twentieth century.
            The first period of this history, from the opening of the Northwest Territory in the latter part of
                    the eighteenth century to the middle of the nineteenth century, may be characterized as one of
                    ignorance, quackery, and superstition in medical science, and lack of facilities for adequate
                    treatment. A few hospitals were established but nursing in the homes or hospitals was the
                    responsibility of the mother, relative, or practical nurse of the community.
            After the turn of the mid-century, religious orders established hospitals in 
                        Ohio
                     and began to furnish some of the nursing service. During this period Florence
                    Nightingale left the battlefields of the Crimean War to return to 
                        England
                     where she formulated the foundations of modern nursing and established the first school
                    based on sound educational preparation for the practice of nursing. It is pointed out that the work
                    of Miss Nightingale in the Crimean War affected the nursing care in 
                        Ohio
                     during the Civil War, and her pattern of nursing education was reflected in the rapid
                    development of nursing schools there in the twentieth century.
            By 1900 the new nursing system had achieved recognition and new concepts of medical science, health
                    maintenance, and hospital care were on the move. Soon, nursing schools were to be found in
                    practically every hospital and nursing home, and the need for standards and licensure became urgent.
                    The 
                        Ohio
                    
                     State Nurses' Association incorporated in 1904 faced
                    many obstacles before securing the first nurse practice act in 1915. The nurses of the organization
                    worked for women's suffrage and the right to serve on the state committee regulating the
                    standards of nursing schools and the licensure of nurses. The nurse examining board functioned under
                    the state medical board until 1941, when the state nurses' board was finally created.
            Events in the first half of the twentieth century present a swiftly moving complex story as nursing
                    schools advanced toward sound educational programs as opposed to the apprenticeship pattern, as new
                    fields in public health nursing, school nursing, and industrial nursing developed, and as nurses
                    faced the problems of military needs during the two world wars. Many nurses who participated in the
                    development of nursing in 
                        Ohio
                     during this period are recognized nationally for their outstanding contributions to
                    nursing. The State now has two well-established autonomous basic collegiate schools of nursing and
                    an outstanding advanced nursing education program. By 1950 thirty nursing schools in the State had
                    co-operative arrangements with seventeen colleges for some of the instruction which indicates the
                    movement toward improved nurse education.
            The final chapter of the book entitled "What of the Future?" is particularly good.
                    It summarizes the present status of nursing in 
                        Ohio
                    , the changing concepts, the reasons for these changes and identifies some of the
                    nursing problems currently faced by the nurses and other citizens of the State.

            Hilton U. Brown is one of the few Hoosiers who have lived in Indiana since before the Civil War. His
                    memory of events, personalities, episodes, and movements, spans a period of almost ninety years. A Book of Memories is an apt title for these recollections of the dean of Indiana
                    newspapermen. This volume is neither history nor autobiography in the usual sense. It reflects a
                    substantial degree of understanding, a generous tone, and even a spirit of youthfulness. The
                    author's apparent conservative leanings are grounded upon a considerable knowledge of
                    human nature. Hilton U. Brown has obviously found  zest in
                    living; he is not unduly sentimental about the good old days, nor does he find only sordidness and
                    corruption in recent years. Perhaps his study of Greek and Roman civilizations—of
                    language, history and literature—gave him a perspective about mankind which has abided
                    with him to his present age of ninety-three.
            This book has many glimpses and sidelights concerning men, incidents, trends, and episodes which will
                    be helpful to historians and others. Many who use this volume will wish its author had told more,
                    while historians will naturally check him against other accounts in accordance with the standards
                    and practices of their profession. These random recollections include useful information regarding
                    college life at 
                        Butler
                    , the establishment of the William H. Smith Memorial Library, the days of mule-drawn
                    street cars in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , the coming of the telephone, ballot-stuffing at elections, Catherine Merrill as a
                    teacher, the location and purposes of the Woollens Gardens, the "literary" names
                    for 
                        Irvington
                     streets, the Sim Coy chapter of boss rule and corruption in the Hoosier capital, the
                    strained relations between Theodore Roosevelt and Charles W. Fairbanks, the editorial ability of
                    Berry R. Sulgrove, the personality of Benjamin Harrison, the establishment and evolution of the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    News, the merger of the former and the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Star, Harvey Wiley as a member of the 
                        Butler
                     faculty, and so forth.
            The memories are principally clustered around three threads: 
                        Butler
                     University, the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    News, and the life of the Hoosier capital. Hilton U. Brown has served on the 
                        Butler
                     Board of Trustees for sixty-nine years, and as president of this body for half a
                    century. He attended the preparatory department at 
                        Butler
                     and was graduated from the college in 1880, when it was located in 
                        Irvington
                    . Since 1881n r for seventy-one years—he has been on the staff of the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    News holding sundry positions from market reporter to Vice-President of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Newspapers, Inc. The association with the News has been his
                    "main beat." His service on numerous boards and committees which have considered
                    or dealt with many aspects or problems of the life of 
                        Indianapolis
                     has marked him as one of its prominent civic leaders. His counsel with many other
                    committees and groups have added to his influence through the decades.
            Mr. Brown has told much about many things, but in so doing he has revealed considerable of himself.
                    None can record his memories of others without telling something about himself. The author deserves
                    an orchid for adding the words  "Permission to reprint
                    granted," beneath the copyright description. Possibly here he WM acting M a newspaper man
                    who wants information to be unfettered and without needless restrictions. Whoever compiled the index
                    should have realized that names alone do not make a satisfactory guide. The book has a certain
                    composite touch—as indicated in the postscript—which may be common newspaper
                    practice, but offers some difficulties by way of interpretation. The generous use of verbatim
                    quotations poses similar problems. Such criticisms, both favorable and unfavorable, are obvious to
                    the careful reader. Hoosiers should be grateful for this further addition to their literature.
                    Perhaps with this beginning Hilton U. Brown will decide to add another volume in order to record
                    more of his memories as he enjoys the years of life beyond that commonly allotted to man.

               The American Veteran Back Home. By Robert J. Havighurst, Walter H. Eaton, John
                    W. Baughman, and Ernest W. Burgess. (
                        New York
                    : Longmans, Green and Co., 1951, pp. xiv, 271. Tables, appendix, and index. $3.50.)
            The project undertaken by the authors of this volume was to present some statistical analyses of the
                    social and economic readjustment of the American veteran of World War II. At least this is the
                    proposition which is posed to the reader.
            An introductory statement that "specific hypotheses can be safely and profitably entertained
                    even though conclusive statistical data may be lacking" leaves the findings uncomfortably
                    in doubt from the beginning. This feeling becomes increasingly more pronounced as many of the
                    tables, most notably in the "Appendix," are judged not reliable by the
                    authors' themselves. Moreover, they say that any application of the findings to a
                    geographical section or the whole of the 
                        United States
                     is left to the discretion of the reader. Certainly the study is of a very localized
                    nature.
            One small city in 
                        Illinois
                     and its environs was selected. From this city a varying number of persons was chosen
                    for each study, the total being 416. Frequently the people under observation numbered from
                    approximately fifty to one hundred for a particular part of the work. For many of the studies,
                    merely the lower socioeconomic groups were the ones concerning whom reports were published.
                    Generally the groups compared were unmarried and married veterans as  well as married non-veterans. Yet there were over fifteen million
                    American veterans as a result of World War II, from all types of background and geographical areas.
                    Parenthetically it is to be admitted that this is undoubtedly a thorough study of "Midwest,
                    Abraham" County, 
                        Illinois
                    .
            Having briefly considered the dubious widespread utility of the statistics presented, the unbalance
                    of the testimonies included in the text is to be noted. The word "unbalance"
                    serves the dual purpose of characterizing many of the interviews individually and all when
                    considered in toto, for a large number of the statements are apparently those of
                    chronic malcontents using the usual colorful G.I. vocabulary. It is also in doubt as to whether
                    these testimonies are quoted or composed by the authors and attributed to others. The example of a
                    field worker meeting a veteran on the street by chance and taking down two pages of conversation
                    verbatim should demonstrate why this doubt arose.
            Another textual criticism is that the material is presented with some misleading or poorly chosen
                    phraseology, similes, and/or concepts. This type of shortcoming runs the gamut from the American
                    Legion, V.F.W., and other such organizations playing a large role in the formulation of the
                    political attitudes of its members, to pronouncements of a more trivial nature such as having each
                    family putting up a service flag for its representative in the armed forces.
            Lastly, it is not clear whether this work was designed for professional or for more popular usage. If
                    the former be the case, then such facts as wives of the lower status being more likely to work than
                    those of the upper status can hardly be classified as "surprising." If the latter
                    be the case, then a more general rule of explanation of statistical and sociological terms could be
                    applied. In either case that which the authors have shown "to be a definite
                    tendency" (as opposed to a phrase such as "proved to be true") is for a
                    great part what is to be expected concerning the matters of readjustment, social mobility, etc.
            It is freely admitted that the forty-nine tables presented are of interest albeit not of definitive
                    and broad applicability. According to the findings noted in this work it can be generally said that
                    in the area studied the married non-veterans have a slight edge in postcwar affairs which would
                    appear to be a sound judgment. Perhaps this volume will prove useful to sociologists as a case study
                    of "Abraham" County.

            George Grove founded the village of 
                        Georgetown
                     in Brown County which took its title from his given name. As the settlement increased
                    in size, a request was made for a post office which was not granted because there was another town
                    by that name in 
                        Floyd County
                    . Consequently, a post village was established and named for the creek in that region,
                    Bean Blossom, five miles northwest from 
                        Nashville
                    . For years this post office has not functioned. Both towns appeared on the early maps,
                    but only Bean Blossom appears on the more recent maps.
            While it was not possible to locate any records about the cemetery plot, some of the older people
                    living in that region claim that Thomas Waltman of 
                        Maryland
                     who migrated to Brown County at an early date donated the ground for the Presbyterian
                    Church and cemetery at 
                        Georgetown
