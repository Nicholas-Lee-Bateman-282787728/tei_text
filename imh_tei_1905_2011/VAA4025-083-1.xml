                    down in an unused ledger from her son's drugstore her memories of growing up on a pioneer
                    farm in the wilderness. In the interim she married, reared a large family, and took an active part
                    in the social and religious life of her community. Her colorful autobiographical sketch, excerpts
                    from which are transcribed below, reveals a child both typical and unusual and a family somewhat
                    unique among northern Indiana pioneers.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    four daughters. Brown had served for a time as sheriff of <placeName>

                    her description of emigrating to, and settling in, the northern Indiana country. At one point she
                    remarks: "Mother had an abundance of good, common sense and a quick, perceptive intellect.
                    She had little knowledge of arithmetic as taught in books, but she could make calculations mentally
                    in a way of her own quicker than we could do with pencil and paper. She would keep all business
                    matters in her head without any tangle. Her sons-in-law esteemed her highly, would tell her their
                    business ventures and ask her opinion. Father never had cause to regret taking her advice but
                    several times repented ignoring it. On the temperence [sic] question she was far ahead of her time.
                    It was her habit to rise at four o'clock and have an hour for private devotion, reading,
                    prayer and meditation.</p>
            <p>"One thing that happened before we moved west illustrated her strength. Seated at her
                    spinning wheel before the fire, awaiting Father's return from a lobbying session in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, she glimpsed a hideous face leering at her through the window. She arose, stepped to
                    the door to fasten it with a wooden button, then went to the bedroom where the children were
                    sleeping. There she dropped to her knees by the side of the bed and commended them to the only
                    source of help that was possible. Then she fastened the back door, drew the curtains and returned to
                    her spinning. Father did not get home that night and there was a large sum of public money in the
                    house, but she was not disturbed. Soon afterward a gang of robbers that had been troubling the
                    country killed an old man who fought for his treasure. At trial one turned state's
                    evidence. Yes, he said, they had been at the sheriff's house, but, because the woman
                    wasn't afraid, they concluded the sheriff was at home. Was it Mother's
                    self-control and composure or was it the Higher Power she trusted that turned away the robbers that
                    night?"</p>
            <p>Sarah's story of her move to Indiana continues: "I know she [Mother] had a great
                    deal of sewing done and we were supplied with clothes to last a long time as we were coming into the
                    wilderness where it wouldn't be possible to hire sewing done and Mother had not been in the
                    habit of doing much of it herself. Many things we couldn't bring were disposed of in
                    exchange for sewing and material.</p>

                    were methods of beating the wool in preparation for cloth manufacture. All of the goods Mother had
                    spun and woven in her early days of housekeeping. She sat us down to rip the quilting, using pins to
                    save the thread which was very scarce. The red flannel made a frock for me and one for Jennette, the
                    blue dresses for Helen and drawers for Father. The wadding of wool bats she carded into rolls and

                    Mother was rather disappointed in finding a comfortable frame house instead of a log cabin which

                    not much variety. There was no orchard in the area and no way of keeping wild fruit except a little

                    ‘Oh, them's just cow punkins,’ the farmer said, and showed him a kind
                    of squash his family used for cooking. We preferred the old kind for pie and Mother even made some

                    to use for dye. One of our best treats was to cut off the top of a turnip and scrape out the inside

                    for my remembrance of our farm life is that it was full of interest. The seasons brought changes. In
                    spring there was plowing and planting, chick-ens, calves and lambs. During haying and harvesting it
                    was for women mostly cooking and washing dishes for a dozen or more men, but we enjoyed that no
                    matter how hot it might be. We took pride in having the best food at such times.</p>
            <p>"I think we enjoyed winters a little more than any other sea-son because the work was not
                    rushing and we had more time for reading and quiet occupations. The long evenings when we read or
                    knitted or sewed or had company were very enjoyable. Father and Mother had candles on the table and
                    we girls usually squatted on the hearth and used the firelight. The big fireplace made a bright
                    light all over the room. When we speak of living by candlelight we must take that into
                    consideration.</p>

                    into a sweat and asleep and the ague was forgotten. We were always cautioned about going out in the

                            marsh and swamp was generally recognized as the cause of the disease; the mosquito was not

                    would have less. At last he came to a girl who said she never had any dough left in her bread

                    got the old cat and dropped her in the middle of the room. The poor thing was dreadfully frightened.

                    of June 15, 1917, is a set piece in American history texts. Although many historians and biographers
                    have written about the trial, none have analyzed the tactics used by Debs's lawyers. Most,
                    in fact, have argued that Debs "offered no defense" except his First Amendment
                    rights; that he "refused to permit his lawyers to conduct a defense"; that his
                    attorneys found themselves with "almost nothing to do"; or that,
                    "following the example of political prisoners the world over, Debs demanded that his

                            other issues. Some writers may have been led into error by Debs himself. A week after his
                            indictment, but before his trial had begun, Debs wrote that he expected to be convicted and
                            that it was only on behalf of his party and "the cause" that he had

                    wrong. Although no one can doubt Debs's devotion to the First Amendment—his
                    defense of it dates back at least as far as 1887<hi rend="sup">2</hi>—the fact of the
                    matter is that Debs's attorneys, presumably with his blessing, used every legal maneuver
                    that they could think of to keep their client out of jail. They tried to take advantage of every
                    loophole and attempted to exploit every technicality. A detailed examination and explication of the
                    legal strategems that the Debs defense used is the first step in a reassessment of the
                    legal—as opposed to the political—history of the case.</p>
            <p>Eugene Victor Debs, it could be argued, courted indictment. At the end of 1917, after Kate Richards
                    O'Hare's conviction under the Espionage Act, Debs wrote to his fellow Socialist:
                    "I cannot yet believe that they will ever dare to send you to prison for exercising your
                    constitutional right of free speech, but if they do, then … I shall feel guilty to be at
                        large."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> His commitment to freedom of expression and his empathy
                    with other Socialist "comrades" indicted, tried, convicted, and incarcerated
                    became almost constant themes. In March, 1918, he denounced the indictments of Adolph Germer, Victor
                    L. Berger, J. Louis Engdahl, William F. Kruse, and Irwin St. John Tucker; argued that the Socialist

                    transcript of Debs's speech, scrawled over with question marks, underlinings, and comments.
                    Wertz set the scene: a picnic on the last day of the convention of the <placeName>

                    with sarcasm to President Woodrow Wilson's war message and to his objective "to
                    make the world safe for democracy." Debs praises the Bolsheviks, denounces the convictions

                    "so is he." At the bottom of page 12: the sentence, "You need to know
                    that you are fit for something better than slavery and cannon fodder." Although earlier in
                    his letter Wertz acknowledged that the Socialist orator had probably not violated Section 3 of the
                    Espionage Act "before it was amended" in May, 1918, he now judged the quoted
                    sentence as a Title I, Section 3, Clause 2 offense under the original congressional legislation.
                    Wertz pointed out that there were in the audience a number of young men of draft age. They heard the
                    speech, listened to the sneers at patriotism, absorbed the emotive words, "slavery and

            <p>Three days later, on June 20, John Lord O'Brian, special assistant to the attorney general,
                    replied to the Wertz communication. "It is highly important," he wrote,
                    "that prosecutions be avoided in cases of this kind which do not violate … [the]
                    express provisions" of the Espionage Act. The Debs "case is not without serious
                    doubts.…" O'Brian noted that most of the passages marked by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> attorney did not "in and of themselves" violate the law. Although the
                    boundary between the legally innocuous opinion and criminality might have been breached in the Debs
                    speech, the Justice Department, O'Brian informed Wertz, was not "strongly
                    convinced" tht a prosecution was advisable. The Department of Justice was not
                    "strongly" opposed to a prosecution either. O'Brian pointed to various
                    sentences from the transcript, as well as to a few of the Wertz citations, that were not
                    qualitatively different from "many expressions on which successful prosecutions have been
                    based." "They tell us," wrote O'Brian quoting Debs,
                    "that we live in a great republic.… They taught you that it is your patriotic
                    duty to go to war and slaughter yourselves at their command.… When Wall Street yells
                    war.…" In fact, O'Brian suggested that if Wertz went forward, he should
                    "make the whole speech a part of the indictment."<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Attorney
                    General Gregory wired six days later advising Wertz that "covering other speeches of Debs

                    language Debs was alleged willfully to have made or conveyed "false reports or false

            <p>The outlines of the Debs defense were in part embodied in the Motion to Quash and the Demurrer to the
                    Indictment filed respectively on August 6 and August 15, 1918, and signed by Stedman, Sharts, and
                    Wolf. Accompanying the demurrer was a memorandum of authorities, and on August 31 a thirty-five page
                    brief on the Motion to Quash and the Demurrer was filed. Taken together, the arguments posed in
                    these papers were technical, constitutional, and comprehensive. Debs's attorneys claimed
                    that: 1) the grand jury had been illegally drawn from the Eastern Division rather than from the
                    entire Northern District of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> without "any public notice or opportunity afforded defendant or the public to
                    be present"; 2) every count in the indictment was "insufficient" and
                    "bad" be-cause the Canton speech "uttered by the defendant" was
                    composed of opinions, not facts; thus, separately and collectively the charges failed to state
                    "an offense against the laws of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>"; 3) the persons named in the indictment were not alleged to have heard
                    "or become cognizant" of the false reports or false statements, and the others
                    "alleged to have been present and alleged to be known to the Grand Jury … [were]
                    not by name or description set forth"; and 4) most importnat of all, Title I, Section 3 of

                    neither was the Socialist party on trial in his case. Debs was similarly situated to a Democrat or a
                    Republican accused of a specific crime and confronted by a juror of the opposite political party
                    with an antipathy toward its competitor. Grant's admitted anti-Socialist bias, therefore,

                    conclusion; what effect they had on the jury is impossible to deter-mine. Stedman conceded that Debs
                    abhorred war; he told the jury that by the end of the trial it would know the Socialist leader
                    "by his works, by the works of his whole life." He pointed out that the transcript
                    of the Canton speech, on which the indictment was based, was incomplete, that it omitted
                    "words and even whole paragraphs." "You would not," he asserted,

            <p>It has been customary in narratives describing the trial to credit Debs with an almost saintlike
                    charity toward those who testified against him. "Mr. Miller," he told the <placeName>

                    done me an injury by testifying against me. You had to do it and you did it like a
                    gentleman." He said to Virgil Steiner, the young Canton stenographer who was hired by the
                    Justice Department, who was not sufficiently skilled to record Debs's speech verbatim, and
                    who left out long passages: "Never mind, sonny, you did the best you could under the

            <p>Cunnea and Stedman, however, were not so kind. During the direct and redirect examination of Miller,
                    they objected nineteen times to questions asked by the district attorney. The cross-examination was
                    often intense and sometimes fractious. It involved in part the conversation in the lobby of the

            <p>Stedman in his interrogations of Miller and Steiner attempted to cast doubt upon the reliability of
                    the testimony of the government witnesses. He was not kind to Miller; he did not commiserate with
                    Steiner. He demonstrated that the speech delivered by Debs in Nimisilla Park was not the speech that
                    formed the basis of the indictment. He showed that the Steiner version was about 75 per-cent of the
                    speech as taken down by Edward R. Sterling, the official stenographer of the Socialist party. But
                    his efforts were futile. Judge Westenhaver overruled both the motion to exclude Steiner's
                    evidence and the objection to Sterling's testimony on grounds of variance; if he had agreed
                    with Stedman, neither form of the speech would have remained in evidence, and the trial would have

                    "with a smattering of knowledge," the champion of the
                    "half-baked" and "the non compos mentis." At Canton, with no
                    patriotic decorations on the stand, with no American flag in sight, Debs poured out "his
                    poison" to a "crowd of cheering and hollering men of all ages." The
                    spectators "did not hesitate to voice their approval of what he said." The man who

                    a punishment would be an abridgement of free speech, but certainly the First Amendment afforded no
                    protection to the accused. The district attorney offered further examples. Debs would say, he
                    claimed, that the man who, against <placeName>

                    punished because he was safeguarded by the First Amendment. Similarly, the person who slandered a
                    woman's reputation would be immune from prosecution. The difficulty with the Debs
                    construction of the First Amendment, Wertz concluded, was that the Socialist knew "just
                    enough about the Constitution and the law to get him in trouble."<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although less dramatic, perhaps the most important part of the Debs trial from a legal perspective
                    was the dispute between judge and defense over the issue of intent. The government had the burden of
                    proof to demonstrate a specific intent by Debs to violate those clauses of the Espionage Act for
                    which he was being tried. Miller's testimony, the calling of Ruthenberg and Triner to the
                    witness stand, the introduction into evidence of the indictments of Ruthenberg and his associates
                    and of O'Hare and Stokes, all were for the purpose of proving intent. Stedman objected to
                    the reading of the Canton speech and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> antiwar program into evidence. He contended that Miller's testimony did not
                    demonstrate what "portion" of the Socialist program, "what paragraphs or
                    what sections Mr. Debs endorsed." He urged, "An intent goes to the method of
                    accomplishing a result.… [It is] the means used to accomplish the executing the motive to
                    carry out." The defense attorney compared Miller's conversation with Debs to a
                    revolver: "If I say I am going to kill a man with a revolver and I repeat it a dozen times,
                    and the man is killed, you introduce it [the revolver] to show what? Intent. The method of
                    accomplishing the execution of the individual whose life I wish to destroy." In
                    Debs's general endorsement of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> platform, however, there was no evidence to show what was in his mind, to elucidate
                    what was his intent. There was "no unqualified approbation or approval of the contents of
                    that document. On the contrary, the evidence shows that there was not such an approval."<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Judge Westenhaver's immediate response was to overrule the objection. He returned to the
                    issue of intent in his instructions to the jury. Debs, he said, contended that by the Canton address
                    he intended merely "to convey information to his fellow citizens of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    judge confused the definitions of the two words by analogizing Debs to the father of a large family.
                    The father steals bread for his starving children and "also to deprive the owner of its
                    value." The father has two motives, Westenhaver stated, one good and one evil, but he is
                    still guilty, "for he law says he may not steal at all."<hi rend="sup">46</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to preserve the distinction between "motive" and
                    "intent," what Westenhaver should have said was that the father had a good motive
                    and a bad intent, words that he did use to characterize the Canton address. Debs made the speech. He
                    may have had a good motive—to convey information—but he also had a criminal
                    intent—to violate the Espionage Act. But good motive is irrelevant; the law says that he
                    may not infringe the congressional proscriptions.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Like all other persons,
                    argued Westenhaver, Debs was "presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of
                    his word and acts." The question in his case was "did he intend or
                    expect" that his Canton address would influence his audience, composed in part of men of
                    draft age. "Ought he not to have reasonably foreseen that the natural and probable
                    consequences of such words and utterances would or might be to cause insubordination, disloyalty, or
                    refusal of duty in the military forces of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    </placeName>? Or to promote the cause of its enemies?" Westenhaver said that as "a
                    part of [his] burdensome and unpleasant task," it was incumbent upon him to hold that the
                    Espionage Act as amended was constitutional; it was the supreme law of the land, enacted to protect
                    the "public peace and public safety during war." The wisdom of passing the
                    Espionage Act was not for him or for the jury to decide; it was their duty "to accept that
                    law from the Court and to apply it." "Disapproval of war," he admonished
                    the jury, "is not a crime, nor is the advocacy of peace, unless the words or utterances
                    … shall be willfully intended by the person making them to commit the acts forbidden
                    … and further, not even then unless the natural and reasonably probable tendency and
                    effect of such words and language … will have the effect and consequences forbidden by

                    of in-subordination in the armed forces, the obstruction of enlistment and conscription services,
                    the incitement to resistance, and the op-position to the cause of the <placeName>

                    jurymen Josiah T. Grant and Charles H. Harris, and to permit James Decker to answer certain
                    questions relating to his view of the First Amendment. It referred, moreover, to the admission of

            <p>With this understanding of its legal duty, the defense, with citations of precedent, complained of an
                    indictment that failed to charge a crime and argued the impropriety of the definitions of
                    "military and naval forces" and "the recruitment and enlistment
                    services" contained in the judge's instructions. They further pro-tested the
                    improper admission of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> platform and of court records in the Ruthenberg, Stokes, and O'Hare cases. For
                    what purpose were the indictments in other cases, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> plat-form, and the testimony of Joseph Triner entered into evidence? Judge Westenhaver
                    had said that it was to demonstrate Debs's in-tent, to explore his state of mind. In the
                    judge's instructions to the jury there was "a reiterated suggestion that this
                    intent could be read into … [the Canton] speech by the jury, from all these other
                    sources, and then read out again as if coming from the language of the Canton speech
                    itself." The Canton address and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> platform were, therefore, "merged into one," and so were intent and
                    motive. Motive, the defense argued, was irrelevant: the "only ‘state of
                    mind’ which comes within the issues of this case is the specific criminal intent to
                    effect the criminal results charged." The brief insisted that "other utterances
                    which do not incorporate themselves in the ‘particular means’ as affecting the
                    Canton audience—can have no application to the issue of intent in this case."<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In solemn and stately language the Debs defense then reached the First Amendment argument.
                    "The millions in many countries who respond to the idealism of Eugene V. Debs, from one
                    angle to another," it noted, "will bluntly speak of the … case as a
                    free speech fight." They will ask: "What degree of tolerance of minority
                    sentiments is to be read out of or into the American Bill of Rights in the year 1919 by the court of
                    the last resort?" Twenty years ago Professor Woodrow Wilson had characterized the origins

               <hi rend="sup">53</hi> Debs's lawyers argued that the guarantee
                    of freedom to object and to agitate was the same during wartime as in peace; it was not diminished
                    by the exigencies of conflagration or heightened by the calmness of peace. War was a crucial subject
                    matter of public discussion. The war just ended had been hotly and bitterly "de-bated in
                    Congress and throughout the country." The verbal conflict might have been divisive, even
                    subversive of governmental purpose, but could not under the First Amendment be deferred until war
                    had run its destructive course for it would then no longer have possessed the "vitality of
                    national immediacy."<hi rend="sup">54</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Debs's lawyers insisted that the speech made to the Canton audience fell within the ambit of
                    the Bill of Rights. Debs hated war, and he spoke against it. He urged his listeners to embrace the
                    Socialist crusade. He exhorted them to enlist in the emancipation of the human race. "Join
                    the Socialist Party [he evangelized]. Don't wait for the morrow. Come now. Enroll your
                    name; take your place where you belong.… You need to find yourself—to know
                    yourself. You need to know that you are fit for something better than slavery and cannon
                    fodder.… You need to know that you are on the edge of a great new world."<hi rend="sup">55</hi>

                    </placeName> affirmed Debs's conviction, the brief continued, it would lend credence to the
                    proposition that the topics of war and of Socialism were unmentionable during wartime. It would
                    demonstrate that the Espionage Act could be used for the purpose of "suppressing during war
                    an exposition and exhortation toward Socialism." The First Amendment stated unequivocally
                    that "Congress shall make no law.…" "No law" meant no
                    law. Either, Debs's defense argued, it "means all that it says … or it
                    means absolutely nothing." It "must be declared in the broad terms of its
                    universal understanding as the primary condition of human progress."<hi rend="sup">56</hi>

            <p>In January, 1919, there was yet another brief submitted to the Supreme Court on behalf of Debs. As
                    amicus curiae, Gilbert E. Roe, the former law partner of Senator Robert M. La Follette, concentrated
                    almost exclusively upon freedom of speech as guaranteed by the Constitution. In his preface Roe
                    noted: "Because of my interest in other litigation involving the same questions as those
                    involved in … [Debs], I am particularly desirous of having called to the attention of
                    this Court those authorities and suggestions which seem to me to bear upon the questions to be

                    <pb n="39" id="VAA4025-083-1-045"/> the views of William Blackstone. The Englishman's
                    definition of a free press as being protected solely against prior censorship makes the First
                    Amendment "utterly useless as a guarantee of liberty." Blackstone died in 1780,
                    eleven years prior to the ratification of the Bill of Rights, and his Commentaries had been
                    completed by 1769. Besides, the English judge also believed in "witchcraft and
                    sorcery" as the "revealed will of God," a fact of "historical
                    interest," along with his construction of the rights of a free press. "There
                    is," Roe argued, "no more reason for accepting his belief about one than about the
                    other as a measure of liberty and freedom in this country today."<hi rend="sup">58</hi>
            </p>

                    interpreted by the courts—protected the federal government, "which really meant
                    the Administration in power, from hostile criticism and condemnation."<hi rend="sup">59</hi> But James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Thomas Jefferson had both repudiated the congressional usurpation of power over
                    speech and press. The Sedition Act was repealed; prisoners convicted under its clauses were
                    pardoned; and fines paid were returned. Congress may have a delegated power to lay and collect
                    taxes, said Roe, but by the First Amendment it may not penalize criticism of the taxing policies of
                    the government. Congress may declare war; it may raise and sup-port an army and a navy; but it may
                    not, without flouting constitutional guarantees, act to quell verbal opposition to war and to
                    conscription. "Our historic freedom of speech and of the press re-mains
                    inviolate," Roe declared. "If the breach" made by the Espionage
                    Act" in the wall of constitutional liberty is not speedily and permanently repaired, it
                    will certainly be enlarged as one exigency after another seems to make it necessary, until the whole
                    structure will give way before the assaults of the real enemies of constitutional and democratic

            <p>Significant in Holmes's decision was the justice's placement of the opinion in the
                    context of the Canton address and the trial, in Westenhaver's instructions to the jury and
                    in the conflict over the admission of testimony and documents. Holmes conceded that Debs's
                    primary intent was to enlist new members in the Socialist cause: "The main theme of the
                    speech was socialism, its growth, and a prophecy of ultimate success." "With
                    that," Holmes wrote, "we have nothing to do.…" Holmes then,
                    however, adopted Westenhaver's theory of intent. The Canton speech was not immunized
                    "if a part or the manifest intent of the more general utterances was to encourage those
                    present to obstruct the recruiting service.…" In short, Debs may have had two
                    intents, one innocuous, one criminal, and "if in passages such encouragement was directly
                    given" he had violated the Espionage Act.<hi rend="sup">62</hi> In the Canton speech Debs
                    alluded to Ruthenberg, Wagenknecht, and Baker, who had been convicted of aiding and abetting Alphons
                    J. Shue in his refusal to register for the draft. Debs had been coy. He stated that he had to be
                    "prudent" and might not be able to say "all that he thought."
                    Nevertheless, he did praise the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> Socialists, and he did laud their efforts "to better the conditions of
                    mankind." Debs discussed and criticized the convictions of O'Hare and Stokes and
                    confessed that if the latter "were guilty, so was he." He had told his audience at
                    Canton: "the master class has always declared wars and the subject class has always fought
                    the battles," and "you need to know that you are fit for something better than
                    cannon fodder." All this, averred Holmes, went to demonstrate the illegal intent of the
                    Socialist leader. And there was more. In his speech to the trial jury Debs had admitted that he
                    hated war in general and the war then being fought "in particular." In the
                    conversation with Miller "an hour before his speech," during which Debs had
                    endorsed the Socialist antiwar program, and again, although his attorney had strenuously objected to
                    its admission, in the address to the jury, the defendant had referred to the <placeName>

            <p>Holmes disposed of the argument that the Espionage Act was unconstitutional on its face by citing as

                    speech and the Espionage Act, the affirmance of conviction revolved around the issue of intent and
                    the admissibility of evidence to probe Debs's "state of mind." Applauding

                    <hi rend="i">Times</hi> called Debs an "enemy" of the Constitution. "How

            <p>The enemy of the Constitution had no such expectations; nor did his attorneys. Nevertheless, on March
                    27 they filed a Petition for a Rehearing, which the court denied four days later without opinion.
                    The petition focused primarily and tellingly on Debs's speech to the trial jury. Insisting
                    that neither his professions of antipathy toward war nor his allusion to the platform were evidence,
                    Debs's lawyers claimed that both were merely expressions of opinion and were simply
                    arguments made during a summation, thus equivalent to statements made by the district attorney in
                    his closing address to the jury. Debs had not taken the witness stand, been sworn, or
                    cross-examined. According to his lawyers, he had acted as his own attorney; therefore, no matter
                    what he said, his remarks should not have been utilized in Holmes's opinion as testimony

            <p>General Josiah Harmar's campaign against the "Indian banditti" along the
                        <geogName>Maumee River</geogName> in 1790 marks a watershed in the settlement of the Old
                    Northwest and also in the evolution of America's military institutions. His expedition, the
                    Constitutional re-public's first attempt to impose its will by offensive arms, initiated
                    four years of warfare on the part of the federal government to halt Indian depredations on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> frontier. It was one in a series of events that led to the Treaty of Greenville in
                    1795, to the abandonment by Great Britain of the forts still held on American soil, to expansion of
                    the peacetime military establishment, and to the permanent widening of the federal role in
                    maintaining the nation's security.</p>
            <p>Harmar's campaign remains, paradoxically, both well known to scholars and in many ways not
                    well understood. This state of affairs does not result from a dearth of information.
                    Harmar's con-temporaries could learn easily the outline of the campaign's events
                    and could infer from scattered but numerous clues the causes be-hind its failure. Since 1790 many
                    more facts have come to light; yet, in spite of historians' familiarity with the
                    expedition, significant aspects of it are still unclear. The campaign's climactic battle,
                    for example, has never been accurately described and to this day remains nameless. Blame for the
                    expedition's defeat has also been varyingly apportioned. Historians have long recognized

            <p>Harmar's reunited force moved again on October 3. Combined, they numbered 1,453 regulars and
                    militia. The army marched cautiously toward the Maumee towns, shadowed much of the way by Indian
                        scouts.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Harmar hoped to catch the hostile Miamis and Shawnees, along with
                    the British and French traders whom he considered "the real villains," before they
                    could evacuate their settlements. Seeking to surprise his enemies, Harmar on October 14 detached
                    Hardin with six hundred men to march rapidly to the main village of Kekionga. The colonel and his
                    troops reached the Indian town two days later but were too late. The Indians and traders had fled
                    just in time, leaving many of their homes in still-smoldering ruins. About noon on October 17 Harmar
                    arrived with the main force and set about the work of destroying the remaining towns and
                        supplies.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                    vegetables and killed a few braves who came too close. Believing he might find and defeat a larger
                    force of Indians, Harmar on October 18 sent Colonel Robert Trotter and a mixed force of three
                    hundred regulars and militia to the northwest on the trail of the fleeing Indian families. Trotter
                    followed the scent for a day, accomplished little, and mistakenly returned to camp that evening.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>Annoyed, Harmar dispatched Hardin on the same errand the next day. During this time the Indians had
                    closely watched the army's movements. Led by the capable chiefs Blue Jacket, Le Gris, and
                    Little Turtle and armed with British muskets, they spoiled for a fight but dared not attack
                    Harmar's camp. Hardin's bumbling on the nineteenth gave them an opportunity for
                    revenge. After marching about eight miles, and having forgotten one of his companies along the way,
                    Hardin led his men into an ambush near the <geogName>Eel River</geogName>. His force had crossed a

                    destruction of the Indian towns and stores and prepared to de-part. They marched out of Kekionga
                    early on October 21, encamping that night at aptly named Nine Mile Run about nine miles from the
                    three rivers. A handful of the expedition's proficient scouts remained behind, posted on
                    the hills south of the <geogName>Maumee River</geogName> to observe the Indians returning to their
                    ruined villages. A scout named Daniel Williams brought word that evening that perhpas 120 Indians

            <p>Hardin learned of Williams's report, and seeing an opportunity to redeem his militia and

                    experienced Indian fighters liked to surround and surprise their foes, preferably at dawn, and make
                    them fight in defense of their homes and families. Such tactics forced the Indians to fight on the
                    whites' terms where the superior firepower and discipline of the soldiers would tell to

            </p>
            <p>Certain facets of the scheme remain unclear to historians, and one suspects that these ambiguities
                    also existed in the minds of the commanders that morning. Who would command the stronger wing? How
                    were the elements of this wing—Wyllys's regulars, McMullan's militia,
                    and Fontaine's horsemen—to maintain contact with one another? Hardin and Hall
                    were to loop around to the left, cross the St. Mary's River, then march through Le
                    Gris's small village to the west bank of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>. They contemplated a hike of a mile or more through hostile woods and fields. How was
                    this to be done without the Indians discovering them, and how were Wyllys and McMullan to know when
                    Hardin had reached his post? What was to be done if surprise was lost? The historian has only
                    informed speculation to supply answers to these and other questions.</p>
            <p>Though apparently sound in principle, then, the Americans<hi rend="sup">2</hi> plan left much to
                    chance and improvisation. It soon went awry. The deponents at Harmar's court of inquiry in
                    1791 testified that Hall and Hardin had almost reached their position when a stray shot alarmed the
                    Indians in Kekionga and sent them scattering. As Little Turtle's braves were seasoned
                    hunters and warriors, it probably would have taken more than one distant, random report to startle
                    them. Surely a flurry of shots erupted. Militiaman Thomas Bourne was with Hardin's corps
                    that morning, and he remembered a pair of Indians firing at his unit as it crossed a
                    "river." Perhaps he meant Spy Run Creek to the west of Le Gris's village
                    and the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>. At least one Kentuckian fell wounded, and the men returned fire and gave chase,
                    pursuing the braves "½ to ¾ mile" to the west bank of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>

            </p>
            <p>Observers agree that the firing alarmed the Indians in and around Kekionga. Wyllys's and
                    McMullan's wing saw them "flying in all directions" from the ruined
                    village. The moment demanded a swift decision, and the commanders waiting along the Maumee agreed
                    that a spoiled plan was better than none. By fulfilling their assigned role they might still trap
                    many Indians as well as sup-porting Hardin and Hall. Accordingly they charged "en
                    masse" out of the woods and down into the <geogName>Maumee River</geogName> ford before
                        them.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Braves on the opposite bank fired on McMullan's men and

                    John Smith, remembered lying bleeding in the shallow stream until the firing stopped, when he
                    dragged himself to cover on the south bank.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Shooting as they came,
                    Wyllys's, Fontaine's, and McMullan's men reached the north bank and

                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>. The regulars held the left flank, McMullan's militia the right, with

            </p>
            <p>The three units advanced together. Before them small bands of Indians fled Kekionga, heading from
                    left to right across the soldiers' front. Scenting victory, the militia gave chase. Less
                    disciplined than the regulars, McMullan's command surely broke apart into knots of men
                    following and fighting the equally disorganized Indians. As they did so, they caused
                    McMullan's side of the sweep line to sheer away, to the right, from Wyllys's
                    advancing federals.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It probably took no more than a couple of minutes for Wyllys and McMullan to lose contact. Neither
                    commander, apparently, heeded the danger this caused; neither halted his men to regroup and redirect
                    their march so as to find the opposite flank. The con-fusion and smoke and noise, the urgency of
                    reaching the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>, and the thrill of finally driving substantial numbers of their red foes before them
                    doubtlessly helped to pull the two flanks apart. Once separated from the militia, disaster soon
                    overtook Wyllys's corps. Veteran Samuel Abbey recalled that the regulars pursued the
                    Indians across "a small prairie" to the edge of a hazel thicket near the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> A small hill or rise, perhaps also covered with hazels,
                    dominated Wyllys's right, and Harmar and others agree that this was where the braves chose
                    to make their stand.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Fontaine's horsemen had accompanied Wyllys,
                    riding ahead of the infantry. Seeing Indians running for the thicket, Fontaine ordered a charge and
                    plunged ahead himself. His men held back, however, and Fontaine was mortally wounded in a hail of
                    musket balls as he sabred a group of braves.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> The horsemen scattered and played
                    no further role in the battle. Militia troops later saw Fontaine's scalped body lying on
                    the battlefield.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wyllys came up too late to support Fontaine, and suddenly his men, too, were raked by a deadly fire

                    Indians, perhaps under the command of Little Turtle, charged or worked forward to fight hand to hand
                    with the regulars. Historian Mann <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>, writing in the 1830s, noted the comparative quiet of this deadly struggle. After the
                    first volley the bayonet, tomahawk, and scalping knife decided the issue.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
                    Wyllys died early, and as the Indians drove the Americans back, one warrior donned the
                    major's big, cocked hat and wore it for the rest of the battle. Leader-less and nearly
                    annihilated, the surviving federals had no choice but to retreat across the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> covered by the muskets of Hardin and Major Stephen Ormsby on the opposite shore. At the
                    river's edge and even in the shallow stream the Indians pressed their assault. Bourne
                    recalled shooting a brave as he tomahawked a blue-coat on the other bank; other accounts told of
                    Indians bayoneted in the running water.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Only a handful of regulars (perhaps
                    nine) survived the battle.</p>
            <p>Why did McMullan fail to come to Wyllys's rescue? Accounts maintain that the militia quickly
                    lost tactical cohesion; yet, the Kentuckians did render some support for a few returned and
                    at-tacked Wyllys's tormentors from behind. For their pains they received a volley from
                    Major Ormsby's militia, across the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>, who had trouble distinguishing white from Indian in the havoc of battle.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Another factor might have been the relative "silence" of the bitter
                    hand-to-hand struggle that Wyllys's men fought. A thicket and a small hill separated the
                    regulars from the bulk of Mc-Mullan's militia, who had fighting of its own to do and could
                    hardly be expected to prevent a rout that the men could neither see nor hear. Whatever the reason,
                    McMullan's force gave Wyllys no significant support.</p>
            <p>The Kentuckians, however, were not idle. They drove a number of Indians before them into the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>. In places the initial plan worked. Hall's or Hardin's men had taken
                    positions on the opposite bank and shot down many Indians when, in desperation, they forded the
                        stream.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Elsewhere the warriors found gaps and crossed unscathed.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> McMullan stayed behind on the east bank. Those Indians who made their way

                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> fought scattered and probably disorganized actions with Hardin's and
                    Hall's militia. Hardin, recalled Bourne, found himself flanked by Indians in the woods to

                    Unharried, they set off on their return march. The fight had lasted from about 9:00 a.m. to

            <p>Harmar learned of the battle about 11:00 a.m. when a breath-less horseman rode into camp with word
                    that the detachment had met disaster. Regular officers testified at Harmar's court of
                    inquiry that panic then swept the militia camp. Harmar ordered Major James Ray of <placeName>

                    go along. With this pathetic force he started, but he had not gone three miles before he met
                    Hardin's men returning with their wounded and, probably, with the remnants of
                    Wyllys's command as well. Hardin bade Ray wait there, and soon Hall and McMullan came up
                    behind. The men reached camp sometime in the afternoon, and stragglers found their way back to the
                    army over the next few days.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

            <p>Fifty or more regulars died in Wyllys's rout, and about one hundred militia fell. The number
                    of militia casualties, observed historian Jack J. Gifford, belied the later attempts of federal
                    officers to paint the Kentuckians as ill-disciplined cowards.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> No reliable

                    </placeName> foreclosed the discovery of this fact in 1790 when he ordered St. Clair to warn the

                    </placeName> of Harmar's approach. St. Clair's letter to Major Patrick Murray of
                    the Royal Army, dated September 19, 1790, confirmed what the Indians already knew-that an expedition
                    would soon march-and relieved the British of worry for the safety of their post.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> They continued to arm and provision their Indian allies and took no diplomatic steps-at

                    The researcher, of course, can only speculate about what might have happened had St. Clair never

                    </placeName>'s counsels to the general reveal the secretary's worries. He urged
                    Harmar to move swiftly, strike hard, and above all, remain sober.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> His anxiety
                    perhaps arose from the fact that Harmar had never commanded a force so large let alone one
                    in-tending to march deep into Indian country. Harmar's officers might have caused <placeName>

                    skills had surely deteriorated in the nine years of peace and frontier duty that stretched between

            <p>John P. Huber, in his doctoral dissertation on Harmar, praised the quality of the
                    expedition's militia officers. While many of the senior commanders had served against the
                    Indians and the British, their performance in 1790 makes it difficult to credit Huber's
                    ac-claim for them.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> Hardin, though unquestionably brave, foolishly led his
                    detachment into the <geogName>Eel River</geogName> ambush (after forgetting an entire company) and
                    withdrew in what was probably unseemly haste at Kekionga three days later. His men disliked and
                    distrusted him.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> At Kekionga McMullan's inability to control his men
                    helped cause Wyllys's rout. Fontaine's impetuous bravado caused his own death and
                    the dispersal of his mounted riflemen at the battle's pivotal moment. These officers
                    demonstrated bravery and spirit but no military genius.</p>

            <p>The principal disincentive to militia enlistments was almost certainly the low pay promised by the

                    disadvantage.</p>
            <p>In addition to these weaknesses, Harmar's force was too large and slow to surprise anyone
                    yet too small and too green to survive against the forces it might have encountered. <placeName>

                    of this figure's accuracy or inaccuracy, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Indians proved in 1791 that they possessed enough strengh to annihilate an army larger
                    than Harmar's.</p>
            <p>The expedition's humble packhorses proved to be another problem. After Harmar's
                    return to Fort <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the general complained to the War Department of horses "lost" and
                    "stolen by Indians." His officers echoed these concerns. The expedition re-turned
                    to the fort with as few as half its original 600-odd packhorses, and by as early as October 22
                    perhaps two hundred had escaped.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> This loss, deep in hostile country,
                    dangerously restricted the army's mobility. Harmar and his officers fretted that the
                    remaining horses, fatigued and probably overburdened, might not last the retreat.<hi rend="sup">61</hi> As they neared Fort <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Harmar distributed some of the army's provisions and baggage among his
                    soldiers to be carried on their backs.<hi rend="sup">62</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why did Harmar's expedition have such problems? The federal government rented the
                    expedition's packhorses through private contractors who, in turn, rented the beasts from
                    their owners. The contracts naturally included a clause guaranteeing the contractors and the owners
                    compensation for horses lost on the march. The "appraisal" for Harmar's
                    packhorses, claimed <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Army Ensign Bartholmew Shamburgh, was so high that it made it profitable, or at least
                    not costly, for the expedition's civilian drivers to "lose" horses.<hi rend="sup">63</hi> Given such an incentive, the drivers evidently connived with militia sentries
                    to allow horses to wander off at night or to be "stolen" by cunning and perhaps
                    invisible Indians. Each morning parties of troops combed the vicinity around their encampment for
                    strays, and Harmar issued repeated but futile orders calling for more vigilance by the drivers and
                        sentries.<hi rend="sup">64</hi>

                    near the horses, would seem just as vulnerable to "Indians" and just as likely to
                    stray; yet, few wandered off. These facts appear to confirm Shamburgh's observations about
                    the packhorses and the drivers' willful carelessness.</p>
            <p>A pair of physical, or geographic, factors must also be noted in an assessment of Harmar's
                    defeat. The crow flies almost 130 miles from Fort <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Kekionga; Harmar's men must have walked and ridden at least 150 miles on
                    their trip to the Indian towns. In his study of Harmar's command Huber asked why the army
                    was not ferried up the <geogName>Great Miami River</geogName> as far as the site of modern
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Piqua</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> Such a trip might have saved time, put the
                    soldiers about eighty miles from Kekionga, and left both men and horses in better shape for the
                    campaigning to come. Water travel (though on what river remains uncertain) was contemplated by the
                    campaign's architects; but <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> informed Harmar that the contractors were to bear the expense if he went by river
                    whereas the federal government would pay if he marched overland.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> This
                    economizing by the administration probably decided the issue. In addition, there was a very early
                    frost in the autumn of 1790. Harmar's journal records the first on October 6. This bothered
                    the general for it meant that the expedition's animals had their forage reduced
                    substantially and earlier than had been foreseen.<hi rend="sup">68</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The historian easily finds causes for the failure of a venture that did in fact fail. It is much more
                    difficult to show what might have brought success. The auguries of failure for Harmar's
                    expedition are so clear that they must have been visible to contemporaries; yet, Harmar suffered no
                    catastrophe (unlike St. Clair a year later), and he argued with some merit that his campaign had
                    attained its objective. How did Harmar avoid the disaster that seemed a likely result of his march?</p>
            <p>One of Harmar's best moves was sending Major Hamtramck with a diversionary force against the
                        <geogName>Wabash River</geogName> tribes. He probably did not conceive this idea-George Rogers
                    Clark had used a similar strategem to good effect before, and St. Clair prescribed it in 1788.<hi rend="sup">69</hi> Original or not, the move distracted the hostile tribes and kept them from
                    combining to attack Harmar. Hamtramck accomplished nothing of positive value; yet, one historian
                    contends that perhaps six hundred warriors remained on the <placeName>

                    rougher reception.</p>
            <p>Harmar's caution also merits praise. Gifford and Huber noted that he was never surprised.
                    The Indians apparently never found an opportunity to assault his camp or his marching columns. James
                    Smith of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, in his treatise on Indian fighting written in 1812, prescribed an oblong
                    "box" as the best order of march in Indian country. In his later analysis of
                    Indian warfare, Mahon concurred. Both authors also recommended encampments set up in such a way as
                    to reply to an attack from any direction. Harmar's orders of march and encampment,
                    published with the proceedings of his court of inquiry, seem close to these prescriptions.<hi rend="sup">71</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though faulted by contemporaries and some historians, Harmar's decision to send a detachment
                    back to Kekionga on October 22 appears shrewd in retrospect. Persuaded by Hardin, Harmar sought to
                    give the returning Shawnee and Miami warriors a check to deter them from harrassing his return to
                    Fort <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The action's overall plan was good. Had it worked, the fight at Kekionga
                    might be remembered as a telling blow to the Indians on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> frontier. The scheme failed because it asked too much of its militia components, but
                    Hardin and Wyllys still inflicted heavy casualties and probably prevented the tribesmen from
                    pursuing the army.</p>
            <p>The evidence also leads one to believe that Harmar recognized the weaknesses of his force and the
                    perils it faced. When the general erred at all, it was on the side of caution. His rapid return
                    march reduced the dangers that his men faced while deep in Indian country. As James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ripley</settlement>
                    </placeName> Jacobs noted in his history of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Army, after marching at least three hundred miles, fighting two battles, and wrecking
                    six enemy towns, Harmar's army re-turned to its base a reasonably cohesive unit.<hi rend="sup">72</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These accomplishments, of course, are hardly proof of military genius. They are merely what should be
                    expected of a competent commander. Harmar did nothing rash, but his sins of omission hang like a
                    cloud over his campaign and, not without justice, were perceived by contemporaries as the proximate
                    cause of the expedition's failure. In addition, historian Richard H. Kohn argues that
                    Harmar must share blame with Governor St. Clair for committing the prestige of the <placeName>

                    understandable, it cannot excuse his undertaking such a dangerous and yet tentative campaign.</p>
            <p>Harmar's generalship failed at several crucial moments. Having reached the Maumee towns and
                    set his army to its labors of destruction, he still sought battle with the Indians. He put his
                    militia troops at considerable risk on October 18 and 19 by sending them far from camp in the hope
                    that they would find and defeat the fleeing tribesmen. Huber asserts—and surely Harmar
                    should have recognized the fact—that the only terms on which the Indians would accept
                    battle at this point was by ambush. If so, why should the army have sought combat with them? To have
                    stood by impotently while the Americans burned their towns would have proved a great embarrassment
                    to Blue Jacket, Le Gris, and Little Turtle. Instead of confronting the chiefs with this dilemma,
                    Harmar foolishly gave them opportunities on October 18 and 19 to beat his troops and thereby to save
                    face. This, combined with the loss at Kekionga three days later, cast the campaign as a defeat for
                    the Americans.</p>
            <p>In their assessments of Harmar's campaign both Theodore Roosevelt and Huber noted that
                    Harmar apparently placed little trust in the abilities of his regular officers and soldiers. Despite
                    his disappointment with the militia, he kept at least 80 percent of the regulars with him at all
                        times.<hi rend="sup">73</hi> Not until October 22 did he trust one of his own
                    officers—Major Wyllys—with command of a detachment.<hi rend="sup">74</hi> He
                    led none of the detachments himself.</p>
            <p>Harmar committed his worst mistake in refusing to return to the <geogName>Eel River</geogName> and
                    Kekionga battlefields to bury the army's dead. His officers later claimed that he neglected
                    this duty of honor after the Kekionga fight because he feared his tired packhorses would not stand
                    the strain. He apparently never considered returning to the <geogName>Eel River</geogName> site at
                    all. On both occasions strong detachments could probably have performed the task of burial in safety
                    without weakening the main camp to the point of imperiling it.<hi rend="sup">75</hi> By not
                    returning Harmar impressed his men with his excessive caution and his seeming disregard for their
                    fates. Inevitably these perceptions festered in the minds of the militia and gave rise to rumors of
                    Harmar's timidity and incompetence. Kentuckian Hugh Scott, a nineteen-year-old militia

                    circumstances of Harmar's campaign and the events of the battle of Kekionga show that
                    failure, while probable, was not inevitable. Had McMullan and Wyllys supported one an-other along

                    Indians' stand instead of scattering themselves, the ill-starred campaign could have ended
                    with a victory. Such a blow to the Indians would not only have boosted American morale and inversely
                    lowered that of the hostile tribes it might even have led to fruitful negotiations.</p>
            <p>When Harmar and his commanders adhered to the tactics and methods found effective by
                    eighteenth-century Indian fighters, they succeeded, or at least they gained potentially decisive
                    advantages over their foes. When they strayed from these maxims, whether through negligence,
                    ignorance, or evil chance, they failed. The army and its officers erred because they had not been
                    taught how not to imperil themselves and their plans. Harmar had time to provide only the most
                    rudimentary schooling to his green troops and to his earnest but less than competent subordinates.
                    In this lies the single most significant cause of the defeats at Kekionga and the <geogName>Eel
                        River</geogName>, and for it Harmar can not be directly faulted.</p>
            <p>Harmar's own mistakes, however, turned bloody but honorable defeat into shameful rout in the
                    minds of his men, his superiors, and his Indian enemies. By needlessly exposing his men to ambush
                    and by refusing to return to the battlefields to bury his dead, he enabled the Indians to boast of
                    victory, and he bewildered and angered his army. His expedition marched homeward wounded and dazed,
                    leaving behind an equally bloodied but exultant foe. Harmar failed to recognize what Leo Tolstoy
                    claims Napoleon under-stood at the close of the battle of Borodino, that he who thinks he has lost
                    has in fact been defeated despite the damage he may have done to his adversary. Not unjustly,
                    Harmar's disregard for the safety and morale of his men cost his country the campaign and
                    himself his career.</p>

            <p>Professor Ronald D. Cohen's recent article on integration of the Gary school system, 1945 to
                        1960,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> interested me both for what it said and what it did not say. I am
                    sure it is a valid presentation of the facts available in the written records, and I agree with much
                    that he wrote. Yet in some respects my memories of that period in Gary are very different.</p>
            <p>In 1955 my family of six moved from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Gary in search of cheap housing near my husband's work place. We found it
                    on the fringe of the Froebel School area, and as a Froebel School PTA member I became deeply
                    involved in efforts to deal with the problems of that school. The major problems we faced were
                    overcrowding, underfunding, and longtime general neglect on the part of the school administration.
                    It was quite apparent to us, and openly discussed at the time, that our problems were compounded by
                    the school board's determination to maintain as much segregation as possible by building no
                    new schools in border areas, only deep in the middle of black or white neighborhoods. The central
                    district, once shared by black and immigrant steelworkers, had grown increasingly black as
                    Gary's population grew, and blacks faced invisible but insurmountable boundaries, trapping
                    them in that small land area. While no new high schools were built after 1945, many elementary
                    schools were built. One way of relieving the pressure at our K through 12 school would have been to
                    build a new elementary school in the Froebel area. It is here that the school administration showed
                    near total resistance to locating a new school <list type="footnotes">

                    the strenuous campaign supported by the Chamber of Commerce to keep local taxes as low as possible,
                    which meant constant reductions in funds proposed for schools. These cuts were felt in a very
                    discriminatory fashion in poorer neighborhoods, including the blue-collar
                    "integrated" Froebel area.</p>
            <p>Now, as a professional historian with a special interest in oral history, I can better sympathize
                    with people I interview who reluctantly agree to talk about their memories of historic events only
                    if I promise to let them tell the <hi rend="i">whole</hi> story, "the way it really
                    happened," as they recall it.</p>
            <p>What "really happened" in the late 1950s in Gary was a grass-roots
                    parents' protest throughout the black area, led by local parent-teacher associations, over
                    school crowding and the school board's failure to exert sufficient initiative in resolving
                    the problem. A significant part of that struggle was a vigorous campaign by the Froebel PTA to force
                    the school administration to build the first school in years in a border area, Norton Park, which
                    was the boundary between a primarily black neighborhood and a mainly white area.</p>
            <p>When I joined the Froebel PTA, my neighbor, Irene Wilczynski, was president of it. All the executive
                    board members were white. Only when her term expired, did I learn that this school, which had been
                    touted as the glowing example of integration in Gary for years, had had two PTAs, one black, one
                    white, until after the school strike of 1945. At that point they had merged into one PTA with an
                    alternating leadership, a black executive board one year and a white one the next. When
                    Irene's term expired, some of the black parents approached her, saying they felt one reason
                    the school suffered so much neglect was because there was no continuity of leadership in the PTA.
                    Even though it was their turn to lead the PTA, they asked Irene to remain on the executive board and
                    asked the PTA to end the alternating white-black leadership. This was agreed to, and Irene remained
                    on the board as vice-president. Richard Davis, a black parent of many Froebel children, was elected
                    president; Bernice Terry, also black, was elected recording secretary; and I was elected
                    corresponding secretary. Two other board members were Mrs. Wade and Mrs. River Dee Trimble, both
                    black. The years that followed constituted the true beginning of my higher education.</p>
            <p>Froebel School became so crowded that the first four grades were put on half-day shifts. Portables,
                    World War II quonset huts, were added to our campus. Rental property was used, and in spite of this
                    some children housed in Froebel's main building had their desks in one of the larger halls.
                    Class sizes were large. I recall that my second grader was in a class with forty-five students, and
                    the same teacher who taught all their subjects in the morning had an-other group of similar size in
                    the afternoon. In some of the white <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-083-1-073"/> middle-class areas rental
                    property was being used to maintain full-day classes with much lower class sizes, in one case as low
                    as twenty students per class. None of the Froebel children were allowed to take their books home
                    because the books, too, were used by two sets of children.</p>
            <p>Our first efforts to change this situation began with a visit to Superintendent Alden Blankenship to
                    complain about conditions. On our first visit he was friendly but insisted that the neighbor-hood
                    was so congested no immediate improvements could be made. He suggested that when neighborhood
                    redevelopment began there would be land available for a new school in the area. Fortunately we
                    checked with the redevelopment commission to get an estimate of the length of our wait, and they
                    told us there were no prospects of such redevelopment in our area in the forseeable future.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, through contacts with other PTA parents at the city PTA meetings, we learned that
                    this congestion prevailed throughout the black area. Roosevelt PTA leaders told us they, too, had
                    been told no relief was possible but had gone to the city engineer's office and asked him
                    to find a possible school site. He found one; they went back to the school board and, with pressure,
                    were able to get a new school built in their area. We decided to try the same tactic, but since our
                    area was more congested, the only possible site the city engineer could find was Norton Park, which
                    at that time was on the extreme north edge of the black community.</p>
            <p>This was followed by more visits—to the school superintendent, the mayor, the school
                    board, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Midtown
                    Businessmen's Association, the Gary Urban League. The mayor advised us to persist in
                    pressuring the school board. They were the ones who should solve this problem, and as he said, much
                    to his later regret, "It's the squeaky wheel that get's the
                    oil." The NAACP and Midtown Businessmen's Association offered us moral support.
                    From one of the men at the Urban League we received some practical advice on strategy. We were
                    contemplating a petition campaign. He urged us to first persuade numerous local organizations to
                    pass resolutions of support, to send letters to the newspapers, and then to make the petition
                    campaign our grand finale.</p>
            <p>Our relations with the school board and Superintendent Blankenship quickly became less cordial. Chris
                    Retson, president of the school board, frequently told us he could see no solution for our problem
                    except a pied piper to lure away our numerous children. While he obviously considered this a form of
                    friendly banter, it was ill-received by Froebel parents who felt our children were, in fact, not
                    valued by the city leaders. My husband suggested we might receive a more respectful hearing if we
                    took a few precinct committeemen along on our next visit. A friend of his, a leader of Local 1010 of
                    the Steelworkers Union, Bill Young, was married to a <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-083-1-074"/> woman who
                    was extremely active in local politics, and Mrs. Grace Young agreed to accompany us on our next trip
                    to the school board. Mrs. Carrie Irving, another black precinct committeewoman, also joined us. They
                    were older women with no small children in school, but both were very motherly, concerned women.
                    When they appeared with us at our next meeting, Mr. Retson got up, offered one of them his chair,
                    and the foolish banter ceased.</p>
            <p>When we suggested Norton Park as a possible school site, Dr. Blankenship informed us it would be
                    unthinkable to take park space but said they had discovered another possible site, some property
                    owned by the railroad south of 15th Street (right in the middle of the black area). The price had
                    originally been a quarter of a mil-lion dollars, but since the school had expressed an interest in
                    it, the price had unfortunately doubled. Also the railroad refused to build a bridge over some
                    tracks, which would be necessary. How-ever, he added, the city could condemn the property. There
                    were many problems, nothing could be done quickly, but as long as any other possibility existed, we
                    must forget about park property. Certainly Dr. Cohen was correct in his article in pointing out that
                    a program of integration based on a neighborhood school policy, combined with residential
                    segregation, permits a community to espouse the principle of integration while avoiding its
                    substance. The establishment of a school in Norton Park was a real threat to this arrangement. The
                    vigor with which it was opposed suggests that most community leaders had never committed themselves
                    to any-thing more than this comfortable fiction.</p>
            <p>In the face of our persistence, Dr. Blankenship became increasingly testy, suggesting that our
                    children were really getting the basics, just missing the frills, and that if we insisted on having
                    them in school and out of our homes for the full normal school day he might oblige us by running two
                    complete shifts at Froebel, one starting at six in the morning and the second one ending at six in
                    the evening. Our committee had agreed in advance never to make commitments of any kind without a
                    full discussion with our whole PTA. He appeared quite startled when we said we would have to discuss
                    that proposal before we could agree or turn it down.</p>
            <p>If he was startled, Froebel teachers were dismayed that we might even consider such a proposal. Some
                    of the best, most dedicated teachers I have ever known taught in that school, both black and white,
                    and many of them had given the PTA encouragement and needed information. We never expected them to
                    teach such a schedule, but we dared not tell them so at the time. The white parents in our PTA were
                    well aware, from discussions with friends outside the area, that the white community in general did
                    not really believe conditions at Froebel were that bad. Black parents were convinced they knew and
                    did not care. We all agreed that more publicity could only help our cause. We informed our
                    principal, the <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-083-1-075"/> school board, and all our friends in the citywide
                    PTA that this suggestion had been made to us and that we would seriously consider it. We pointed
                    out, however, that the children from one section of our school area would have to walk through the
                    worst vice area of the city before or after dark and as responsible parents we would feel obliged
                    either to organize parent patrols to accompany them or ask for special police patrols in the area.
                    Therefore we could not accept or reject this proposal until we had time to investigate the
                    possibilities. In the process of "investigating the possibilities" we managed to
                    let many more people know how serious the situation at Froebel School really was. I doubt if this
                    proposal ever appeared in any official records. It was probably never intended by Dr. Blankenship as
                    a serious one, but we knew, from past experience, that had we rejected it we would be accused of
                    caring only about getting our children out from under foot and not about education since hints of
                    that nature were frequently made during our discussions.</p>
            <p>We decided to approach the park board directly to discuss the possible use of Norton Park. The head
                    of the park board, Griffith Rees, informed us that he had no use for the school board. The park
                    board had, at one time, requested the use of some land the school city owned for a soccer field.
                    They had been refused, and there had been no cooperation between the two boards since then. We
                    explained to him that we, too, had little use for the school board but were unwilling to let our
                    children pay the price for their poor relations. Why not, instead, let us build a school in the park
                    and insist on a quid pro quo in the nature of a soccer field on some other piece of school property?
                    In fact, why not let us use only one end of the park and insist that the school city allow the park
                    board to use the school recreational facilities in return? Rees found the suggestions appealing and
                    promised to take them up with his board.</p>
            <p>A new reason why we should not have the park was soon discovered by the school administration. A
                    small wooden building in one end of the park was used as a school for the physically handicapped
                    children. Suddenly we were portrayed as greedy parents who would help ourselves at their expense.
                    Our PTA made suggestions about busing some of our children to less crowded schools or changing
                    school boundaries. Again the same response. We would make those schools overcrowded, too. Some of
                    the nearby white schools were already renting extra property to keep their class sizes within
                    reason. We were told any changes would damage other schools or other people, and we must be patient
                    until either redevelopment or the railroad property brought us some relief.</p>
            <p>The parents of the handicapped children were easy to deal with. We called them and told them we
                    needed the park but we did not want to leave them without a school. Would they consider becoming
                    part of our school if we could get one built in the park? They, too, were an
                    "integrated" group and rejoiced at the prospect of any <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-083-1-076"/> support from anyone. They had their own horror stories about the
                    difficulty they had had in finding even the ramshackle park building and getting any kind of
                    schooling for their children. Attending school with non-handicapped children would benefit their
                    children. What they really needed was a new building with ramps and therapeutic pools. Shortly after
                    we made allies of those parents, the small wooden building in the park burned down. It was suggested
                    an irate Froebel parent might have started the fire. Froebel parents either replied that tramps were
                    known to hang out in that area or that God, in the interests of justice, had struck it by lightning.
                    At any rate the handicapped children had to be housed some-where, and we promptly demanded they
                    share a new building with us in the park. Ramps and therapeutic pools, as well as cooperation with a
                    park recreation program, were added to our demands.</p>
            <p>One of the park board members lived just a block north of Nor-ton Park, as did Irene Wilczynski and
                    I, and we soon heard this man was blocking the proposal at the park board by promising the entire
                    neighborhood would rise up in protest, possibly even precipitate another race riot similar to the
                    one at Froebel in 1945. It was time for a new step in our PTA drive for support.</p>
            <p>Throughout this period various community groups had sent resolutions to the school board urging them
                    to let us use the park for a school unless they found another real solution. Our letters regularly
                    appeared in the letter column of the Gary <hi rend="i">Post-Tribune</hi>.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> A
                    petition campaign in the black area was producing large numbers of signatures. Now Irene and I were
                    told we must canvass our white neighbors on the edge of the park and get as many signatures from
                    them as possible. We felt defeated before we started. Most of our neighbors were Catholics who sent
                    their children to parochial schools, and we were sure they would be against us. In this case we were
                    the ones who were guilty of prejudging people wrongly. There was racial bias aplenty, but there was
                    also a sense of fair play that we had not counted on. That ambivalence in white blue-collar workers,
                    which Robert Coles has so well documented in his study of <placeName>

                    confidence or understanding, we managed to appeal to the better side of most of our neighbors. We
                    were pleasantly surprised at the amount of support we received. Even the few refusals were polite.</p>
            <p>There was one exception. Three-quarters through my block I knocked on one door to be greeted with a
                    hostile harangue. It soon <list type="footnotes">

                    son who had just moved out of the area. Flushed with success by that time, I told him all the young
                    parents would be forced to move unless we got a school soon, adding that people who were so hostile
                    to blacks they would deny their own grandchildren a decent education had no cause for complaint. At
                    that point he grabbed my petition, scrawled his name on it, and slammed the door in my face. Only
                    when Irene and I compared notes, did I learn he was the father of one of the leaders of the racial
                    strike at Froebel in 1945. Had I known who he was, I would have passed his door without knocking.
                    With his signature along with all the others on our petition, our neighborhood park board member was
                    left with little support for his opposition. He became ill and did not attend any park board
                    meetings until after the park became securely ours.</p>
            <p>With park board leaders growing more and more receptive to our demand for a new elementary school in
                    Norton Park, it became increasingly difficult for the school administration to continue their
                    refusal. We were still in the position of making all the proposals to both park board and school
                    board while they continued to decline to talk to each other. In desperation we finally attended a
                    city council meeting en masse to insist that the mayor call the two groups to a joint conference to
                    discuss our proposal. The entire council chambers were filled with Froebel parents and parents from
                    one of the black schools, who were also there in large numbers protesting conditions in their
                    school. Mayor George Chacharis was irate! The parents were adamant, speaking out of order when he
                    declined to call on them, and the local newspaper carried the story on the front page.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> By this time the whole city had heard that unless some relief was immediately
                    forthcoming our entire school would be put on half shift through the eighth grade and there would be
                    little peace in Gary if that happened. The following day Superintendent Blankenship formally
                    requested the park for a school.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Within a week the park board and school board
                    came to an agreement to build the Norton Park School,<hi rend="sup">6</hi> complete with ramps and
                    therapeutic pools for the handicapped children and with special provision for park programs to be
                    carried out there as well. We were told by a local, forever to be unnamed, political leader that
                    Congressman Ray J. Madden had flown in from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> to tell the local Democratic leadership to give us the park school before we wrecked
                    their next election.</p>
            <p>These are my recollections of the school situation in Gary in the late 1950s, aided by a few
                    newspaper clippings and numerous <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-083-1-078"/> notes taken at the time. I well recall that PTAs in many of the
                    black schools were as actively protesting overcrowded conditions as we were. We frequently met at
                    the same civic meetings and always the issue of discrimination in the distribution of school
                    resources was a shared complaint. Frequently changes in school boundaries were suggested to
                    distribute the misery more evenly. Because of the neglected condition of Froebel School, which was
                    Gary's show-case "integrated" school, however, Gary parents never enjoyed
                    the illusion that integration alone would achieve parity. It was clearly understood in Gary, as it
                    was not in many other communities, that both class and race were bases for discrimination.</p>
            <p>In the 1960s there were continued demands for both equal and integrated education. One took the form
                    of the law suit discussed in Cohen's article. Another was a "Freedom
                    School" conducted primarily by the Gary NAACP under the leadership of Jeanette Strong. The
                    Gary NAACP was revived when Mrs. Strong, whose husband was a leader in the steelworkers'
                    union, became NAACP president. At that point not only the school system but also local hospitals and
                    businesses were vigorously challenged on issues of discrimination.</p>
            <p>The Freedom School, a one-day school boycott, I remember especially for two reasons: Dick Gregory and
                    the Tolleston High School track team. The school administration scheduled a city track meet for the
                    same day as the school boycott, and the boycott organizers feared many of the high school students
                    might choose to attend the track meet. Bernice Terry assured everyone that she had personally talked
                    to the Tolleston track team, the one expected to win most of the honors at the track meet, and they
                    had promised to attend the Freedom School. They did, walking in as a group exactly at the minute the
                    school was scheduled to start, wearing their letters and a look of pride and dignity that made them
                    seem much older than they were.</p>
            <p>Parents assisting at the school were apprehensive about the lunch hour. Although there was food and
                    drink for all, it involved some long lines, and many of us had experienced a good deal of unruliness
                    in our schools between classes. Dick Gregory spoke to the students just before lunch. He was still
                    regarded primarily as a comedian with a strong social conscience. His full potential as a social
                    reformer had not yet been realized, but it was apparent that day. Gregory simply transformed those
                    youngsters. He talked to them about responsibility and maturity. He praised them for having achieved
                    more of both than many adults ever do by making a choice to attend the school, and he spoke of the
                    importance of persistence, the importance of small choices made all day, everyday. The lunch lines
                    were totally quiet, totally peaceful, and the cleanup committee had nothing to clean up when lunch
                    was over. It was a rare moment in a parent's life!</p>
            <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-083-1-079"/>
            <p>I remember the court case and the efforts of the NAACP attorneys to prove, what to me is still an
                    obvious truth, that the school city had continuously and systematically built schools in such a way
                    as to create a segregated system. I was not too surprised at the outcome of the trial because the
                    kind of evidence required to prove such a case in court is not the kind that people in the 1950s
                    left lying around in the records.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Terry was the only member of the Froebel PTA to testify at the trial, and she was put on the
                    stand only on the spur of the moment to fill in a bit of time needed by the NAACP lawyers. One of
                    the bright moments of the trial for the NAACP side occurred during her testimony. The school
                    board's attorney was trying to make the point, which Cohen referred to in his article, that
                    they could not change the school boundaries in the manner suggested by the NAACP because it would
                    endanger children by forcing them to cross railroad tracks. He asked Mrs. Terry if one of her
                    children would not be forced to cross a track and if she did not fear for the child's
                    safety. She pondered the question a moment and replied that she did fear that track crossing, but
                    then she added, if half the children in another (overcrowded) school had to cross the same track a
                    few blocks further away as they had done for years, her child might as well risk his life for a
                    chance to go to a better school. This small mother of seven children appeared so innocent in her
                    re-marks that the lawyer walked into two more traps before he finally realized he was talking to a
                    woman who knew much more about Gary school boundaries than he did.</p>
            <p>It was the breaking of residential barriers that finally led to real change. Blacks, who by the 1960s
                    were well over half the population of Gary, had been bottled up in about one-sixth of its territory
                    so long that the boundaries simply would not hold. They began to move into new neighborhoods and new
                    schools. But these changes came about after a revitalized local NAACP chapter finally gave a united
                    focus to black discontent and after several years of vigorous school protests at the grassroots
                    level of the community.</p>
            <p>A continuing problem, one of whose major symptoms is this endless competition among neglected groups
                    for better opportunities for their children, still remains to be addressed by the nation as a whole.
                    That is the failure of leadership at all levels, local, state, and federal, to place the needs of
                    children in general high on their list of priorities—their needs for education, support,
                    and protection. Facing up to this one, if we do it, will undoubtedly change our society even more
                    than the 1960s.</p>

            <p>I am most grateful to Professor Elizabeth Balanoff for allowing my article to jog her memory
                    concerning school segregation in Gary in the late 1950s. Her comments are most valuable, not only
                    be-cause of her direct participation in the events under discussion but also because of her vast
                    knowledge of the history of the black community in Gary, the topic of her doctoral dissertation at
                    the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. She has the right combination of experience and training, and she has added a valuable
                    perspective to my understanding of school issues in Gary.</p>
            <p>Professor Balanoff's detailed memoir once again demonstrates the value of using oral history
                    to add to the written record. While I did interview a few people who were directly involved in the
                    issues under discussion, I was not sufficiently aware that many others were involved at all levels
                    of school politics. Much of what she remembers never appeared in print because these discussions and
                    negotiations took place in private meetings. More importantly, the usual focus is on the actions of
                    school administrators and board members because their activities most often appear in the

                    case through the structure of the Froebel PTA, are usually overlooked because they are much less
                    visible. Perhaps Professor Balanofl's most important contribution is not to note that
                    school segregation was still an issue in the 1950s but that the parents, at least at the Froebel
                    School, were heavily involved, <list type="footnotes">

            <p>One other point, I certainly agree with Professor Balanoffs conclusion that both race and class have
                    been the basis for school segregation and discrimination. Poor white as well as black children
                    shared inadequate, overcrowded facilities. The problem was not only money—although the
                    resistance of big business to school tax increases was telling—but also the distribution
                    of resources. Despite these problems Professor Balanoff and the other parents had great faith that
                    schooling was important for their children and that they could influence administrative decisions
                    and outcomes. And, to an extent, they did. Her memoir is a valuable addition and correction to my
                    basic understanding of schooling in Gary, Indiana, in this most formative period.</p>

                    make a judgment about what to include and what to exclude based on an acquaintance with great
                    numbers of general and local histories stretching back through the luxuriant era of subscription
                    volumes; biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, and justifications; the assiduous gleanings of
                    fledgling and employed Ph.D.s; scholarly and not-so-scholarly articles in journals of varying
                    quality, and so on in amazing variety. The prospective readership is equally difficult to define. (I

                    and readership well and has competently delivered on his promise: "I have tried to give
                    Indiana's history the serious treatment it deserves, often sacrificing romantic stories and
                    colorful vignettes for analysis" (p. xv).</p>

                    </placeName> studies to all Jewish communities throughout the country, neglecting significant

                    </placeName> Jewish community contributes substantially toward correcting this distorted

                    </placeName> Jewry from 1849 to the present is her belief that to understand properly the American

                    Always, the Jewish community has remained small, amounting to 1 or 2 percent of the state's
                    population. Even when the large wave of Jews from eastern Europe washed ashore at the turn of the
                    century, only a trickle arrived in Indiana. For all these contextual reasons Jewish life in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> has been different from that in more cosmopolitan, eastern, industrial centers, but it
                    has never been isolated from the problems and trends that have affected Jews elsewhere.</p>
            <p>In 1901 the Industrial Removal Office, which was sponsored by the Baron de Hirsch Fund, sought to
                    relocate in less populated areas the Eastern European immigrants who were congregating in port
                    cities on the east coast. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was among the destinations selected. To meet the newcomers' needs for social
                    assistance, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> community organized a Jewish federation to coordinate, centralize, and professionalize
                    social work as federations did elsewhere. Jewish Hoosiers greeted the impersonal, agency approach
                        <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-083-1-086"/> to charity as a mixed blessing at best because it interfered
                    with the friendly, informal network of voluntary associations under local leadership with which the
                    community preferred to meet its social responsibilities.</p>
            <p>The Hoosier Jews also preferred to handle external threats in a manner consistent with. the size and
                    influence of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> community. During the 1920s Jews throughout the country were a target of the Ku Klux
                    Klan as well as other nativist groups. Jews in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> were fewer in number and felt more vulnerable to the threat than their east coast
                    co-religionists. They did not hesitate to resist the Klan, but more often their response was a
                    quiet, firm refusal to be intimidated, accompanied by restrained political counter-pressure rather
                    than loud, public protest.</p>
            <p>Endelman carries her story well beyond the peak period of immigration. She describes in admirable
                    detail the response of the community to the Holocaust, the founding of <placeName>
                        <country reg="is">Israel</country>
                    </placeName>, and postwar suburbanization. Throughout the volume Endelman places what is going on in

                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1884. It covers chronologically in both text and pictures the history of
                    the area from the Indian presence to 1984. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hammond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, located in the north-westernmost part of the state, is Indiana's sixth
                    largest city and has been primarily known for its industry and manufacturing. Trusty, professor of
                    history at Purdue University Calumet, is well versed in the history of the region. His previous
                    publications include <hi rend="i">Town on the Ridge: A History of Munster, Indiana</hi> (1982) and
                        <hi rend="i">The Calumet Region: A Master Bibliography</hi> (1985).</p>
            <p>Although photographs comprise the bulk of the book, Trusty has written a popular, yet intelligent,
                    thoughtful, and readable history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hammond</settlement>
                    </placeName> based primarily on secondary sources and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hammond</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Times</hi>. He has successfully avoided turning the work into either a nostalgia
                    scrapbook or a sanitized Chamber-of-Commerce-style history, a fate which befalls all too many
                    anniversary <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-083-1-087"/> histories. While this book will certainly appeal to
                    those who wish to look back nostalgically on the good old days (I found myself yearning for a
                    Maid-Rite hamburger), Trusty looks at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hammond</settlement>
                    </placeName> realistically and is not afraid to deal with some of the less positive aspects of the
                    city's history such as labor disputes, black/white relations, and the decline of the
                    downtown shopping area. A few minor errors are to be found. The Orpheum Theater was on State Street
                    not Hohman Avenue, and Edison School was not closed in 1981.</p>
            <p>The author has carefully chosen pictures showing many aspects of life in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hammond</settlement>
                    </placeName>—work, recreation, education, social life, religious life, and organizations.
                    Pictures are well reproduced and clearly identified. Trusty's captions are informative,
                    descriptive, and often humorous. Unfortunately, the photographs for the post-World War II period are
                    few in number and among the least interesting in the book although the text is thorough and
                    up-to-date. There are a few too many photographs of individuals and school groups; and more
                    nonphotographic sources such as advertisements, broad-sides, and prints would have been preferable.
                    Those that do appear in the book are very effective. More maps would also make it easier for
                    readers, especially nonresidents, to follow parts of the text. A map showing the railroad routes,
                    which were so central to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hammond</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s development, or the exact location of important landmarks that are now gone,
                    like the State Line Slaughterhouse, would have been helpful.</p>

            <p>This is a loving portrait of one of Indiana's oldest and most famous high schools.
                    Shortridge was organized as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> High School, the city's first, in 1864. During the rest of the century its
                    facilities were gradually improved, and the school finally moved into a large building in 1905, a
                    few years after adopting the name of Abram C. Shortridge, the city's superintendent of
                    schools in 1864. From the beginning the school developed a strong academic reputation and highly
                    qualified faculty. As Laura Sheerin Gaus proceeds <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-083-1-088"/> through the
                    decades, she discusses various illustrious teachers, sports achievements, student activities, noted
                    alumni, literary accomplishments, administrative decisions, and other matters concerning the
                    day-to-day functioning of the school.</p>
            <p>Early high school teachers were often accomplished scholars as well as versatile teachers who took
                    upon themselves a variety of roles. The well-remembered Laura Donnan, for example, taught six
                    classes, including history, civil government, political economy, Latin, and geometry; she also read
                    proof for the student daily newspaper, the <hi rend="i">Echo,</hi> served as principal of the night
                    school, man-aged the girls' basketball team, presided over the Senate, and much else. Not
                    all had such a crushing load, but it was necessary for everyone to serve in a variety of capacities.
                    Many of the long-lived teachers became institutions, including Charity Dye, George Huffard, Angeline
                    Carey, and Roda Selleck. For teachers and students success followed success, particularly under the
                    rule of principal George Buck. Shortridge moved into its final home, a glorious structure, in 1928.</p>
            <p>Change, inevitably, came in the 1960s. The school became progressively more black although it
                    remained integrated until its closing in 1981. Shortridge also lost some of its academic luster
                    although Gaus continues to list student academic, as well as athletic, accomplishments. And the
                    building disintegrated. Without an adjacent residential area, which was long gone by the decade of
                    the '60s, the school was finally judged unnecessary by the school board.</p>
            <p>Basing her work almost exclusively on material in the year-books and student
                    newspaper—long a daily—as well as letters from and interviews with alumni,
                    Gaus stays close to her sources. The numerous photographs add significantly to the detailed
                    discussion of school life. This is not a critical study, however. There is no analysis, based on
                    reading in the secondary literature, of such topics as the changing curriculum, the evolving nature
                    of the student body, or the impact of the depression, World War II, and Sputnik, to name but a few.
                    Must reading for all alumni, it adds little to an understanding of the larger meaning and role of
                    the high school in American society. Shortridge was mostly a highly academic school that appears to
                    deserve the nostalgic sentiments of its former students and teachers.</p>

                    </placeName>, Ind.: Purdue University Press, 1985. Pp. xiii, 212. Illustrations, appendix,

            <p>In his book Hoosier Home Remedies Varro E. Tyler documents an important part of Indiana's
                    medical history—folk medicine. By <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-083-1-089"/> utilizing folklore
                    materials, published histories of folk cures, and the techniques of oral history, Tyler has amassed
                    over 750 home remedies. He has organized and presented these remedies according to the disease state
                    that they were purported to cure, and in a commentary section under each physical condition he has
                    noted the relative popularity of these cures, as well as their actual therapeutic value. The author
                    also includes an appendix of botanical and scientific names and suggestions for further reading.</p>
            <p>Tyler has approached the study of folk cures from the viewpoint of a pharmacologist rather than a
                    historian. While his commentary on the actual therapeutic value of these domestic remedies is
                    interesting, Tyler's presentation of the material unfortunately adds little to the
                    much-needed scholarship on the subject of Hoosier home health care. The author has relied mainly on
                    the techniques of oral history in his research, thus ignoring many primary sources such as letters,
                    diaries, newspapers, almanacs, and agricultural journals that would have offered a wealth of
                    information about the home remedies employed throughout Indiana's history. Further-more,
                    the author makes no note of which remedies were unique to a particular ethnic group or to a
                    particular region in Indiana. From a historical perspective Tyler's work would have been
                    far more interesting and useful had he taken these factors into account.</p>
            <p>Tyler's book will undoubtedly be popular among the general public, who will be entertained
                    by a number of the home remedies included in this collection. One remedy for influenza, for example,
                    was to have the patient drink whiskey until he or she saw two hats. Fresh cow manure applied to cuts
                    on the feet was purported to aid the healing process. A recommended salve for cancer was made by
                    placing a toad in a quart of unsalted butter, sealing the container, and placing the container in
                    the hot sun for several days. Even as a popular book, however, the work has some problems.
                    Tyler's encyclopedic style of listing the cures makes for difficult reading. Moreover, by
                    excluding those remedies connected with superstition and myth, the author has eliminated some
                    fascinating material. Finally, despite the author's warnings about the more dangerous
                    remedies, some readers may be tempted to try some of the cures since the presentation of the
                    material ironically resembles that of an early domestic remedy book.</p>

            <p>New books that analyze various aspects of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal continue to
                    appear. The subject is seemingly inexhaustible; <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-083-1-090"/> yet, as greater
                    perspective has been gained over the years on the New Deal at the federal level, historians have
                    turned to an examination of its state and regional impact. In his <hi rend="i">Hard Times and New
                        Deal in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                        </placeName>, 1929–1939</hi> George T. Blakey of Indiana University East has provided
                    a valuable contribution to the state studies. Buttressed by impressive research in a variety of
                    primary and secondary materials, Blakey has written a competent, straightforward account of the
                    impact of the depression and the New Deal on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. He has generally succeeded in producing a well-written and enlightening narrative and
                    in giving his readers a good introduction to the subject. The book is competently edited and well
                    designed; it is enhanced by excellent photographs.</p>
            <p>After a brief introduction Blakey presents in the first chapter an overview of the depression in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. This chapter is followed by six others that discuss the impact of the New Deal in such
                    areas as banking, relief and public works, youth, agriculture, industry, and politics. A brief
                    concluding chapter attempts a survey of the New Deal legacy in the state.</p>
            <p>Blakey makes a valiant effort to discuss the human impact of the New Deal while analyzing the
                    economic data; nevertheless, at times the reader is numbed by facts and figures. The chapter on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> youth and the New Deal is the most successful in maintaining a balance between analysis
                    and human interest. At times the author seems to spend too much time discussing the New Deal in
                    general before bringing the narrative down to the state level. The chapter on state politics during
                    the New Deal, perhaps the best in the book, might well have been the second chapter instead of the
                    seventh in order to provide the reader with the political con-text of events at the outset. Some
                    efforts at analyzing the economic impact by county or area within the state might have helped
                    readers understand the data more clearly.</p>
            <p>Reviewers should resist the temptation to criticize authors merely because they have not written
                    their books as the reviewers themselves would have written them. The fact is that, the above
                    reservations aside, Blakey has written a good book that is a significant contribution to

                    presentation as well. The development and maturation of steam power in a variety of industries over
                    a century and a half involves many individuals, several types of engines, and a multitude of
                    technical problems. Hunter chose a thematic approach with ten chapters each dealing with a specific
                    topic. Given the complexity of the subject, this is a logical and appropriate solution. While the
                    first chapter, "The Beginning of Steam Power in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>," serves reasonably well as an introduction to the book, there is no attempt
                    to pull the various subjects discussed together in a synthetic conclusion. Such an essay would have
                    been very useful, given the richness of Hunter's research. Similarly, some explicit linkage
                    of this volume with that on water power and the projected third on electrical power would have been
                    desirable. These essays, of course, may have been planned since for all the richness of the
                    scholarship displayed in the two volumes they are only part of the work he projected. The separate
                    chapters are excellent, richly embroidered essays by a mature scholar reflecting the insights of a
                    lifetime.</p>

                    book's power. Both organizations deserve thanks for a job well done. Their care and
                    commitment to publish this work in its present form has given readers a great scholarly work that is

            <p>The title of this work is promotional flim-flam, but the subtitle is accurate except that the author
                    rambles through nine chapters <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-083-1-092"/> of background before reaching
                    1790. Wiley Sword offers a richly detailed account of the clash between the Indians of the Great

                    </placeName> valley and the advancing Americans. Although the broad outlines of the struggle are
                    well known, from the defeats suffered by Josiah Harmar and Arthur St. Clair to the decisive victory
                    of Anthony <placeName>

                    descriptions of the rigors of frontier life. Both sides fought with occasional cruelty, and the
                    author recounts many stories of torture with gory particulars. He also makes a determined effort to
                    give the Indian view of the conflict, and the Miami chief Little Turtle is clearly as much a hero as

            <p>Unfortunately the faults of this work far outweigh its merits. The publisher claims that this is the
                    first thorough history of the topic, but Sword slights James R. Jacobs's <hi rend="i">The
                        Beginnings of the U.S. Army, 1783–1812</hi> (1947) and never mentions Richard H.

                    minor errors is merely annoying, but closer examination of the notes at the end of the text raises
                    very serious doubts. With rare exceptions the references give only page or document numbers with no

            <p>A careful study of Sword's text and citations demonstrates that he lacks a proper
                    understanding of the fundamental historical principle of critical evaluation of the sources. He uses
                    any item that suits his purpose, no matter how remote from contemporary documents or how unreliable.
                    He accepts the notoriously fraudulent captivity narrative called <hi rend="i">The Remarkable

                    war chief "Gush-gush-a-gwa" is in fact a political attack on Secretary of War
                    Henry Knox. Editorial lapses are numerous and annoying, from misnumbered footnotes to a prophetic
                    army officer who diagnosed a "viral infection" (p. 169) a century and a half
                    before the discovery of the virus. Loyalists serving as British Indian agents are denounced as
                    "American defectors to the British side" (p. 125), and St. Clair is accused of
                    failing to appease the "left wing" of the Indian confederacy and turning it into
                    "a moderate Indian faction" (p. 67).</p>
            <p>Sword is a military enthusiast whose previous work concerned the Civil War. With proper editorial
                    advice his interest in this earlier period might have been turned into a useful narrative. As
                    published, it is highly detailed but filled with errors and often based on untrustworthy sources.
                    The maps are mere sketches without even a scale of miles. The mystery of the book's
                    publication deep-ens with the absence of two essential scholarly works from Sword's

            <p>Political parties were the preeminent institutions of nineteenth-century American politics. They
                    mobilized voters, selected candidates, developed or innovated policies, delivered material benefits
                    to supporters, and controlled legislative policymaking. John F. Hoadley seeks to identify the
                    origins of these influential organizations. Pre-Revolutionary parties, as he briefly suggests,
                    represented aristocratic factions. The founders of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> despised this form of party; yet, Hoadley finds, Americans quickly evolved functioning
                    congressional parties. Why, he asks, did par-ties emerge in an antiparty environment?</p>
            <p>Hoadley uses literature from political science to hypothesize a four-stage continuum of party
                    development from factionalism to polarization, expansion, and institutionalization. An evaluation of
                    the continuum thesis then follows. First, the author's survey of in-formation on electoral
                    institutions (chapter 3) convinces him of the nonexistence of the political structures necessary for
                    expansion of parties to the masses and for party institutionalization (organization, leadership)
                    prior to 1803. Then, he devotes much of the remainder of the book to an examination of the shift
                    from factional to polarized politics and the development of party identification by <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-083-1-094"/> the national elite in Congress. Using multidimensional scaling, a
                    statistical technique allowing for the spatial representation of the votes of members of Congress,
                    he describes the shift from disparate factions to this polarized association of the members by 1803.
                    Next, he uses spatial representation of selected roll call votes to define the issue basis for
                    factions and polarized blocs. At this stage an exploratory use of regression analysis is utilized in
                    a unique effort to plot vectors to indicate the direction of support for each issue. Although this
                    procedure is at best an estimation technique that must be cautiously referenced, it helps illustrate
                    the increasing degree of polarization on assorted issues within Congress.</p>
            <p>The weakest part of Hoadley's effort is his final chapter. Here he attempts to associate
                    selected independent variables with the dependent variable of the pattern of factions and polarity
                    in congressional voting. Very briefly, with oblique reference to his data, he suggests that
                    variables such as issues, sectionalism, and the personal alliances of the boardinghouse do not
                    explain the development of cohesive voting blocs in Congress. Instead, he implies a structural
                    explanation. According to his brief sketch of this explanation, the polarization of Congress is
                    associated with an independent executive. The development of policy positions by the executive
                    forces a choice of support or nonsupport of the executive on Congress. Members thus polarize into
                    blocs and develop a party identity. Unfortunately, the author does not use any historical evidence
                    to elucidate how the blocs developed a party identity. Also, he fails to explore why a united
                    opposition appeared and why the support of the executive was important for members of Congress.</p>
            <p>Despite these caveats there is still much of importance in this book. It helps sort out the
                    dimensions of conflicts over political issues in the early republic. It directs attention to the
                    importance of national elites in the formation of American parties. It suggests a need to examine
                    the effect of political structures and constitutional arrangements on the evaluation of parties.
                    Finally, it indicates that hypothesis testing can improve scholars' understanding of
                    historical change.</p>

            <p>In this unusual book Richard H. Zeitlin presents the history of "Old Abe," the
                    eagle mascot of the Eighth <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> Volunteers of the Civil War. Old Abe's career is in itself remarkable and
                    worth recounting in the midst of the current renaissance of interest in <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-083-1-095"/> the Civil War, but Zeitlin also uses the bird's story as a
                    vehicle for a number of other stories. The book is, therefore, a veritable potpourri of mid- and
                    late nineteenth-century history with the eagle as the unifying force.</p>
            <p>A Disney Studio writer could not improve on the true story of Old Abe. Born in rural <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, the eagle was originally captured by Chippewa Indians in 1861 and traded to a farm
                    family for a bushel of corn. Adopted by the newly raised Company C of the Eighth <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> Volunteers, the eagle went to war and participated in the long and hard service of that
                    regiment. Returning to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> after the war, he became a pet of the state and a genuine national celebrity and
                    traveled widely as a feature of patriotic meetings and conventions until his death in 1881.</p>
            <p>The eagle's story is, of course, inextricably connected with the story of the Eighth <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>. The book, therefore, contains a regimental history of that organization. Its marches
                    and battles are included, as are the details of the common soldiers' lives and the
                    incredible hardships of their service. Also recorded are biographical sketches of a number of the
                    officers and enlisted men of the regiment.</p>
            <p>Old Abe's postwar career is then recounted, and this story leads to an account of the
                    activities of the veterans in that era, activities with which the eagle was intimately associated.
                    Because the post-war veterans' organizations were in the forefront of Republican
                    "bloody-shirt" politics, these, too, are described. Adopted by the
                    veterans' groups for this purpose, in the author's words, "Old Abe became
                    a perfect symbol of nationalistic Republicanism, a living version of the Bloody Shirt" (p.
                    80). The eagle's involvement in the centennial celebration of 1876 permits the author to
                    describe that episode of Americana. And because all of the postwar events touched by the eagle took
                    place during the heyday of American Victorian-ism, the reader grasps the flavor of that sentimental
                    and colorful time.</p>
            <p>The book contains a number of fine photographs of the eagle and the events and people with which the
                    book is concerned. These enliven the text significantly. Zeitlin is a professional historian and a
                    careful and deep researcher, as his copious citations attest. He is also a graceful writer,
                    thoroughly at home in Civil War history and the period and events about which he writes. Replete
                    with information and insights, this book is an excellent exposition of its several themes.</p>

            <p>Early in this work K. Austin Kerr reminds his readers that the prohibition movement in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> was directed against <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-083-1-096"/> "the liquor
                    traffic," not against the individual consumer or abuser of alcohol. The name of the
                    nation's most powerful prohibition organization, he points out, was the Anti-Saloon League,
                    "not the Anti-Liquor League or Anti-Beer League" (p. 2). This distinction is vital
                    to Kerr's study for, in his view, the league must be under-stood as a progressive reform
                    organization that fought a uniquely successful battle not against individual weakness but against an
                    industry perceived by many Americans to be a social menace.</p>
            <p>Kerr's history begins with an examination of the liquor business and the unsuccessful
                    political efforts of dry organizations in the 1880s. It then traces the evolution of the Anti-Saloon
                    League from its origins in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> in the 1890s to its national campaigns for "local option laws" and
                    the Eighteenth Amendment and finally into the difficult period of the 1920s and the
                    league's decline. Kerr at-tributes the league's remarkable victories to a number
                    of factors: the inability of distillers and brewers to take seriously and work together against dry
                    reformers; the general optimism of the progressive era; the excitement surrounding World War I; and
                    most significantly, the league's innovative system of organization and political strategy.</p>
            <p>Unlike the Women's Christian Temperance Union and other groups, the ASL "was to be
                    like a modern business firm, bureaucratic and not democratic" (p. 81). It employed
                    specialized departments to streamline operations; state chapters were operated by full-time paid
                    superintendents and carefully selected governing boards; all important decisions were made by a
                    small group of men who headed the national office. The league was organized by congressional
                    district and supported local candidates of any party who could be counted on to support the dry
                    cause. Kerr contends that the league provided the model for the modern single-interest political
                    action group.</p>
            <p>In general this is an extremely valuable, thoroughly researched book that makes extensive use of
                    surviving ASL papers and reveals for the first time the activities and strategies of the
                    organization most responsible for bringing about prohibition. There are, however, several
                    weaknesses. First, there is no attempt to de-scribe the rank-and-file membership or to analyze the
                    social basis of important ASL electoral victories. Second, the chapters on the period after the
                    passage of the Eighteenth Amendment are weakened by their narrow focus on the internal struggle
                    between <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> Wheeler's "coercive" approach and Ernest
                    Cherrington's "educational" strategy concerning the problem of law
                    enforcement. Kerr appears to suggest that the league and perhaps even prohibition itself might have
                    survived if only dry leaders had not been so divided. Third, Kerr draws the rather startling
                    conclusion that prohibition "worked" (p. 276) because consumption rates of alcohol
                    were lower in the years after prohibition than they had been before. If <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-083-1-097"/> prohibition had worked, the league would not have lost within a few
                    years the considerable political influence which had made the Eighteenth Amendment possible.</p>

                    Their Great Adventure was short, influencing lives rather than shaping them. The pace of events from
                    induction through training to combat was too hectic to allow much time for introspection. The war
                    ended anticlimactically. The nation had only begun to pour its strength into Europe's
                    battlefield by November, 1918, and had neither triumphs nor tragedies to compare with the Marne,
                    Verdun, or Passchendaele. The "Matter of America" furnished material for only the
                    first chapters of an epic. Awareness of that fact may have been as important as the abrupt postwar
                    return to normalcy in discouraging completion or publication of personal experiences that even to
                    their authors seemed callow when compared to those of Robert Graves, Henri Barbusse, or Ernst
                    Jünger.</p>

                    the British for training. Lawrence experienced the Ypres salient at perhaps the quietest time in its
                    history, the summer of 1918. His initiation to trench warfare was interrupted by his selection for
                    officers' training school. Two months later, a newly minted second lieutenant, he joined
                    the 113th Infantry of the 29th Division.</p>

                    evokes the last true infantry-man's war. Lawrence and his platoon fought in isolation,
                    without radios to provide information or call for support, without tanks and fighter-bombers to
                    clear the way, with artillery whose fire control was so haphazard that it hindered as much as it
                    helped. Lawrence's narrative invites comparison with Charles Macdonald's World War
                    II junior officer's classic, <hi rend="i">Company Commander</hi> (1947). It also
                    demonstrates the limits of open warfare and offensive tactics in the conditions of 1918. The courage

            <p>To rediscover a fine artist, to dust off years of neglect, and to restore him to the position he once
                    occupied are among the great pleasures of art scholarship. Thanks to Rena Neumann Coen, professor of
                    art history at St. Cloud State University, Alexis Jean Fournier can now be added to the list of
                    rediscovered. In this fully illustrated, well-documented account, Coen tracks the painter from his

                    </placeName>, Indiana, in the 1920s.</p>
            <p>Coen relates a romantic tale, and the urbane and intelligent Fournier emerges as a likely hero.
                    Lacking an artistic background and inspirational masters or masterpieces in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Minneapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and armed with only the rudiments of formal training, Fournier progresses from a sign
                    writer in 1883 to a full-fledged artist in 1888. He makes the requisite pilgrimage to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1893 for his first formal training at the Academie Julian where he comes under the
                    influence of Henri Harpignies, the inheritor of the pastoral landscape tradition founded by
                    Charles-Francois Daubigny, Camille Corot, and Charles Emile Jacques. Fournier returns home in 1895
                    armed with sixty canvases glowing with French atmosphere. The French side of his patrimony dominates
                    the next twenty years as six return trips to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> continually restoke the fires. Fournier becomes much more his own man when he stops
                    going to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, gets out of his studio, loosens his brush stroke, confronts nature with his own eyes,
                    and applies his considerable talents to the hills of western <placeName>

                    </placeName>. It is disappointing that the book goes dry at this point. Only thirteen of the
                    ninety-nine pages and eleven of the eighty-three color illustrations cover the last half of his
                    sixty-year career.</p>
            <p>Fournier's is a true midwestern success story, told cautiously by Coen who relies heavily on
                    the only readily available primary source material, that found among the clippings of the
                    artist's scrapbook. Unfortunately, this dependence on articles from a tub-thumping local
                    press leads inevitably to bias in favor of the home- <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-083-1-100"/>
                    town-boy-made-good. To suggest that Fournier's accomplishments are singular achievements
                    does the artist a disservice and raises him to a position that he cannot maintain. In fact, his
                    experiences are not terribly different from those of his two friends from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> days, Adolph Shulz and Adam Emory Albright, with whom he entered the Indiana scene of
                    the 1920s.</p>
            <p>Not only was Fournier not an isolated phenomenon, in many ways he was the stereotypical midwestern
                    artist of the last quarter of the nineteenth century. His remarkable metamorphosis from advertising
                    drudge to brilliant painter was repeated by many regional artists. Although this pattern of success
                    satisfies a nostalgic notion of a rustic, isolated, unsophisticated Midwest, it is proving to be a
                    myth. In <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Minneapolis</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
               </placeName>, and every other city and sizeable town, there
                    appears in the 1880s a core group of art enthusiasts whose zealous purpose was to bring culture to
                    the prairie. Their art societies led to art exhibitions, art schools, art collecting, and art
                    museums in short order. Local artists were the direct beneficiaries of this new interest. Fournier,
                    like T. C. Steele and William Merritt Chase before him, counted on this local patronage to finance
                    their study abroad, and many artists returned home to its reembrace. As a result of such patronage
                    the possibility of remaining close to home and painting familiar scenes was open to the midwestern
                    artists for the first time.</p>
            <p>Coen's study of Fournier adds an intriguing chapter to the story of this midwestern artistic
                    context. For the artist himself, it is the first rather than the last word.</p>

                    valley created the need to adapt the river to the changing needs of the inhabitants of the area. The
                    decline of the white pine industry cleared the way for the development of electric power through the
                    construction of a hydroelectric plant at Keokuk, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>. This project, which provided electric power for a broad area <pb n="95" id="VAA4025-083-1-101"/> including <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>,
                            <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
               </placeName>, also backed the river up
                    nearly sixty-five miles and resulted in a number of unanticipated consequences. These consequences
                    led to public controversies over the failure of the dam to provide power at cheaper rates, the
                    interpretation of the meaning of conservation, and the growing concern of scientists over the impact
                    of the dam on the river's aquatic habitat. Scarpino also describes the formation of the
                    button industry, which led to studies by the Bureau of Fisheries that identified the impact of
                    modernization on the river.</p>
            <p>The degradation of the environment of the upper <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName> led to the
                    founding of the Izaak Walton League, which was the leading force in establishing the Upper
                        <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName> Wild-life and Fish Refuge and the major proponent of
                    legislation to protect the river environment. The rapid expansion of this organization and its
                    widespread influence was due to the dynamic leadership of Will Dilg whose public relations campaigns
                    resulted in improving water quality and an expanding membership. The Izaak Walton League and the
                    Bureau of Fisheries became the major proponents of preserving the water quality and aquatic habitat
                    of the river in the face of extensive drainage of land and increasing pollution of the river.</p>
            <p>By 1930 twenty-six locks had been constructed on the river to improve navigation. An unanticipated
                    consequence of these locks was the formation of pools which became collectors of sewage and erosion
                    from upriver. The response of the cities that produced the pollution depended on their proximity to
                    the stench of the pools.</p>
            <p>Scarpino's thoroughly researched volume is a welcome addition to the slim list of books on
                    the upper <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName> region in the period after the Civil War. It is
                    especially valuable because its insights from the past will help readers both to understand current
                    environmental issues more clearly and to identify issues that are of significant importance to the
                    quality of life on the upper <placeName>

            <p>Collections of essays typically face four potential problems: lack of originality, lack of focus,
                    unevenness, and confusion over audience. Too many of these compendia include essays that have been
                    "published elsewhere"; given modern copying techniques, such works are essentially
                    redundant no matter how creatively edited. <hi rend="i">Festschrifts</hi> in particular share the
                    second problem; they are held <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-083-1-102"/> together only tenuously by some
                    connection to "the great mentor." All scholars are aware of the
                    reviewer's favorite "collection cliche": "The essays are uneven
                    in their quality." Finally, many editors are woefully unsure of their audience: expert or
                    undergraduate? doctoral candidate or generalist? (Few scholarly collections ever dare aim at the
                    layperson.)</p>
            <p>Fortunately, <hi rend="i">American Choices</hi> largely overcomes these problems. For this work the
                    editors specifically commissioned nine original essays from leading scholars concerning the recent
                    American past. Moreover, the essays are tied to a coherent theme—social and economic
                    impacts on policy decisions since 1960—and each serves as an interpretative overview of
                    basic problems, tensions, and trends rather than a foray into arcane original research. The essays
                    are also basically uniform in quality, style, and coverage in spite of the multitude of facets
                    included: poverty, civil rights, the women's movement, education, nuclear issues, the
                    national economy, eneregy transitions, America and the world economy, and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> generation.</p>
            <p>There is some minor confusion over audience, more the result of modern educational disparities than
                    the fault of the editors. Specialists will find little in these essays that is new or surprising,
                    while some generalists may have rough sledding with the sections on economics. First-rate graduate
                    students and weak undergraduates may react similarly. The work is probably best suited for use with
                    upper-level undergraduates and master's candidates. One only hopes that the publishers will
                    bring out a paperback edition of this fine collection for such courses.</p>

            <p>At a time when the superpowers appear unable to limit the nuclear arms race, Charles DeBenedetti has
                    put together a useful book, <hi rend="i">Peace Heroes in Twentieth-Century America,</hi> that
                    recalls earlier opponents of war and its grim devastation. Religion, a commitment to social justice,
                    and abhorrence of war unites these peace heroes, who deserve respect although many failed to halt
                    the wars they feared.</p>
            <p>The peace advocates are a diverse lot. Jane Addams moved from concern about the poor community
                    surrounding Hull House in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> to efforts to end World War I. Indiana native Eugene V. Debs broadened his horizon from
                    railroad workers to workers throughout the world and urged working Americans to avoid killing <pb n="97" id="VAA4025-083-1-103"/> their brother workers in other countries, hence landing Debs in

                    weapon of overwhelming destruction. A. J. Muste served as a conscience for the peace movement until

                    his abhorrence of war and distrust of government with a desire to affect the course of government
                    actions, especially during the debate for the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963 and the

                    </placeName> shortly thereafter. Martin Luther King, Jr., saw the movement for civil rights
                    inexplicably linked with and retarded by America's conflict in Indochina. And the
                    Berrigans, Daniel and Philip, justified more violent antiwar opposition from their view of God and
                    morality.</p>
            <p>The essays are mostly well written and informative. The introduction at times uses phrases and
                    concepts beyond the comprehension of many college students, and some of the essays are less well
                    researched than others. Still, by bringing together antiwar opponents from the twentieth century and
                    recounting their stories, the book's strengths outweigh its rather slight weaknesses.</p>

            <p>The intent of this book is to show the mutual utility of genealogy and social history. The editors,

                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, are both experienced public historians and are well versed in this subject. Their
                    cogent introduction states, accurately, that "the volume familiarizes the reader with
                    highlights of past and present genealogical activity, gauges genealogy's strengths and
                    weaknesses as a reservoir of personal data, and provides examples of genealogies [and genealogical
                    methods] employed in serious historical inquiry" (p. xiii). They also provide a first
                    chapter that includes a brief history of genealogical practice in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, as well as a very helpful bibliography embedded in the footnotes.</p>
            <p>Besides Taylor's and Crandall's opening chapter, the book includes fifteen others,
                    some of which have appeared previously in <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-083-1-104"/> print or as papers. A
                    clearer indication of their provenance would have been useful, but this is a minor flaw.</p>
            <p>Samuel P. Hays's "History and Genealogy: Patterns of Change and Prospects for
                    Cooperation" deservedly appears as chapter two although it first appeared in <hi rend="i">Prologue</hi> in 1975; in various ways Hays defends his statement that "the new social
                    history is simply the new genealogy writ large" (p. 47). John W. Adams and Alice Bee
                    Kasakoff, anthropologists, usefully compare genealogies from primitive societies with those of the
                    present day. Robert Charles Anderson pleads for the acceptance of genealogy as a true auxiliary
                    discipline and for more formal graduate courses. Elizabeth Shown Mills debunks several myths about
                    southern genealogy, most of which ignore the substantial black-Indian-white mixing that existed.</p>
            <p>Chapters six through sixteen are case studies. James M. O'Toole gives a well-informed survey
                    of Catholic records available in the <placeName>

                    better-known parish and diocesan records. Andrejs Plakans evaluates <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> local records and includes a good description of the village genealogies called <hi rend="i">Ortssippenbuecher</hi>. In chapter eight Dean L. May and co-workers verify the

                    $18.95.) Walter T. Durham's work is a narrative history that focuses primarily
                    on Andrew Johnson's administration of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and various events—soldier riots, arrests of prominent citizens, nearby
                    military actions—during the period from the city's fall in late February, 1862,
                    to late June, 1863. (Durham plans to write a second volume covering the period July, 1863, to July,
                    1865.) Though some information about economic dislocations, citizen attitudes toward the occupiers,
                    brothels, and the creation of temporary hospitals to care for the wounded from area battles is
                    included in this work, it contains little social history and little analysis of any kind. Still,
                    Durham's narrative contains much interesting information. Perhaps the most puzzling thing
                    about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s occupation, as it is portrayed in this book, is the relatively low level of
                    violence committed by soldiers and citizens and the absence of really severe oppression by the
                    occupying forces. <hi rend="i">Thomas E. Rodgers, Indiana University, <placeName>

            <p>The bicentennial anniversary of the signing of the Northwest Ordinance on July 13, 1787, will be
                    observed during a summer conference on the Franklin College campus, Franklin, Indiana. Historians,
                    folklorists, and scholars in the arts will give presentations July 10 and 11, 1987, during
                    "Pathways to the Old Northwest." The conference is being sponsored by Franklin
                    College in cooperation with the Indiana Committee for the Humanities. Conference planners hope to
                    reach teachers, students, amateur historians, and others interested in the Old Northwest legacy.
                    Program participants will include Paul Finkelman, William J. Eccles, Reginald Horsman, and Malcolm
                    J. Rohrbough. Registration for the conference will begin in early February. For conference
                    information persons may contact Dr. Lloyd A. Hunter at Franklin College, Franklin, Indiana 46131 or
