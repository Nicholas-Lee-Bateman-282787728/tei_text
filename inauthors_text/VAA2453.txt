                    From a sketch made on the day our great annual coal strike was settled until
                        the next time.
                
                
            
        
        
            
                These Days
                
                A peck o' trouble hain't t' be mentioned in th' same breath with a quart.
                Practically all th' fishin's done by folks that don't need 'em.
                General Apathy has put more men in office than all th' silver tongued orators put
                    t'gether.
                Henry Ford hain't only made millions, but think, too, o' th' great fortunes that
                    have been piled up by th' makers o' Ford adjuncts such as shock absorbers,
                    starters an' boudoir caps.
                "Th' Democrats are so shiftless," complained ole Niles Turner t'day. "They didn'
                    even git one good, full campaign out o' th' world war, while th' R'publicans
                    have been capitalizin' th' rebellion fer over fifty years.
                
                Ther hain't any more purtier girls t'day than ther ever wuz. Ther skirts are only
                    shorter.
                It's jest about got so we can't find a place t' park an' see a the-ater show all
                    in one evenin'.
                When anything does happen t' come out all right it's jest like findin' it fer th'
                    pessimist.
                "Well, if he had any good qualities we'll prob'ly hear about 'em now," said ole
                    Niles Turner t'day, when he heard Tipton Bud's father wuz dead.
                We might as well git ready fer th' long, dull, stringy interval between bobbed
                    hair an' enough t' do up.
                
                If you watch th' face o' th' feller you're talkin' to you kin nearly allus tell
                    when t' quit.
                Th' feller that marries these days may know what kind o' ankles he's gittin', but
                    he's takin' a long shot on th' face an' disposition.
                "We may buy a litle coal t' use in case o' sickness, but th' engine keeps our
                    sedan het up jest fine," says Mrs. Art Beasley.
                Miss Fawn Lippincut didn' register this fall cause she couldn' remember how ole
                    she wrote she wuz last fall.
                Eatin downtown is growin' more'n more general as women become more'n more
                    "enlightened."
                
                Th' feller that waits fer th' right girl t' come along these days is goin' t' git
                    confused.
                Pustmaster Art Smiley, who tried t' stir up enough p'litical enthusiasm t' stage
                    a torchlight procession, is still in th' asylum.
                Where wuz all th' money when we didn' have autos?
                We don't have t' dress like a corpse t' be good.
                A woman is th' blamedest thing. She'll kill her husband's vote an' then turn
                    right around an' charge a new hat t' him.
                
                
                    JANUARY
                    
                    We kin recall when a mother-in-law wuz a liability, but t'day she's one o'
                        the modern conveniences.
                    
                    Th' best of all th' more daylight move ments is washin' th' windows.
                    Hain't it a grand an' glorious feelin' t' come t' a blocked street that we
                        kin cross with impunity?
                    "It's goin' t' be fierce t' jump out of an auto when long skirts git all th'
                        rage," says Miss Tawney Apple.
                    We counted forty-nine autos, averagin' $1,800 apiece, parked around th'
                        courthouse t'day, an' we kin remember when if a feller bought a phaeton he
                        wuz suspected o' havin' inherited th' money.
                    So fer th' political cannydate haint thought o' anything t' catch th' woman
                        vote 'cept an occasional shave.
                    
                    An occasional crisis is a fine thing t' show up th' side steppers.
                    Democrat Alvin Bentley, who's workin' in th' pustoffice under civil service,
                        says he'd git married if he had a steady job.
                    Some folks are so lazy they have a new auto delivered.
                    Th' difference between a good sport an' an easy mark is scarcely
                        discernible.
                    Two homely people allus seem t' be so genuinely glad t' git t'gether.
                    
                    Nobuddy kin listen in if you say it with flowers.
                    Most folks jest won't say "nominated" instead of "anominated" even after we
                        tell 'em about it.
                    Th' new janitor o' th' courthouse used t' be an editur till fortune smiled on
                        him.
                    Banty Kite, who's seein' th' world in th' reg'lar army, is still lookin' at
                        Fort Harrison.
                    Ther's no waste t' a dime's worth o' liver but th' thumb.
                    
                    Somehow sickness or a late train never seem t' keep a tiresome speaker from
                        fillin' a date.
                    Th' feller that's willin' an' pleasant soon builds up an awful business.
                    We've allus noticed that th' fellers with th' most civic pride don't pay any
                        taxes.
                    Th' conversation never gits t' goin' good till th' hostess starts th'
                        Victroly.
                    Fellers that can't speak never let on when they're called on, but go right
                        ahead an' speak.
                    
                    We don't have t' have a receivin' set t' git in on the crime wave.
                    We don't believe anybuddy wuz ever too good t' be a clerkin', even if lots o'
                        them do act like it.
                    We kin remember when a woman wuz satisfied t' be known as th' wife o'
                        some-buddy.
                    What's become o' th' ole fashioned girl that used t' drop out o' sight when
                        crossed in love?
                    Wouldn't it be fine if we could run out o' debt?
                    
                    Skirts may git back t' ther ole length, but women 'll allus cross ther legs
                        on th' front porch.
                    Some folks are never as happy an' glowin' as when they're tryin' t' make us
                        sorry that we've missed somethin'.
                    No matter how wretched times git, ther's allus plenty o' want ads fer "good
                        salesmen."
                    "Anybuddy that's ever had a house painted would never select a complexion
                        from a color card," says Mrs. Em Moon.
                    A lovely party wuz given at th' home o' Mrs. Lafe Bud last evenin' fer Mrs.
                        Al Mopps, who's soon t' institute proceedin's fer divorce.
                    
                    Ther's too blamed many new ways t' spend money an' not 'nough new ways t' git
                        it.
                    Miss Tawney Apple got her ears out t'day an' she didn' look so bad in
                        'em.
                    Who remembers when evangelists instead o' doctors used t' save our
                        drunkards?
                    Next t' a neat an' fatherly lookin' confidence man, nothin' operates under as
                        many aliases as a Ben Davis apple.
                    Somebuddy asked Al Mopps why he didn' tackle any kind o' work he could git,
                        an' he said, "I tried that four or five years ago an' somethin' better never
                        did show up."

                    "A man allus acts like a sheep killin' dog; when he asks fer credit, but a
                        woman 'll be wearin' silk stockin's an' smile her purtiest when she charges
                        a sack o' corn meal," says Elmer Moots, o' th' Cash Grocery.
                    
                    Th' only time mean people smile is when they're hurt.
                    We hain't seen Jake Bentley as pleasant an' optimistic in years as he is
                        t'day. He says his farm 'll yield enough t' pay his taxes.
                    O' course any administration is liable t' have long drawn out strikes an'
                        crop failures, but a "protective" tariff is th' Republican party's own
                        idee.
                    Our new library is nearin' completion an' it's almost purty enough fer a
                        fillin' station.
                    Nothin's as aggrevatin' as th' clerk that chats pleasantly while he's
                        overchargin' us.
                    
                    The hardest thing is writin' a recommendation fer some one we know.
                    We counted fourteen women swingin' by ther teeth at th' last circus. Th'
                        stunt seems so easy it's strange society don't take it up.
                    Next t' bein' president o' Mexico, our idee o' short lived glory is bein'
                        Queen o' May.
                    We'd hoped Taft would take on a more serious expression when he got on th'
                        Supreme Bench, but he still looks like he'd jest found a dime in an ole
                        vest.
                    Ther ought t' be a law agin great statesmen usin' th' same photergraph fer
                        thirty years that they had taken th' day they wuz admitted t' th' bar.
                    
                    It seems like th' hardest thing is bein' good without paradin' it.
                    Women allus speak o' some young married couple as "apparently" gittin'
                        along.
                    Gushy people kin be as nice t' talk to as anybuddywhen they're
                        tired out.
                    Lots o' things baffle description, but they don't baffle folks that try t'
                        tell about 'em.
                    "I didn' git hardly any sleep at all last night on account o' burglars
                        cursin' o'er a swollen dresser drawer," complained Mrs. Tilford Moots, this
                        mornin'.
                
                
                
                    CRIMINALS AN' HOME TRAININ'.
                    By Constable Plum.
                    I want t' bitterly ridicule th' conclusion recently arrived at by th'
                        International Conference of Police Chiefs that lack o' home trainin' is
                        responsible fer our criminals. In so fer as regards that's concerned, ther
                        hain't nothin' into it. Lack o' home trainin,' lack o' watchfulness on th'
                        part o' parents, may result in pranks an' little misdemeanors on th' part o'
                        youngsters, but th' worst defaulters an' sharpers an' sneaks I've ever
                        knowed had good folks. Some o' them wuz educated fer th' ministry, an' all
                        o' them had been home trained right down t' th' minute. Ole Allison Peabody,
                            
                            CONSTABLE PLUM IN ACTION
                        
                         back in th' seventies, wuz sixty-five years ole
                        an' highly trained before he had an opportunity t' steal. He had allus been
                        in th' newspaper business before he wuz elected county treasurer. Al
                        Timmons's big auto wuz stolen by his own brother who'd never been away from
                        home but once in his life. Tipton Bud has got a nephew that wuz raised in an
                        apartment an' never had no home life an' he's almost twenty-two years ole
                        an' has never been in trouble. O' course it's fine fer folks t' set a good
                        example fer ther children an' urge 'em t' be honest so that when they git
                        put in jail they feel like they'd done ther best t' train 'em. Pearl Slocum,
                        that wuz electrocuted in th' east a few days ago fer murderin' an aged
                        couple fer seventy cents, wore spectacles when he wuz a little boy an'
                        recited in public. He had a goat an' a velocipede an' wuz a well trained
                        normal boy an' didn' leave home t' go t' work till he wuz thirty-two. It's
                        not generally known, but Jake Bentley has a boy in th' penitentiary.
                    
                    He's been ther fer years as a confirmed criminal. He wuz well raised,
                        educated an' polished, but he couldn' go near a pen an' ink without forgin'.
                        Fer a long time his folks hid th' ink bottle, but when fountain pens become
                        cheap an' plentiful ther wuz no controllin' him, so he had t' be put in th'
                        jug. Fer ever' brutal, clumsy crime committed by some dull ignorant feller
                        of obscure origin, ther's ten well planned atrocious crimes committed by
                        smart, educated an' responsible fiends with AI early trainin'. Jest recount
                        th' crimes o' th' last few months that wuz committed by well connected, well
                        raised an' even well-t'-do criminals. So well connected an' well-t'-do, in

                    TH' PROF. ELMER PEG DESERTION CASE.
                    By Mrs. Tilford Moots.
                    Ther's a great moral lurkin' in th' Prof. Elmer Peg desertion case, that
                        comes up at th' fall term o' court, a great lesson fer all, male an' female,
                        that contemplate gittin' married. Elmer Peg made th' common, age-old mistake
                        o' gittin' married before he found himself, before he knowed what his life
                        work wuz t' be. He wuz workin' in a saw-mill when he married M y r t i e
                        Tate, a girl ever'-way qualified t' grace a mill hand's home, an' had he
                        continued as a mill hand he wouldn' be where he is t'day which is in th' jug
                        with a 
                            ELMER PEG AN' WIFE IN TH' EARLY SAW MILL DAYS
                        
                         prison term confrontin' him, as he has no money.
                        His wife erred too. She should have cast about till she found a beau less
                        ambitious an' likely t' rise in th' world. Perhaps, like all girls high or
                        low, she did not stop t' think what she wuz doin'. She prob'ly reasoned,
                        "here's a chance t' git married" an' grabbed it. But Elmer Peg an' his wife
                        lived happily enough until in an evil moment he left th' saw mill t' become
                        a school teacher. His new callin' cast him 'mongst women folks, an' it wuz
                        only a few days till he developed a likin' fer a willowy organ teacher o'
                        gentle blood. As he learned t' know her better it begun t' dawn on him that
                        he'd married beneath him. He commenced t' regret that he wuz not single
                        agin. Th' tussle with his conscience grew fiercer an' fiercer day by day.
                        Finally he an' th' organ teacher decided they couldn' live without each
                        other. All th' while th' fat, simple, hard-workin' wife an' mother kept
                        singin' as she picked her way 'mongst her cooin',  sprawlin', crawlin' children, an' looked after th' routine duties o' th'
                        home. Several times she thought she detected a growin' coolness in th'
                        attitude of her school teacher husband, but she dismissed th' ugly thought,
                        an' attributed his demeanor t' th' complex an' arduous duties o' his
                        profession, an' that wuz purty good reasonin' fer an uncultured wild flower
                        utterly unacquainted with th' ways o' th' world. With nine little children
                        she wuz too busy t' watch her husband, an' as is too often th' case, she wuz
                        too dependent on him t' git him mad, much as it would have pleased him, fer
                        then he would have had some sort of an alibi fer his sneakin' conduct,
                        prob'ly incompatability. Anyhow, Prof. Elmer Peg an' his sweetheart organ
                        teacher run off t'gether. Public sympathy rushed out at once t' th' deserted
                        wife an' children, an' an aroused community demanded that no stone be left
                        unturned t' apprehend th' desertin' fiend. O' course he wuz found in due
                        time, as you  can't escape justice an' carry a
                        woman. In a statement t' Constable Newt Plum, who went t' Hurley, Wisconsin,
                        t' bring him back, th' professor said that he'd long considered makin' a
                        change, that his wife dressed too loose, that she made no effort t' reduce,
                        an' that she wuz no help t' him in his work. But as th' train pulled in an'
                        he seen his wife standin' in th' crowd, he cried: "I never seen Myrtie look
                        as purty. Somebody has dolled her up. Constable, all I ask is another
                        chance!" But he wuz too late, an' soon th' great iron door closed behind him
                        an' he wuz in a felon's cell.

                    JUNE
                    
                    "Well, we know where she is now," said Mrs. Em Moots, t'day, when her
                        daughter wuz buried.
                    
                    Too many people only pay as they go till they git so fer.
                    We don't know who fixes th' price on wheat an' hogs, but we would like t'
                        meet th' feller personally who fixed th' rate th' farmer charges fer pullin'
                        a car out o' a ditch.
                    Very few men have even noticed that th' girls are bobbin' ther hair.
                    It may be tough sleddin' fer workin' men, but we've never seen workin' girls
                        as prosperous lookin' as they are these days.
                    Th' disappearance o' Miss Mamie Lark is still a deep mystery. She's not been
                        seen since last Thursday evenin' when, after eatin' a hearty meal, she
                        chatted pleasantly with members of her household about wishin' she had a fur
                        coat.
                    
                    A bad cold, or business reasons, never held anybuddy back that had a
                        pass.
                    Th' lightnin' rod agent must sigh fer th' good ole "jays."
                    Speakin' of optimists, th' feller that jest methodically sets out t' git
                        married hain't so bad.
                    Ther's a front seat hog in ever' family.
                    No matter how young you feel, you're gittin' ole when you tell somebuddy th'
                        same story three times. (3)
                    
                    A rich gran'mother never gits in th' way.
                    We kin remember when women got ther hair bobbed on account o' typhoid fever
                        they kept out o' sight like a clipped collie.
                    A flapper fell down stairs comin' out o' th' Beauty Shop t'day, but as good
                        luck would have it she lit sticky side up.
                    Th' stingiest feller we've heard of yit is Lon Moon. He had a toy balloon
                        vulcanized.
                    Ever'thing fer th' home under th' sun is exhibited at th' Home Complete show
                        but Bibles an' marble-top tables.
                    
                    We're all strangers when it comes t' findin' Easy Street.
                    "Women in politics is th' limit," says 'Squire Marsh Swallow, "Nobuddy knowed
                        Lester Moon wuz a Democrat till he failed t' git a invitation t' th' Bentley
                        weddin'."
                    If beauty is skin deep some flappers are poor judges o' thickness.
                    Some folks seem t' take more delight in thinkin' they're indispensible than
                        they could possibly git out of a vacation.
                    What's become o' th' ole time groom who looked ever' inch a provider?
                    
                    Th' only way t' hold your own is jest t' refuse ever'buddy.
                    Finley Newcomb wuz found dead in his house, t'day, by neighbors who'd become
                        alarmed at not smellin' any mash cookin'.
                    Some o' these young wealthy dudes ought t' drive dog catcher's trucks so ther
                        girls couldn' jump out.
                    Ther's books on th' care o' lawns, hogs, bulbs, Airdales, poultry an' fruit
                        trees, but nobuddy has ever written anything on takin' care o' friends.
                    Mrs. Em Moots' niece is suin' her husband fer divorce. They first met about
                        two months ago while servin' on th' same jury.
                    
                    Bank cashiers seem t' be doin' too much backin' an' not enough side
                        steppin'.
                    We don't have t' stand on th' corner very long t' realize what a hard time
                        th' Follies must have in scarin' up enough shapely girls t' give a show.
                    Hard luck jest seems t' pursue Al Bentley. His fifteen-year-old daughter
                        hain't workin', his cow died in January, neuritis developed in his right arm
                        t'day an' he owns his own home.
                    Our idee o' somethin' t' worry about, next t' th' orign o' man, is who's
                        goin' t' make th' beds in th' Oser livery stable th' day Max lays off t' git
                        married.
                    Mr. Lemmie Peters, who graduated with such signal honors some years ago, has
                        several things in view, but nothin' in sight.
                    
                    We've allus noticed that a feller that kin turn his hand t' anything is
                        loafin'.
                    "Winkin' at th' law 'll produce crows' feet around th' left eye," writes Miss
                        Fawn Lippincut t' a beauty magazine.
                    'Squire Marsh Swallow has granted Bootlegger Ike Lark a 30-day reprieve so he
                        kin fill some banquet orders he's contracted fer.
                    Th' best thing about a spech by radio is that we don't have t' be a doctor t'
                        walk out on it.
                    Ther's allus an evil minded person in ever crowd t' put a livery stable
                        construction on nearly ever'thing that's said.
                    
                    Some women are so given t' boastin' that they brag on how much money ther
                        husbands save under prohibition.
                    "Another thing about prohibition," says Mrs. Em Moon, "I hain't had t' put a
                        paper under my husband's plate since th' saloons went out."
                    Lafe Bud has reserved a table an' a doctor fer New Year's eve at th' Palace

                    Mrs. Em Pash's brother suicided t'day by drinkin' holiday liquor.
                    We never know any more whether th' feller that walks in our office carryin' a
                        leather case is goin' t' try t' sell us a set of O. Henry or a set of Ole
                        Nelson.
                    
                    What th' country really needs is common sense an' Christianity, an' neither
                        p'litical party is long on either.
                    Federal prohibition officers swooped down on th' blacksmith shop t'day, but
                        it wuz only a horse gittin' shod.
                    Tell Binkley is passin' a petition around t' git Bootlegger Ike Lark out if

                    JULY
                    
                    We have favorite actors, favorite grocers, an' favorite doctors, but we don't
                        believe anybuddy ever had a favorite coal dealer.
                    
                    People who tell ever'thing they know wouldn' be so bad if they'd stop
                        there.
                    It's too bad th' feller that drinks varnish can't see his finish.
                    We allus wonder if a policeman chases a bandit as fast as he kin.
                    Some folks are so mean an' grouchy most o' th' time that when they are a
                        trifle pleasant we almost want t' give 'em a little kiss.
                    "I'd like t' go t' Floridy," said Ike Lark, t'day. "I hain't been out o'
                        town, 'cept when th' grand jury meets, fer years."
                    
                    Th' reason th' way o' th' transgressor is hard is 'cause it's so crowded.
                    Lots o' times parents are praised fer raisin' such a fine son when th' credit
                        really belongs t' some Scout master.
                    It used t' be "that man Wilson," but nowadays it's "th' Washin'ton
                        crowd."
                    Bootlegger Ike Lark announces that he'll not be available durin' th' hour of
                        his mother's funeral.
                    Ther's so many wonderful opportunities t' become a reformer these days that
                        we kin hardly resist th' temptation t' make a stab at it.
                    
                    Ther's too many folks talkin' that ought t' be listenin'.
                    "I thought I passed your feet t'day," said Lafe Bud, when he went home an'
                        found his sister-in-law had come fer a visit.
                    Ther's too much bein' said about th' inalienable right t' work where we
                        please fer what we please by those who hain't tried it.
                    When it comes t' enforcin' th' Volstead law prohibition agents seem t' be
                        about as effective as th' average chaperone.
                    It's been many a moon since anybuddy's had nerve enough t' name a daughter

                    TH' GUITAR.
                    By 'Squire Marsh Swallow.
                    Th' passin' away of Selam Lindsey, at th' poor farm last week, brings t' mind
                        th' ole happy, care-free guitar days. Th' guitar is or wuz a stringed
                        instrument with a body somewhat shaped like a insole. It's neck is like a
                        violin neck only different. Th' Spanish guitar Niles Turner brought home
                        from th' Mexican war fer his 
                            AL BEASLEY IN TH' PRIME O' YOUNG MANHOOD
                        
                         daughter had six stringsthree o' gut
                        an' three o' some other sortwire, we believe. They wuz tuned t' E
                        in th' second space o' th' bass staff, A in its fourth an' th' treble D, G,
                        B an' EI think, although I'm not positive. The intermediate
                        intervals wuz produced by th' pressure o' th' fingers o' th' left hand in
                        contact with frets fixed crosswise on th' keyboard runnin' up an' down th'
                        neck. Th' fingers o' th' right hand did th' pluckin', or twitchin'. Th'
                        Spaniards are supposed t' have discovered th' guitar, although it thrived in
                        Thibet at a very early date, an one wuz unearthed in fair condition on
                        Easter Island. Salem Lindsey wuz a prolific guitar player. His father had
                        left him a fine estate, but he soon neglected th' farm an' took up with th'
                        guitar. Acre after acre o' valuable land went t' pay his G string bills.
                        After sellin' his stock an' farmin' implements he opened a guitar school
                        over th' saddlery shop that used t' be located where th' town pump now
                        stands. He taught many maidens  t' play th'
                        guitar, as it wuz considered as one o' th' desirable accomplishments o' that
                        early period. Th' music o' th' guitar wuz peculiarly sweet an' plaintive. It
                        had no bad after effects like th' music o' t'day. Ther wuz not a pang o'
                        regret in a whole even' of it. True, it wuz soft an' allurin' an' sweetly
                        romantic, an' had caused some mismatin', but it has a greater number o'
                        endurin' marriages t' its credit than most any instrument that we kin now
                        recall. But th' guitar has had its day like various danderines. It's use
                        dwindled till only a few firemen an' barbers cared t' bother with it.
                        Occasionally it wuz found still in use in some livery stables as late as
                        1890. Fireman Al Beasley used t' be a poplar guitar player. He had a mouth
                        organ, or French harp, attached t' his guitar in such a way that he could
                        conquer both instruments at once. Th' effect wuz very beautiful, an' it
                        looked fer awhile like th' guitar still had many years o' usefulness ahead
                        on account o' this new contrivance.  But instead
                        it failed rapidly from then on like lots o' people that take on new ideas.
                        Th' busy era o' money makin' an' industry wuz too much fer th' ole languid
                        guitar an' one is rarely seen or heard any more unless it is with some
                        travelin' band o' imitation Hawaiians.
                    Bootleggers walk in where book agents fear t' tread.
                    Next t' handshakin', nothin' has been as overworked an' successful as
                        promisin' t' reduce taxes.
                    Hain't it wonderful how th' average family all gits t'gether agin before
                        breakfastor nearly allus?
                
                
                
                    ORGUST
                    
                    Wouldn' it be great if ever'buddy wuz as polite an' affable as th' feller
                        that says, "I don't want t' take up any o' your time?"
                    
                    Th' real judge o' whisky wouldn' think o' drinkin' it.
                    Plates wuz laid fer forty at th' 5oth weddin' anniversary o' Mr. an' Mrs.

                    Who remembers when nobuddy but an Osage Indian would drink anything?

                    Wesley Peters, who shot his hired hand, 'll be given a second trial as he had
                        two farms.

                    Art Smiley, aged fifty-five, has disappeared an' grave fears are entertained
                        that he wuz led astray while passin' th' high school.
                    A radio receivin' set is a dandy thing t' keep folks at home who don't
                        drink.
                    Miss Irma Moots got almost halfway home last night before she wuz knocked
                        down an' robbed.
                    Tipton Bud will be seventy-two years ole next coal strike.
                    
                    It must make a fool feel like thirty cents when he sees where a 17-year-ole
                        girl dares t' tread.

                        garage first.
                    Th' feller that's given t' worryin' is t' be congratulated on th' present
                        unusually fine selection o' things t' worry about.
                    Th' hardest thing, next t' bein' a Christian in Armenia, is scrapin' up a
                        little sympathy fer th' feller whose car's been stolen fer th' third
                        time.
                    Miss Princess Bud has got a good joke on her dad. He didn' recognize her
                        yisterday until after he'd paid her way t' a movie.
                    
                    Ther are people dyin' t'day who were never drunk before.
                    While out shoppin' don't cuss th' poor wrappin' girl fer bein' slow. She's
                        waitin' fer a go ahead signal from th' bookkeeper.
                    You couldn' hire some fellers t' carry a watermelon, but they jest love t'
                        lug a bowlin' ball thro' town.
                    Mrs. Em Moots' brother wuz so used t' seein' fast trains in th' movies that
                        he held his ground yisterday an' wuz knocked t' smithereens.
                    Lafe Bud's cousin wuz poisoned by a bell boy at Dayton yisterday.
                    
                    It takes an exceptional child t' pass th' bill boards these days without
                        becomin' a cigarette smoker.
                    Lafe Bud found a quarter this mornin' jest as some young lady wuz goin' t'
                        step on it.
                    We kin recollect when a color-blind cashier or a feller that fooled a girl
                        wuz lost t' society ferever.
                    Elmer Moots says ther's lots o' things in the stores he'd like t' have if
                        they'd be willin' t do housework.
                    Th' trouble with killin' somebuddy or stealin' somethin' is that we've got t'
                        worry thro' a long, tiresome trial before we finally reach th' pardon
                        board.
                    
                    If some folks would put down th' top they wouldn' have a roof o'er ther
                        heads.
                    Ther's a shade o' stockin's being worn these days, a sort of a tone between a
                        girl's neck an' a carriage painter's arm, that hain't helpin' our return t'
                        normalcy.
                    It's some country where you kin sleep in a box car t'night, write a southern
                        jazz song t'morrow, an' own a luxurious auto th' day follerin'.
                    Mrs. Em Moots has a cousin that's lived in Muncie almost a year an' has never
                        seen th' inside of a courtroom.
                    Clocked socks an' watched stockin's are unusually plentiful.
                    
                    Mebbe th' reason we don't see more good lookin' women is because women are
                        jest wakin' up.
                    Mrs. Joe Kite is nursin' in th' home O' Mrs. Tilford Moots, whose husband is
                        legitimately paralyzed.
                    What gits us is how so many folks that pass in th' day's news manage t'
                        pass.

                    "Bootleggers on th' run," says a newspaper, but that's cause they're back on
                        ther orders.
                    An elephant act caved in on th' barber shop under Melodeon Hall last
                        night.
                    Cheer up!!! What if ever'thing cost as much as a lamp shade?
                    Speakin' o' business, th' manager o' th' Monarch 5 & 10 says they've
                        sold more checker boards durin' th' past year than in th' whole precedin'

                    CHILDREN
                    By Dr. Mopps.
                    Children are great institutions. They don't only half way hold a home
                        t'gether fer a few years, but they give parents somethin' t' think about
                        besides cards.
                    Babies bring estranged relatives t'-gether, they thaw out rich grandparents,
                        an' reconcile mismated couples. Children give th' neglected wife some-thin'
                        t' live fer, an' often bring th' errin' husband t' his senses. Th' advent o'
                        th' first baby revolutionizes a home, 'specially a cramped apartment. Th'
                        young husband then realizes fer th' first time that he's really
                        handcuffedthat he's th' responsible head o' a real establishment,
                        instead 
                            SOFTENIN' AN OBDURATE HUSBAND
                        
                         o' a dollin' up station, an' th' girl wife
                        begins t' think of all th' things they'll do after th' little darlin' gits
                        big enough t' leave alone. Th' first baby makes a real-fer-sure partnership
                        o' marriage. Th' low, overhangin' dread of a splitup disappears, th' mere,
                        loose bow knot o' matrimony becomes a link o' steel, while th' four dollar
                        plated weddin' ring is reinforced by a mutual interest that's stronger than
                        all th' vows an' jewelry in christendom. Th' real business o' marriage has
                        begun when th' first baby comes. Th' long years o' feedin', an' trainin',
                        an' washin', an' dressin,' an' educatin' th' child, have started. Maybe th'
                        home'll be blessed by other children as time goes on. In that event th' work
                        o' raisin' 'em an' puttin' 'em on a payin' basis may cover many years. But
                        th' time finally comes when th' children are all scattered an' gone, an'
                        then th' parents, if they're still livin' t'gether, are free t' see th'
                        Grand Canyon, or buy a roadster, or visit th' 
                        children, or do any ole thing that strikes ther fancy. Maybe they kin split
                        up if things are too prosy. Ther's allus th' possibility of a married
                        daughter comin' home t' roost, but she kin hunt up an aunt if her parents
                        happen t' be estranged, or off on a little trip. Married sons are not allus
                        doin' as well as ther mothers say they are, but they usually keep away
                        pretty well. But parents have very generally done ther part an' are entitled
                        t' a vacation by th' time th' last child tears out. Nothin' gladdens th'
                        hearts o' parents like good well-t'-do sons, an' happily married daughters.
                        Ther's a feelin' o' pride, if not security, that comes over th' parents of a
                        kind, rich son, that can't be exaggerated, an' a feelin' o' relief in
                        knowin' a daughter is married an' out o' harm's way that baffles adequate
                        description. What could be finer than a big, noble well-t'-do son fer a
                        father t' lean on? Or what is sweeter than a smilin', respectful daughter t'
                        lighten a mother's load, an' help her pick  out a
                        pair o' pumps? How a father likes t' say, "Henry talks some o' visitin' us
                        this year if his firm kin spare him," an' how a mother likes t' say,
                        "Ellie's doin' jest th' best kind." We suppose th' ole time honored custom
                        o' raisin' families'll go on ferever with th' same varyin' success that has
                        allus attended th' industry. Finley New-comb an' wife celebrated ther
                        sixtieth weddin' anniversary at th' county poor farm, last Tuesday, an'
                        received a stout varnished cane an' a fancy wooden fan from ther son at
                        Leavenworth prison.
                    Another menace t' life an' limb is th' feller that tries t' drive an'
                        flirt.
                    A son kin never repay his mother, but she never seems t' hold it against
                        him.

                    If ther's anything worse'n a ready talker it's a prolific letter writer.
                    
                    Nobuddy ever bought a friend that didn' git stung.
                    Next t' wearin' suspenders with a belt, th' worst thing is wearin' spats
                        without carryin' a cane.
                    Constable Newt Plum wuz held up last night, but th' bandits didn' git
                        nothin'. "Somethin' told me I'd git robbed," says Newt, "so I jest left my
                        spectacles an' revolver at home."
                    After plasterin' th' town with prosperity posters yisterday, Billposter
                        Finley Meadows grew despondent over th' business outlook an' hanged himself
                        in th' O. K. livery barn.
                    Pony Mopps started t' git pickled Saturday, but he wuz too stingy t' go thro'
                        with it.
                    
                    Next t' drinkin' t' be affable, th' worst thing is paintin' your face so you
                        kin wear gray.
                    It's mighty fine t' be educated an' informed if you kin hide it successfully
                        enough not t' make ever'buddy around you uncomfortable.
                    We've allus wondered if Henry Ford, with all his wealth an' genius, could put
                        a run-down hotel back on a payin' basis?
                    People are all alike, we're all human an' have our honest convictions an'
                        beliefs, 'cept a few Republicans that used t' be Democrats.
                    We didn't know Jake Bentley's brother wuz rich till we read that his trial
                        wouldn' come up till next July.
                    
                    Some folks git married before they go t' Niagary Falls an' others suicide
                        after they git there.
                    We kin tell purty much by a feller's fenders how he'd eat a roastin' ear.
                    Th' workmen at th' saw mill threaten t' walk out an' git in ther cars if th'
                        boss don't quit tryin' t' run things.
                    Next t' a Ford we don't know o' nothin' that makes as much noise fer its size
                        as a katydid.
                    Ther's few things as painful as kickin' a burglar with your bare foot.
                    
                    One good turn deserves another, but one good story ought t' stand.
                    What gits us is why th' movie industry wants t' hire anybuddy by th' year
                        that kin clean up anything as big an' complicated as th' pustoffice
                        department in a couple o' months.
                    A few satisfied customers kin do more'n a full page ad, but a lot o' store
                        keepers don't seem t' know it.
                    Folks that can't stand prosperity are still comparatively safe.
                    Thanks t' th' radio, th' home is begin in' t' show some signs o' life.
                    
                    Remember how we used t' dread t' go t' a party before they made it at
                        home.
                    Th' burlesque show at Melodeon Hall, last night, seemed t' be on its last
                        legs.
                    Mrs. Tilford Moots has received a pustal card from her niece, who's visitin'
                        in Californy, sayin' she's decided t' stay until murder after next.
                    Speakin' o' big crowds, we recall when Bryan spoke here, jest before his last
                        defeat, a woman passed her baby o'er th' heads o' th' crowd fer th' Commoner
                        t' kiss, an' when she got her kid back he wuz married an' settled in
                        Kokomo.
                    "If I can't git in th' movies I kin git on a jury," says Lon Moon, who's

                        in th' ole days.
                    Th' boarders at th' Elite Drug store have presented Pharmacist Artie Small
                        with a handsome carvin' set.
                    Lafe Bud's uncle, who has been dabblin' around with first one thing then
                        another fer years, will address our business men on "Application, th'
                        Steppin' Stone t' Success."
                    "Well, I'm glad Bill has finally got with a goin' concern," said Uncle Niles
                        Turner, when Bill Hays resigned from th' Hardin' administration an' signed
                        up with th' screeners.
                    
                    You can't stop a thing by makin' a crime of it.
                    No matter what business we're in, we all have times when we'd love t' be a
                        policeman.
                    Married men live jest as long as single menif they're slick.
                    How are we goin' t' tell when a flapper becomes a woman?
                    Mrs. Tipton Bud missed "Th' Four Horsemen" at th' Fairy Grotto, last night,
                        as she had t' hold a burglar till th' constable come.
                    
                    It's cheaper t' pay rent than marry a home.
                    Even if labor an' capital do git t'gether, we're confronted with a fer worse
                        combinationlong skirts an' bobbed hair.
                    Another drawback t' a wife in th' back seat is that she can't see from where
                        she sets that we didn' come within a mile o' hittin' somethin'.
                    Who remembers when gasoline didn't have a first name?

                        what they'll stand fer. Th' feller that talks about what "th' people" want
                        may think he knows what his own neighbors, or community, or state wants, but
                        we don't believe anybuddy knows what th' country, or th' people as a whole,
                        wants, an' what's worse, we don't believe "th' people" know 'emselves. Th'
                        other day we heard a feller remark, "How long will th' people stand it?" We
                        don't know whether he wuz talkin' about th' 8-cent cigar or bobbed hair, but
                        whatever it wuz 'll prob'ly run its course like "After th' Ball," our
                        aroused patriotism, an' plucked eyebrows, an' then be cast aside fer
                        somethin' more excitin'. Sometimes a considerable number o' people git
                        impatient an' club t'gether an'  lynch somebuddy,
                        an' occasionally they all git ther heads t'gether an' elect a reformer, but
                        it hain't long till they're all split up agin. A feller 'll declare, "th'
                        people" demand light beer an' wine, an' th' next day eight or nine hundred
                        dry candidates 'll be elected all over th' country, from senators up t'
                        coroners. Sometimes a formidable bulk o' th' voters 'll become aroused an'
                        demand a change, but it hain't no time till they're tired of it, an'
                        demandin' another one. It's got so a statesman never knows where he
                        standsidolized t'day an' hissed on th' screen t'morrow afternoon.
                        Roosevelt wuz idolized, kicked out, an reidolized. "People are funny
                        things," remarked Manager Gabe Craw, o' Melodeon Hall t'day. "They'll clamor
                        fer musical shows fer a while, an' then kick up an' demand a mellerdrama,
                        an' then ther'll be a long lull when they don't seem t' want nothin', an'
                        then I'll give 'em a burlesque 
                        
                            A CANDIDATE GUESSIN' IT TH' FIRST TIME
                        
                         show, an' they'll do purty well fer a spell, an'
                        then ask fer 'East Lynne.' They jest don't seem t' know what they want."
                        People 'll rush t' a new restaurant fer awhile, an' jest as soon as th'
                        proprietor thinks he's all set, an' starts t' buy an automobile, they desert
                        him. Ever'thing, restaurants, statesmen, songs, derby hats, bobbed hair, an'
                        all kinds o' styles an' fads, seem t' have jest so long t' live, an' then
                        "th' people" drop 'em fer somethin' different. We're amazed that "th'
                        people" have stood th' saxophone so long. But we'll say this fer "th'
                        people," they're allus willin' t' give most anything a trial, an' some
                        things a second trial, an' that's what keeps th' country balled up an'
                        unsettled most o' th' time. Of course we believe th' styles ought t' change
                        occasionally, an' a new song helps out once in awhile, an' it's a healthy
                        sign when some fellers git kicked out o' office, but ther's a whole lot o'
                        fundamentals in this life that "th' people" 
                        ought t' quit monkeyin' with, things they ought t' accept an' git reconciled
                        to. We hain't got much but a cow, but we'll stake her that death, taxes, an'
                        th' shirt waist are here t' stay.
                    
                    Th' success o' Master Jackie Coogan is proof that a clean life won't hold you
                        back if you've got th' goods.
                    Th' feller that marries a girl that rolls her own is purty sure t' darn his
                        own.
                    Mrs. Lafe Bud's maid skipped out last night takin' a pair o' black
                        embroidered silk stockin's an' a recipe fer beer.
                    Jake Bentley's daughter, who wuz married yisterday, is th' first stubby stout
                        t' pick up a husband here in three of four years.
                    Lafe Bud had a chance t' buy a case o' Scotch whisky an' some Holland gin
                        this mornin', so th' world hain't so big after all.

                    Next t' waitin' fer a laundry t' adjust a claim, th' worst thing is standin'
                        around while a clerk hunts somethin' you saw in th' show window.
                    
                    Be sure you know what it's goin' t' cost, then go ahead, is th' wise course
                        these days.
                    Of all th' good ole sayin's, th' one that's gone ahead an' kept up with th'
                        times is, "Ther's no fool like an' ole fool."
                    We don't believe it gits a congressman anything t' send a package o'
                        watermelon seeds t' a feller that lives in apartments.
                    It's easy t' tell whether a son looks like his father or mother, but th'
                        modern daughter don't look like anybuddy we ever saw unless it's Pauline
                        Hall or Della Fox.
                    We've never wanted t' hold but one office, one givin' us th' authority t'
                        make public utilities that tear up th' streets, put 'em back immediately
                        jest exactly like they wuz.
                    
                    Few things look as shiftless as a big, strong, full grown man sellin'

                    In India th' girls marry at th' age o' ten, but in this country they don't
                        begin t' paint up an' scout around till they're thirteen.
                    Mrs. Tilford Moots has quit votin' an' gone back t' housekeepin'.
                    Fiends in human form stole a cook stove from th' Lafe Bud home last evenin'
                        while Mrs. Bud wuz tunin' in on Balboa, C. G.
                    "Jest foller th' broken jugs," said Constable Plum, t'day, when a stranger
                        asked th' way t' Louisville. (5)
                    
                    Some folks are so anxious t' git ther money's worth that they'll buy a ticket
                        t' a home talent performance an' then go.
                    Tell Binkley overslep this mornin' as no burglars showed up.
                    Oscar Sapp, who wuz buried under his car, t'day, died from th' loss o' blood
                        while th' officers searched fer liquor.
                    Th' hardest thing is t' keep behind a good lookin' girl without seemin' t' be
                        tryin'.
                    Jake Bentley an' family are goin' t' make an extensive tour o' th'
                        worldwhen th' tariff does all th' things fer th' farmer it's
                        supposed t' do.
                    Thanks t' th' radio, a feller no longer has t' own a tuxedo t' hear good
                        singin'.
                    
                    Women are purty keen about ever'thing but pickin' out a provider an' fixin'
                        an allowance fer a son.
                    "I'm jest like a pair o' white stockin's," complained Tell Binkley, t'day, "I
                        start out fine, but I soon wilt an' look frazzled."
                    If th' girls 'll jest display ther real dispositions while they're at it, all
                        will be fergiven.
                    We hardly ever encounter th' once pop'lar jett black raven mustache anymore
                        unless we meet a veteran policeman.
                    We hope suspenders do come back, fer if ther's anything worse'n a woman
                        powderin' her nose at ever show window she comes to, it's a feller yankin'
                        his trousers up ever half block.
                    There's such a thing as bein' so home lovin' that you don't amount t'
                        any.
                    
                    "I'll be glad when th' crime wave's over. If I set in th' front room th'
                        burglars go in the back way, an' if I set in a back room they go in th'
                        front way," says Mrs. Tilford Moots.
                    Who remembers th' ole, dusty, open bin grocery where we used t' eat 15 cents
                        worth o' dried peaches while we wuz buyin' a Io-cent can o' sardines.
                    Manager Gabe Craw, o' Melodeon Hall, had decided t' take out weather
                        insurance if coal don't come down.
                    Maybe we're too observin', but have you ever noticed what disreputable
                        lookin' shoes shoe clerks wear?
                    Ever' time we read about tumultous applause an' vest throngs we're reminded
                        of all th' hats we lost on ex-Senitur Beveridge.
                    
                    If our army in France had been composed o' congressmen it would be runnin'
                        yit.
                    Th' nickel cigar has come sneakin' back, but we wouldn' want it named after
                        us.
                    Th' show at Melodeon Hall, last night, didn' let out till after midnight as
                        th' magician had t' borrow a plug hat.
                    In enumeratin' all th' extravagance o' th' war, th' stump speaker fergits t'
                        mention that we trained, fed an' clothed two million too many soldiers,
                        also.
                    Speakin' o' th' orign o' man, we're rather inclined t' believe that most
                        folks are fer more interested in what prices used t' be.
                    Some candidates openly boast that they'll enforce th' laws, an' others are
                        elected.
                    
                    Ther's nothin' as uncertain as a sure thing.
                    Contractor Al Blizzard wuz fined $500 an' thirty days in jail t'day fer
                        allowin' empty cement bags t' blow over th' streets. He got off easy.
                    A carpenter 'll sharpen his saw, an' he'll set his plane, an' he'll sight
                        down a two by four, an' if we wait around long enough we may catch him
                        workin'.
                    Some stranger rented a house here t'day without his wife first seein' it, an'
                        th' neighbors already have him listed as a domineerin' brute.
                    Farmer Jake Bentley takes this means t' announce that he plowed an' voted
                        both on election day.
                    
                    Next t' a stepladder, th' most dangerous thing t' have around th' house is a
                        loaded revolver.
                    Jake Bentley fell off a load o' hay t'day an' had t' crawl all th' way t' th'

                    Aunt Mandy Kite died t'day before her doctor could change his clothes an' git

                    TH' GENEROUS DISTRIBUTION O' TROUBLE.
                    By Rev. Wiley Tanger.
                    We don't believe ther's anything, not barrin' th' air we breathe, that's as
                        widely an' generously distributed as trouble. Ever'buddy we talk to has got
                        some, an' every' buddy we hear of has a plenty. Lots o' folks manage t' git
                        along on imaginary trouble till th' real thing comes along, an' imaginary
                        trouble is even worse than actual trouble. Some folks are born with trouble,
                        others marry trouble, an' some make ther own. Some, borrow trouble, others
                        have trouble handed t' 'em, while many less patient people hustle out an'
                        dig up 
                            SOME FOLKS BUY TROUBLE
                        
                         trouble. Some people are miserable if somethin'
                        hain't troublin' 'em t' complain about, while others pretend t' be fine an'
                        dandy. Trouble seems t' be a part o' th' scheme o' life an' nobuddy is
                        immune. We have smilin' optimists, but they have ther dull days, an' we have
                        thick skinned whistlers that grin thro' all sorts o' rebuffs an'
                        disappointments, but they finally have t' settle. Jake Bentley's case is a
                        notable one. He's whistled an' hummed thro' funerals, an' fires, an' floods
                        an' two or three wives. Last week we saw him leanin' agin th' Peoples' Bank,
                        an' as we drew near we noticed he wuzn' whistlin'. He couldn' start his car,
                        an' all his optimism deserted him in a body. But th' face is not allus th'
                        index t' a feller's peace o' mind. We never know what's back of a smilin'
                        personality or a row o' beautiful bill boards. Th' gracious hostess may
                        burst int' a flood o' tears before she has time t' turn th' down stairs
                        lights off after her friends depart. We often read,  "When last seen he wuz in th' best o' spirits." A husband may own
                        two cars an' love his family an' be thrown in jail t'morrow. A society queen
                        may live in luxury an' be th' life of her set an' weep bitter tears because
                        her ankles don't suit her. A youth may be th' envy of all his associates an'
                        t' all appearances fixed fer life, an' skulk away an' grieve because he
                        can't find a soft collar that'll stand up. Some fellers kid an' joke along
                        an' make money an' live fine an' have all kinds o' luck an' then fall in
                        love with some flapper that can't see him with a searchlight. Sometimes a
                        feller's wife'll stick t' him in adversity an' love an' encourage him an'
                        yet he'll complain. Ever' two or three months Chauncey Depew celebrates his
                        birthday an' issues a statement sayin' all is well, yet we'll bet he has his
                        troubles between banquets. No home is complete without trouble. We hear o'
                        happy homes, but they're only not quite as unhappy as some others. No home
                        gits by very long  without a calamity, but some
                        homes handle 'em beter. Some folks worry inwardly while others pe-rade ther
                        troubles. Some folks like t' think that they've been singled out fer all th'
                        trouble, but such is not th' case. If they'd read th' papers they'd see
                        where nearly ever'buddy's full up with trouble o' one kind or another. But
                        trouble certainly takes th' conceit out of us an' upsets that smugness that
                        too often makes us feel superior an' apart from th' common run o' humanity.
                        We kin stay single an' keep measurably happy, an' we kin move in apartments
                        an' evade taxes, but nobuddy ever yit side-stepped trouble.

                    Th' girl in a print dress needn' worry about not havin' any swell clothes as

                    We noticed one thingan "attractive widow" nearly allus has some
                        insurance money.
                    "Mostly farmers," said Manager Gabe Craw, t'day, when a the-atrical agent
                        asked him about th' acoustics o' Melodeon Hall.
                    Th' smile in business wuz introduced durin' th' palmy days o' th' war, an' it
                        begins t' look like th' retailer wuz goin' t' stick to it.
                    Little children don't run t' meet ther parents like they used to, an' we
                        wonder if anything has come between them.
                    Th' trouble with lookin' unusually well an' hearty is that somebuddy's allus
                        predictin' that we'll go all at once some day.
                    
                    We've often wondered why labor don't use th' same tactics as capital an' then
                        th' public wouldn' know what it wuz puttin' over till it wuz too late.
                    Some fellers ideer o' showin' ther wives a good time is takin' 'em on a
                        campin' trip.
                    Miss Fawn Lippincut got almost downtown t'day before she remembered she had a
                        hole in th' knee of her left stockin'.
                    Sheriff-elect Ike Soles used th' Bible in this fall's campaign instead of th'

                    A bride 'll promise t' love, honor an' obey, an' before th' icin' is cold on
                        th' weddin' cake she'll flatly refuse t' leave town in a day coach.
                    
                    Some people may stand fer onions, but we don't believe anybuddy ever really
                        excused 'em.
                    Joe Lark has come out broken arched fer light fines an' beer.
                    Th' public has got too many grievances of its own these days t' waste any
                        sympathy on either capital or labor.
                    Th' latest fad among th' male flappers is th' Valentino sideburns.
                    "Nothin' gits my goat as quick as th' meditative coo of a turtle dove," said

                    If we all kept our ears as close t' th' ground as we keep our eyes we might
                        learn a few things.
                    Th' nearest we've come t' hearin' any of our women voters discuss th' great
                        political questions o' th' day is an occasional reference t' "that ole
                        Wilson," or "that ole Hardin'."
                    Mr. and Mrs. Aaron Shott are raisin' a daughter an' they're scared t' death

                    Uncle Ez Pash has cut out sugar an' white bread so he kin vote th' Democratic
                        ticket ten years longer.
                    Another drawback t' havin' a family t' support is that we've got t' decline
                        so many honors.
                    
                    If th' modern three-fer-a-quarter cigar is any barometer we haint even
                        started back t' normalcy.
                    A spoken performance o' "East Lynne," by one o' th' best companies afoot, 'll
                        be given at Melodeon Hall in th' near future.
                    It begins t' look like short skirts, like high prices, are only goin' t' come
                        down in rare an' unimportant instances.
                    One reason we don't believe in signs is because so many red-nosed fellers
                        with droopin' mustache hang around "soft drink" saloons.
                    Next t' findin' a suitable site fer a carbuncle, th' hardest thing is

                    TH' SONGS O' YESTERDAY.
                    By Clem Harner, th' Veteran Minstrel.
                    Ther's a lot o' difference between th' pop'lar songs o' t'day an' th' pop'lar
                        songs o' my time. Th' pathetic ballad used t' be all th' rage. I've seen
                        whole the-aters full o' people weep at a song. It wuz a wonderful sight t'
                        look out at an audience from th' stage while a ballad wuz bein'
                        sungt' look out upon a sea o' tears sparklin' in th' soft, mellow
                        gas light o' th' auditorium. Folks preferred songs tinged with sadness. It
                        wuz along about this period that th' great emotional plays o' East Lynne an'
                        Camille captured th' country. One night at La Rue, Ohio, a feller 
                            A MOTTO VOCALIST OF TH' LATE 80's
                        
                         suicided by jumpin' out o' th' gallery while a
                        young minstrel tenor (an' snare drummer in th' band) wuz singin' "I Believe
                        It 'Cause My Mother Told Me So." "Where Is My Wanderin' Boy T'night?" "Just
                        Break th' News t' Mother," "Put My Little Shoes Away," "Only a Pansy
                        Blossom," an' "Teach Our Baby That I'm Dead," are a few o' th' ole timers
                        that used t' saturate th' the-ater floors. You could never tell when one o'
                        these songs wuz goin' t' stir up a tender recollection an' somebuddy would
                        have t' be carried out o' th' the-ater. "Jest Tell 'Em That You Saw Me" wuz
                        one o' th' last o' th' pathetic ballads t' sadden th' country. I've even
                        seen th' orchestry break down an' cry at this song, while th' singer himself
                        had t' use smellin' salts t' go thro' with th' last verse. Th' story o' th'
                        song wuz like this: A feller wuz in a big city on a $1 excursion an' on mere
                        pleasure bent. He wuz jest comin' out of a 20-cent resturint when he saw a
                        flashy lookin' girl he thought he  recognized.
                        "Is that you Madge?" he cried t' her, an' she quickly turned away. He chased
                        after her, an' catchin' her by th' feather boa, he continued, "Don't turn
                        away, Madge, I'm still your friend." Well, then, th' girl didn' know what t'
                        say or do. She wuz caught dead t' rights. She wuz dressed too good t' be
                        workin', an', besides, she had no trade or callin' whereby she could earn a
                        livin'. At best she couldn' have been makin' over six dollars a week in them
                        days. Th' fact wuz she wuzn' livin' right. Finally she wept, then th' feller
                        said, "I'm goin' back home on No. 18 an' I thought perhaps some message
                        you'd like t' send." She hesitated a little, an' then she half-way looked up
                        an' said, with her big eyes filled with tears, "Jest tell 'em that you saw
                        me, an' they'll know th' rest, jest tell 'em I wuz lookin' well, you know."
                        The feller promised he'd tell 'em, an' wuz jest about t' dodge in fer a
                        couple o' beers when th' girl cried t' him an' said, in tremblin' voice, (6)
                             "An' tell mother dear I love her jest th'
                        same as I did long years ago, an' some day I'm comin' home agin t' her."
                        These last lines wuz allus th' cue fer th' audience t' break completely
                        down, if not th' singer. Once while watchin' th' audience leave th' the-ater
                        after hearin' th' song I heard a feller say t' his girl, "Shall we stop at
                        th' resturint an' git some oysters, May?" An' she said, "No, Albert dear,
                        take me home quickly," an' both dried ther eyes an' climbed in a buggy.

                    We never hear o' any romances bein' traced t' a patent medicine picture.

                        "We've only burned five tons so fer."
                    We kin recall when it wuz quite a compliment t' say somebuddy made a bully
                        speech.
                    Another thing a feller never fails t' learn at college is how t 'run in

                    Druggist Artie Small cut his thumb t' day while fillin' a prescription fer a

                    "I'd know th' name if I heard it," seems t 'be th' most pop'lar of all th'

                    Ther's bound t' be trouble when our reputation outgrows our income.
                    "Let me tell you a funny coincidence," so many folks 'll say, an' then they
                        tell us somethin' that hain't a coincidence at all.
                    "They must have company, th' cellar's lit up," said Miss Fawn Lippincut, as
                        she passed the Bud home last night.
                    Stew Nugent writes his mother here that he wuz th' only one in a class o'
                        seven that successfully passed an auto theft investigation at Columbus, Ohio
                        last week.
                    Hank Wiley, once a wild an' pop'lar resident here, is livin' very simple in

                    Elmer Moots took a little walk around town t'day jest t' see 'f he could find

                    Four beauty doctors are tinkerin' with Mrs. Linnet Spry, but they hain't
                        given th' husband any hope.
                    Somebuddy's allus talkin' about educatin' "th' people" up t' somethin'. Th'
                        tariff has been discussed fer forty years an' "th' people" don't seem to be
                        onto it yit.
                    Here's a hunchHenry Ford got rich sellin' th' people what they
                        wanted without holdin' 'em up.

                        purtiest woman in th' suffrage movement.
                    Th' backbone of our civilization is made up o' fellers that eat in ther shirt
                        sleeves, say "hain't saw," chew scrap t'backer an' trim ther finger nails in
                        public, so don't nag 'em.
                    If bootleggers would drink with ther customers like th' ole time bartender
                        did, ther wouldn' be any.
                    Between folks tourin' in cars an' fellers walkin' from Frisco t' Boston it's
                        a wonder th' railroads hold up as well as they do.
                    Henry Ford is purty rich considerin' he never took advantage of his
                        opportunities.
                    
                    If there's anything worse'n a long-haired man it's a short haired woman.

                    Mrs. Tilford Moots' gran'father, who has played golf fer th' past three

                    Another thing that'll have t' be revised is th' ole slogan, "vote fer th'

                    Th' surest way t' double your money is t' make a "double" out o' your

                    Ther's many a lie spoken in an effort t' be agreeable.

                    Senator Newberry seems t' be a bigger fizzle than an off-year mayor.
                    
                    Th' leader o' any enterprise should never be a feller with nothin' t'

                    It don't seem t' us that ther's as many sober second thoughts as ther used t'
                        be.
                    We've often wondered if a farmer don't wish he'd kept out o' trouble when,
                        after killin' his neighbor, he reads how prominent an' well-t'-do he is.
                    Tell Binkley has loaned his bootlegger t' Tipton Bud till he gits back from

                    We'd think a whole lot more o' beauty doctors if they'd occasionally advise a
                        change o' scene fer some patients.
                    "Sorry, but I'm as crowded as th' alcoholic wing of a hospital," said
                        Landlord Gabe Craw, this mornin', when a stranger started t' register.
                    Business may finally git back t' normal, but we don't believe th' cotton

                    Th' difference between a divorce battle an' a world war is that th' newspaper

                    It's a dull day when some woman don't die in a poorhouse that used t' be th'

                    Ther's one good thing about taxesthey keep us aroused an' anxious

                    It rains on th' just an' th' just fine.

                    Some folks may not toil, but they spin jest th' same.
                    Mrs. Tilford Moots' brother sold his big farm t'day after jest makin'
                        expenses fer th' last two years. He says it's too long between world wars

                    It jest seems t' be impossible t' be great an' tidy.
                    Mrs. Tipton Bud has sent her favorite recipe fer angel cake t' th'

                    Hon. Ex-Editur Cale Fluhart successfully evaded th' issues fer three hours in
                        an eloquent address at th' monster p'litical meetin' last night.
                    
                    "Kin a mother hold a home t'gether an' be prominent in either art,
                        literature, politics, or business? O' course she kin if she jest sets her
                        mind t' it," declares Mrs. Em Moots. "I made fifty-one p'litical speeches
                        this fall as agin forty-nine last fall. My husband is missin' an' my
                        children are all happily situated. Oscar is in th' reg'lar army, Beatrice is
                        married t' a Korean priest that wears his shirt over his pantaloons an' a

                        fifty-one feet with a 16-pound shot. Any woman with a fireless cooker an' a

                    A woman allus stays longer after she gits up t' go than she does before she
                        starts t' leave.
                    "I want t' say this fer Wilson," said Hon. Ex-Editur Cale Fluhart, t'day, "No
                        President in all history ever picked as many fellers that turned out t' be
                        great intellectual giants after they died as he did."
                    Lafe Bud wuz takin' a straw vote an' he asked Miss Fawn Lippincut how she wuz
                        goin' t' vote, an' she said: "In my blue tricolette, I guess."
