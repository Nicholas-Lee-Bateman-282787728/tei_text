							<l>W<hi rend="sc">HEN</hi> Time began, "the morning stars did sing,"</l>

							<l>And sang, while Time, upon his silent wing,</l>

							<l>The towering mountain wears a golden crown,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And scattered diamonds in the valley lie:</l>
							<l>Ocean repeats the beauties of his throne,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And multiplies the gems that glow on high;</l>
							<l>In azure robes he wraps our earthly ball,</l>

							<l>The world was manufactured in six days,--</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">So read the chronicles in Genesis,--</l>
							<l>And all things in it, from the sun's bright rays</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Down to the darkest spot in the abyss,</l>

							<l rend="ti-2">Forever chained, all hopeless of release.</l>

							<l>Ah, yes; God made the world and all that's in it</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">In twice six dozen hours, just to a second;</l>
							<l>Of course He might have done it in a minute</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">If He had pleased; but how the time was reckoned,</l>
							<l>Or why just there and then He did begin it,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">We do not know. It may be that He beckoned</l>
							<l>It from Erebus, Chaos, Hell, or Night;</l>
							<l>And, being dark, He said, "Let there be light,</l>

							<l>And there was light." He then created Man.</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">According to geography by Moses</l>
							<l>The place was where four crystal rivers ran--</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">A place of sinless happiness and roses,</l>
							<l>Until the serpent came and left his bane,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">At least so many a prelate still supposes.</l>

							<l rend="ti-2">As many people think, while many doubt it;</l>

							<l rend="ti-2">But infidels and deists fain would flout it;</l>

							<l rend="ti-2">Ocean, thy flowing robe which God besprinkles</l>

							<l rend="ti-2">And, although thoughtless, deaf, and dumb, and blind,</l>
							<l>It teaches more than all the sage's ink,</l>

							<l>That this is true, as in the record stated,</l>

							and not because he was the friend of Wilkes personally.</item>
						<item n="53.">Junius wrote from some deep wound to his vanity, or hu- miliating
							mortification to his pride. Just before Junius began to write, Horace Walpole's party

							the History of the Reign of George Third.</item>
						<item n="60.">The style as well as many expressions in the "North Briton" resembles the
							letters of Junius. The "North Briton" was first attributed to Wilkes, but afterward
							settled on Horace Walpole.</item>
						<item n="61.">The letters of Junius, at the time they were published, were thought by
							many persons to be written by Horace Wal- pole, while Walpole was suspiciously busy in
							endeavoring to fasten them on <hi rend="i">William Gerard Hamilton</hi>. That Walpole
							would do so to shield himself is not an unnatural inference, and strictly in
							accordance with his general character.</item>
						<item n="62.">Junius's letters were all, with one exception, copied in the handwriting
							of a woman. Horace Walpole was in familiar intercourse with nearly all the women of
							genius, and the accomplished ladies of society, during the time of the Junius
							letters.</item>
						<item n="63.">Junius wrote nothing from August, 1770, until October, 1770. Horace
