						<l>Where angels and archangels watch and pray,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">In temples not made by hand.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>There is music unlawful for mortals to hear,</l>

						<l>And joy and peace that are void of fear,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">'Mong God's angelic band.</l>

					<lg>
						<l>There is heaven and harmony, health and hope,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">On this beautiful golden strand,</l>
						<l>Where sin and sickness, disease and death,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">All vanish at His command.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>In this beautiful home just across the way,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">We are slow to understand,</l>
						<l>That man in God's image is not made out of clay,</l>

						<l>Could I write with the pen of an angel,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Would the cruel old world stop and read,</l>
						<l>A moment, as onward it rushes,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">On its mission of crime and of greed?</l>

						<l rend="ti-2">To even the funeral knell</l>
						<l>Of the lost and the dammed and the dying?</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">When to gain this old world is the meed</l>
						<l>For which every man is contending;</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">When corruption and vice is the seed</l>
						<l>That is planted by men and by women,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And watered with tears every day;</l>
						<l>Do you think men would then stop and listen,</l>


						<pb id="VAB8207-016" n="16"/>

						<l rend="ti-2">Or pause for a moment to pray,</l>
						<l>Do you think they would care about heaven;</l>

					<lg>
						<l>Could I touch the soft cords of the lyre,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">With a touch that was surely divine,</l>
						<l>Would women look up from the mire,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Who are digging and delving like swine,</l>
						<l>In unspeakable sin and corruption,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">In crime and in lust and in greed;</l>
						<l>Would they wake for a moment to listen,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Or pause for a moment to heed</l>
						<l>A message from God and the Savior</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">They could hear in this life could they read?</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>If Christ should again speak to mortals,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">As he did by the blue Galilee,</l>
						<l>When the beauty of heavenly portals</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Was reflected on land and on sea,</l>
						<l>Would women believe on His mission,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And turn from the past in disgust,</l>
						<l>Or would they keep sowing and reaping</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">A harvest of sin and of lust?</l>


						<pb id="VAB8207-017" n="17"/>

						<l>No, women and men will not listen,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">As they stand on the tottering brink</l>
						<l>Of the chasm that leads to destruction,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Nor pause for a moment to think</l>
						<l>Of the terrible fate that awaits them,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Nor wait for one moment to heed,</l>

					<head rend="center">WHEN YOU AND I WERE FRIENDLY, BILL.</head>

					<lg>
						<l>When you and I were friendly, Bill,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">In the days of long ago,</l>
						<l>When life flowed like a river, Bill,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And there was no want or woe;</l>
						<l>When we lived down on the old rock farm,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">In the cabin on the hill;</l>
						<l>And climbed the trees, and robbed the birds,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">When we were friendly, Bill.</l>
						<l>Then life was one continued joy,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And every purling rill</l>
						<l>Was full of heaven's melody,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">When we were friendly Bill.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>When we stole old Tiner's apples, Bill,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Along the river road,</l>
						<l>And never worried 'bout the crime,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Or cared about the load</l>


						<pb id="VAB8207-148" n="140"/>

						<l>Of sin and death we carried,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">While hurrying up the hill,</l>
						<l>When life was full of beauty,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And we were friendly, Bill.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>We never dreamed that we would meet</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">As we have met today;</l>
						<l>And pass each other on the road</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Without a word to say</l>
						<l>About the days of long ago,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And the moonshine and the mill,</l>
						<l>Where we have often met at night</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">When we were friendly, Bill.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>But greed for gold broke friendship's chain,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And when we saw that angel slain,</l>
						<l>We tottered onward down the hill</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Without a thought of kindness, Bill.</l>
						<l>I saw the demon, time, oft trace</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The furrowed death mask on your face,</l>
						<l>And still forgot, as sinners will,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The days when we were friendly, Bill.</l>
					</lg>


					<pb id="VAB8207-149" n="141"/>

					<lg>
						<l rend="ti-2">But we are nearing now the goal,</l>
						<l rend="ti-3">Yet somehow, deep within my soul,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The fires of friendship smoulder still,</l>
						<l>That blazed when we were younger, Bill.</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Yes, Bill, I hope and trust and pray,</l>
						<l rend="ti-3">That God will usher forth the day</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">When you and I may meet and still</l>
						<l rend="ti-3">Forget the past in friendship, Bill.</l>

					<lg>
						<l>When the sorrows of life have o'ercome me</l>

					<lg>
						<l>And still, in my dreams, I remember</l>

						<l>Though age like the storms of December</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Has blasted my hopes with its blight;</l>
						<l>And when I arrive up in heaven</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">I would not, I could not, in sooth,</l>
						<l>Be happy unless I can welcome</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The girl that I loved in my youth.</l>

					<lg>
						<l>Jim is home from college,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And has larned the college yell,</l>
						<l>He isn't much on figures,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And he don't know how to spell,</l>
						<l>But you talk to him o' foot-ball</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And you'll find he is a sage,</l>
						<l>And they say he leads cotillions</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Like a master on the stage.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Yes, Jim is home from college,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And has larned the college yell,</l>
						<l>It took four years to do it,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">But that's doin' mighty well.</l>
						<l>If it ever comes to readin' books</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">You'll find he is a shirk,</l>
						<l>And you're sure to hurt Jim's feelin's</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">If you even hint o' work.</l>

					<lg>
						<l>We are mighty proud o' Jimmy,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And his yaller, speckled vest,</l>
						<l>As he sits among the bleachers,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Dressed in his Sunday best</l>
						<l>You can hear his voice, like thunder</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Above the deafenin' roar,</l>
						<l>That will pierce the very heavens</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">When the home team drives a score,</l>
						<l>Fer with lungs that's made o' leather</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">The atmosphere he jars,</l>
						<l>And we know he'll make a barker,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">In the depot, fer the cars.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>He is mighty shy on Latin,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And quite innocent o' Greek,</l>
						<l>And when it come to hist'ry</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">He would always take a sneak</l>
						<l>And travel fer tall timber</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Fer to save his tarnal hide.</l>
						<l>In four long years o' study</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">He never could decide</l>
						<l>Why Ceasar crossed the Delaware,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And Hannibal give Lee</l>
						<l>Sich a devil of a beatin'</l>
						<l>On the ragin' Tennessee.</l>

						<l>I got a letter late last fall</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">From that President at Yale,</l>
						<l>Fer me in haste to come at onct--</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Sed Jim was now in jail.</l>
						<l>He couldn't larn a tarnal thing,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">With knowledge all galore,</l>
						<l>But beat up all the tother nine</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">When the home team failed to score</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>He got so mad last winter,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">In that there bloody school,</l>
						<l>He telled the old man in the class</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">He was a bloomin' fool.</l>
						<l>He didn't keer for larnin',</l>
						<l>Ner want to be a sage,</l>
						<l>He'd ruther make a hundred rails</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Than read a single page.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>It cost me just a farm last year,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And all my ready cash,</l>
						<l>To pay his fines and board and keep</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">So he could take a smash</l>
						<l>At some o' them there city dudes--</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">It was agin the law</l>

					<lg>
						<l>So Jim is home from college,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And has larned the college yell;</l>
						<l>He isn't much on grammer</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">And he don't know how to spell--</l>
						<l>He nearly broke his devilish neck</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Fallin' over Latin roots,</l>
						<l>But can dance just like the mischief</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">In the old man's cow-hide boots.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l rend="ti-2">There is a feller in our town;</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">I hear his neighbors said</l>
						<l>Could write a book without no hands,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">Fer he wrote without a head.</l>
						<l>And he is a blood relation</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">To Jim, now some folks say,</l>
						<l>And big and awkward as a mule--</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">It's queer that Jim's that way.</l>
						<l>But the old man never went to school,</l>
						<l rend="ti-2">But done his level best</l>
						<l>To become a polished speaker</l>
