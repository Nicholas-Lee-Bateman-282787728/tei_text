            <p>William Clarke was distinguished as the first Chief Justice of Indiana Territory. During the time of
                    his brief tenure of that office, the territory in question included not only the present state of
                    Indiana, but also <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>, <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
               </placeName>,
                    and a portion of the present state of <placeName>
                        <country reg="mnu">Minnesota</country>
                    </placeName>. Clarke was therefore the first Chief Justice of the states mentioned as well as of
                    Indiana.</p>
            <p>A veil of mystery conceals the antecedents and early life of Justice Clarke. Intensive investigation
                    has, for example, failed to disclose any facts concerning either the date or place of his birth. No
                    evidence is available which connects him with other contemporary families of the same name. The
                    circumstances connected with his formal education are unknown. Evidence concerning the date and
                    place of his marriage like-wise appears to have disappeared. The present study must therefore be
                    confined to the last six years of his life; even for these years our information is meagre.</p>
            <p>Clarke's first appearance in public life was his appointment on December 22, 1796, by
                    President Adams, as <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    removal to Indiana Territory in 1800. From the slight amount of his correspondence now extant, it
                    would appear that his domicile until near the end of 1800 was in Bourbon County, a fact also
                    substantiated from his subscriptions as "formerly of Bourbon [County] <list type="footnotes">

                            the author hereof, that there was very little wisdom in refusing to exercise an office under

            <p>The significance of the statement in the above tribute becomes evident when viewed in relation to
                    Clarke's experience during his four years as federal prosecutor. From the beginning of his
                    term of office, he was confronted with opposition in high places.</p>
            <p>The enemies Clarke made were numerous and politically powerful, which may explain in part his failure

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. His most persistent opponent, as disclosed by the fragmentary materials which have
                    been preserved, was Harry Innes, Federal District Judge, in whose court Clarke appeared in behalf of

            <p>One explanation of the unrelenting animus of Innes towards Clarke, aside from a possible political
                    one, may be found in the latter's frequent motions for new trials of cases decided against
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> by federal juries, and in his appeals from the verdicts of juries. One type of
                    legislation involved concerned the right of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to receive duties, in addition to penalties, on stills which had not been duly entered.
                    For example, in July, 1799, Judge Innes rendered a decision on a motion by the District Attorney for
                    a new trial in the case of James Morrison <hi rend="i">v.</hi> William Trimble,<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                    in which the motion was denied.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Again, as late as June 30, 1800, there is found
                    a motion by Clarke to set aside a verdict in the Federal District Court because of
                    "manifest error" in the proceedings, a motion quickly denied by Innes. These
                    episodes doubtless prompted Innes to report to Senator <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, March 5, 1800, that James Morrison was also "well convinced of
                    Clarke's incompetency &amp; wishes to get rid of him."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were other incidents which contributed to widen the breach between Clarke and Innes. In the
                    course of his official duties, Clarke reported to the Secretary of the Treasury, in a letter which
                    has not been found, his view of the facts concerning the issues involved in the various revenue
                    cases. This provoked Judge Innes to ascertain through Thomas T. Davis, then a Representative in
                    Congress from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and later Clarke's successor as Judge in Indiana Territory, whether the
                    District Attorney had reflected in any way upon the Court. In an answer to a letter of inquiry from
                    Davis, dated January 18, 1800,<hi rend="sup">8</hi> the Secretary of the Treasury wrote on February
                    25, 1800: <text>

                                    the Judge contrary to the opinion of the District Attorney—In particular

                                    to assure you, that the representations of the District Attorney, have ever been
                                    temperate and respectful;—it was his duty to give information of the

                                    communicatting this information he has certainly given no cause of Offence to the

                    proposal in Congress to reorganize the Federal Courts, he observed that such legislation would be

                                    contemplate the appointment of another Judge—Should this be the case, I

                                    are at war with the necessary measures of Government. The embarrassments we labour

                                    it would rivet the system so completely that the evils resulting therefrom would be

                                    returned was "that, upon its being accompanied with forty dollars, it would

                    the legislative branch during the first or temporary stage of territorial government. In addition to
                    his judicial duties as first Judge of Indiana Territory, therefore, Clarke participated in the
                    making of the laws in the early part of the first stage of government. In the first session of the
                    legislature, January 2, 1801, to January 26, 1801, seven laws and three resolutions were passed and
                    signed by Governor Harrison and by one or more of the judges, including Clarke in every instance. In
                    the second session, January 30, 1802 to February 5, 1802, two additional acts were passed which he
                    also signed.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

            <p>In the last sixteen years the writer has lived in three midwestern states: <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>, <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>. During that period he has met hundreds of midwesterners with whom he has discussed
                    genealogy and specific problems in ancestry. It seems to him that nine out of every ten people to
                    whom he has talked about genealogy have one or more lines of ancestry going back through <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>, and at least half of those lines are blocked with a progenitor who "came from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>" or lived and died there. Thus it seems to him that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> has become a stumbling block to those in the Middle West, and especially in the Great
                    Lakes basin, who are attempting to trace their ancestry back to immigrants from across the ocean.
                    This paper is an attempt to sum up in a general way what has been learned about <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> genealogy in twenty-three years of poking around in the printed and unprinted records
                    of that state, in a desire to help researchers find the clues which will enable them to carry back
                    their lines another generation or two and, so to speak, get them out of <placeName>

            <p>As one's experience in genealogical research grows, one realizes more and more how essential
                    it is to efficient procedure to have some knowledge of the history of the community in which the
                    problem arises. The man or woman who can most easily solve a problem in ancestry is he or she who
                    knows the most of the historical background of that problem. That background is nothing more nor
                    less than the history of the town or region in which those ancestors lived—not so much
                    the political history as the social and economic history, for political history grows out of social
                    and economic history just as family history is part and parcel of social and economic history.</p>

                    basin, for it was explored and settled by the French (it differs in that the French settlements were
                    not permanent, although a very few of the French names persist). As a matter of fact, the same man
                    who sailed into <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> harbor on an exploring trip sixteen years before the Pilgrims landed there, was the
                    first white man to go into this territory of the Green Mountains. Samuel Champlain, born in the
                    small seaport town of Brouage in Saintonge, a province of western <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, spent his early days acquiring knowledge of the sea and navigation. He made many
                    voyages and exploring expeditions to the new world of America. On one of these, in 1608, he
                    established the first French colony on American soil at Quebec, which, incidentally, is an Algonquin
                    name meaning "narrowing of the stream." He spent that entire year exploring the
                    surrounding country. The following summer he set forth on another of these trips, and in July, 1609,
                    according to his journal, he went up the Richelieu River, where he encamped on the second of that
                    month. His journal tells of meeting some savages in canoes, and then goes on to say: "We
                    left the next day, continuing our course in the river as far as the entrance to the lake.
                    … The next day we entered the lake, which is … perhaps 50 or 60 leagues long.
                    There I saw four beautiful <pb n="16" id="VAA4025-034-1-020"/> islands 10, 12 and 15 leagues long,
                    which formerly had been inhabited by savages, like the River of the Iroquois; but they had been
                    abandoned since they had been at war with one another. … " Champlain proceeded
                    southward along the west side of the lake, touching at many points now well known, such as
                    Plattsburg. He thus became the first white man to look at the Green Mountains, or, as he called
                    them, the <hi rend="i">verts monts.</hi> The islands he speaks of are now known as Isle La Motte,
                    North Hero, and South Hero, all part of the present state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>; Vermonters almost always speak of them as "the Islands."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Following the establishment of French colonies along the Saint Lawrence Valley and the planting of
                    English colonies along the New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> coast, hunters and traders quickly took advantage of the old Indian trails through the
                    Green Mountains. Dealers in furs followed these ancient pathways which have become today the paved
                    roads over which thousands of tourists pass each year. Sometimes these French and Indian parties
                    were friendly; at other times they were bent upon mischief, and raids upon the settlements in
                    Masschusetts and <placeName>

                    region and the English on the south and east, the territory became a sort of no man's land.
                    In 1665 or 1666, the first settlement, and that of a military nature, was made when the French,
                    under Captain de La Motte, built Fort St. Anne on Isle La Motte. This was not, however, a permanent
                    settlement, as it was destroyed in 1670.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> There appears to have been no attempt

                    that the first township granted by the government of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> comprised territory formerly owned by <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> had originally acquired this land as a grant from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> in return for territory ceded to that state. In 1740, the dispute regarding the
                    boundary line between <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName> was settled by the Crown, and the present line established. Thus this infant town in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>, then called merely Number One, came under the jurisdiction of the governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName>. In the following year, 1741, a new provincial governor was sent out from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, one Benning Wentworth, who was to have much to do with the subsequent history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>It had always been understood that the province of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> was bounded on the east by the western edges of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, and consequently, when the boundary between <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> was settled by the Crown, it was supposed by the government of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName> that its western boundary was a continuation of that line. According to that, the
                    territory of the Green Mountains lay in the province of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Acting on this supposition, Governor Wentworth concluded that the unsettled region between the
                        <geogName>Connecticut River</geogName> and Lake Champlain offered him a chance to make some
                    money on the side by selling grants therein. With this in mind, he began to advertise this land, and
                    in 1749 made his first grant in that territory. This was the town of Bennington, a tract of land six
                    miles square, six miles north of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> line and twenty miles east of the Hudson River. In the next fifteen years, he made
                    approximately one hundred thirty such grants, and the territory became known as the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName> Grants, a name which stuck to it for over a generation.</p>

                    granting the lands in that region belonged to him. He, too, acted in accordance with his views and
                    likewise granted several townships in that territory.</p>
            <p>The majority of the grantees under Governor Wentworth were people earnestly seeking new homes and
                    land of their own, so they, their relatives, or friends, immediately began to settle upon the land
                    which they bought. On the other hand, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> grants were purchased by speculators and were settled, if at all, by hirelings, or by
                    people who bought land of the speculating grantees. The result was a controversy which ultimately
                    disturbed even the King's Council in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>. First <placeName>

                    </placeName> and then <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName> petitioned the King for jurisdiction, each governor continuing meanwhile to make his
                    grants. Finally, in 1764, the King in Council decreed that the <geogName>Connecticut
                    River</geogName> should form the boundary between the two provinces.</p>
            <p>By that time, however, many a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName> grantee had been living upon the land purchased long enough to get a portion of it into
                    arable condition. When a rival claimant came along from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and tried to oust him, trouble ensued. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName> grantee did not propose to pay for his land twice, the New Yorker proposed to get that
                    for which he had paid. Hot and furious waxed the controversy, but the Yorkers were outnumbered,
                    since Governor Wentworth had several years start of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Governor in his real estate business. A few years before the outbreak of the
                    Revolution, the famous Allen brothers, Ethan and Ira, not to mention their cousins, Seth Warner and
                    Remember Baker, had settled in the Grants, In defending their land titles, they organized the
                    well-known Green Mountain Boys, becoming, at least in the eyes of the government of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, an outlaw band, their coonskin caps and leather jerkins a symbol of hardihood that has
                    persisted to this day.</p>
            <p>The English government decided first one way and then the other in the matter of jurisdiction, giving
                    authority over the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> area first to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and then to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName>. The settlers, disgusted with the vacillating policy of the Crown, fought off their
                    rivals. A price was placed upon the head of Ethan Allen by the government of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. Allen, a roistering but very resourceful fellow, was <pb n="19" id="VAA4025-034-1-023"/> highly amused and issued a rival proclamation in which he jeered at the Governor. About this time
                    the Revolutionary War broke out, and the news of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Concord</settlement>
                    </placeName> flashed through the colonies. Allen, strange as it may seem, armed with a commission
                    from the Colony of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, gathered his band, attacked and captured Fort Ticonderoga, and the Grants forgot for a
                    moment their private difficulties in the defence of the country against the British. However, not
                    even the magnitude of the Revolution could eclipse the smaller revolution in the Grants. And thus
                    the Vermonters at this early date stuck to their own knitting and declined to be stampeded into a
                    national landslide.</p>
            <p>Even before the Revolution broke, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName> grantees had been meeting in conference to determine what should be done to secure
                    their land titles. Various meetings were held at various places, generally in the home of one or
                    another of the grantees who held their land under the jurisdiction of the governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName>. Later they even petitioned the Continental Congress to help them in the matter, but to
                    no avail, for the balance of power in Congress was held by representatives of states who favored <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. Finally, a convention of representatives of the various towns in the Grants was called
                    to sit at Westminster on January 15, 1777. At this convention, which was attended by such famous
                    Vermonters as Thomas Chittenden, who became first governor of the state, Ira Allen, Jonas Fay, and
                    many others of fine caliber, the matter was settled. It was at this convention that the Declaration
                    of Independence of the State was framed and ordered published! Some of the towns did not send
                    representatives, but sent proxy votes for the formation of a new state. In the words of the records

                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>." At another convention, sitting on June 4, 1777, the name was officially
                    changed to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>, a name suggested by a Dr. Thomas Young, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>

                    meaning "green mountains," was much more appropriate to the territory, besides it
                    had become known that a section of land on the Susquehanna River was also designated as New <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Thus was formed the "State of <placeName>

                    </placeName>," which was virtually an independent republic for fourteen years. The

                    was elected the first governor of the self-created state. Colonel Chittenden was the only member of
                    these early assemblies who had ever sat in a legislative body. He had been somewhat prominent in
                    town affairs in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> before he migrated to <placeName>

                    </placeName> and had represented his town in the Assembly of that colony. Moreover, he was one of
                    the most sagacious and astute men of his day. During this period repeated efforts were made to
                    secure the recognition the Vermonters so ardently desired. At one time, a few of the more
                    influential men of the "State" were even accused of treason against the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> because of their negotiations with Great Britain. Parenthetically, let it be said that
                    it is hard to see the logic of a man's being called a <pb n="21" id="VAA4025-034-1-025"/>
                    traitor to a given country when he is not recognized as a citizen of that country! The writer is,

                    </placeName> become an autonomous province of the British government. One can easily see how
                    strategic a position this would be for the British army. Here is the territory between two of the
                    rebelling states, with a long boundary line, furnishing many entries for British scouting parties
                    and armies, not to mention a lake on which naval maneuvers could be performed. The men in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> who implied an interest in the proposal were Ethan Allen, his brother, Ira Allen,
                    Thomas Chittenden, the governor, and eight or nine others. The exact intent of these men has never
                    been definitely known, but it is the writer's belief that they hoped to force the hand of
                    the Congress of the Confederation and bring about a recognition of the independence of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> and its admittance to the Confederation of States. However, they may have been playing
                    off one power against another, a game that many weak European states have played more than once. In
                    certain manuscript records in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>, one finds that some of those negotiating on behalf of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> expressed an intuition that the Vermonters were playing a game with them. Be that as it
                    may, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> did not become a British province. Incidentally, many Tory families moved to northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> about that time, thinking that they might be getting back to British soil. Finally <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> was recognized as an independent and sovereign state, and admitted to the Union in
                    1791.</p>
            <p>In this brief resumé of the history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> before statehood, it has been noted that the first permanent settlement was at Fort
                    Dummer, near Brattleboro, on the <geogName>Connecticut River</geogName>, for the French forts in the
                    Champlain Valley can not be considered as permanent settlements. The real settlement of this region
                    of the Green Mountains began when it was "made safe" by the cessation of
                    hostilities between <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> and Great Britain after the French and Indian War. Prior to this time, settlement had
                    been made hazardous by the fact that well-known Indian trails through the region were continually
                    used by raiders, and, naturally, outposts could not be properly protected.</p>
            <pb n="22" id="VAA4025-034-1-026"/>
            <p>Thus the stream of settlement begins about 1760, and pours northward from two main sources: <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>. In general, the following division of the country can be said to hold: Colonists from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> settled on the eastern slope of the Green Mountain range, in the <geogName>Connecticut
                        River Valley</geogName>; those from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> settled on the western side in the eastern part of the Champlain Valley, This does not
                    always hold true, however, for in 1770 at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Norwich</settlement>
                    </placeName>, on the east side of the mountain, there were 206 people, all of whom came from
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Mansfield</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
               </placeName>, or the vicinity of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mansfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>; at the same time, in Bennington, on the west side, the prominent families were from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>As is usual in the opening of a new territory, settlement spread up the river valleys. Thus we find
                    the older towns in the <geogName>Connecticut Valley</geogName>, in the Hudson Valley, and in the
                    Champlain Valley, and the newer towns higher in the hills and farther north.</p>
            <p>Why was <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> settled? The answer is the usual answer in this country: the desire for more and richer
                    land. Always that is the cry of the pioneer: "Land, Land, more and better land".
                    The somewhat barren hills and meadows of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> had become pretty thickly populated; younger sons, and many of them, were coming along
                    with astounding rapidity, for there was no question of race suicide in those days when economic and
                    social conditions did not prohibit large families. As these boys married and needed homes of their
                    own, some of the older farms were split, but soon that division had to cease, and the younger boys
                    had to find new communities in which to settle. So in mid-eighteenth century the first wave of
                    migration from older New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, with slight ripples of exception, was toward the newly opened territory of the Green
                    Mountains, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName> Grants as they were then called. Consequently, in some cases we find the younger sons,
                    and some of the older sons of many of the best families of the two colonies of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, and not a few from <placeName>
                        <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
                    </placeName>, migrated northward and northwesterly to take up land purchased in the new region of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Many of these early settlers went there on foot, with axe and gun in hand, to clear their land and
                    build log cabins to which they would bring their families in the succeeding year. <pb n="23" id="VAA4025-034-1-027"/> A typical case is that of the writer's own
                    great-great-great-grandfather, John Gilbert, who walked one spring with his son Nathan, from
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fairfield</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
               </placeName>, down on Long Island Sound, to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fairfield</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
               </placeName>, which is within seventy-five miles of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Montreal</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and spent the summer there clearing the land they had bought from the grantees of the
                    township. The following spring they brought the rest of the family to the cabin they had built, the
                    site of which is marked by a tall elm standing a hundred rods back of the present house of the
                    writer's family.</p>
            <p>The period of settlement extends from about 1760 to 1820, or a period spanned by approximately two
                    generations of family history. By 1820, avenues of migration to the "West," as
                    everything west of the Hudson River was called by the New Englanders of that day, had been opened,
                    and those who had wanderlust in their blood found the allurements of this West much more enticing
                    than the difficulties of farming in the rocky hills and upland meadows of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>. We find many families associated with <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> only during this sixty-year period, for some of the early settlers had caught the
                    pioneer fever, or inherited it from their immediate progenitors, and were moving westward to
                    "York State" and farther into <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, and
                    Indiana. According to the 1790 census there were 85,500 people in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>. In 1800 there were 154,500; in 1810, 217,900; and in 1820, 236,000, or nearly three
                    times the number of thirty years before. It can be seen that the period of most rapid settlement was
                    between 1790 and 1810.</p>
            <p>Some of this settlement between 1790 and 1800 was due to the general restlessness which followed the
                    Revolutionary War. A study of the matter will reveal that there is always a period of agitation and
                    moving about following a war in our history. Probably the boys came home from war and found
                    themselves irritated by the return to a quiet life, or led on by a wider vision, sought better
                    opportunities. Possibly a few could not find work at home and moved on and on in an attempt to find
                    employment or land of their own.</p>
            <p>It is not necessary to go further into the history of the settlement of <placeName>

            <p>Many of the printed sources for genealogical information regarding families that have lived in <placeName>

                    </placeName> will be familiar to some readers and some of them to all who are interested in
                    genealogy. By far the most important is Abby M. Hemenway's <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>

                        years.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Miss Hemenway was an indefatigable worker who spent the best years
                    of her life traveling over the state gathering at first hand the information which she worked into
                    her history. Many of the town histories were written by local people at Miss Hemenway's
                    request; many of her records were taken from original documents some of which have been since lost
                    or burned. A few years ago the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> Legislature, inspired by someone who realized the value of a properly made index,
                    authorized the publication of a thorough index to be made at state expense. The index now forms the
                    sixth volume, and has greatly increased the value of the set. Miss Hemenway, at the time of her
                    sudden death in 1890, had projected a sixth volume which was never published, so the <hi rend="i">Gazetteer</hi> does not cover the entire state. It must be remembered that Miss Hemenway is not
                    always accurate, as few histories of that period are accurate, for, as already mentioned, much of
                    her material was secured by interviewing "old settlers," a source of greatly
                    varying reliability. In general, however, she can be relied upon to furnish a workable clue. As she
                    worked between 1865 and 1885 gathering information, much of it came from people who were actually
                    pioneers in the state, and much of it is available in no other place, for, as in many young
                    communities, pioneer records were poorly kept.</p>

                    genealogist. An example of their usefulness may be drawn from the writer's own experience.
                    The earliest record of the settlement of his branch of the Gilbert family in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> was in 1794, according to a deed which was the first dated record he could find. In one
                    of the volumes (IV, 37) of this set he found, under date of November 7, 1792, a record that Nathan
                    Gilbert was made a member of a Committee on Road Tax in Smithfield (now part of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fairfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>), thus carrying back the date of their settlement two years. Genealogically much may
                    happen in two or three years, especially when such a record indicates that Nathan Gilbert was
                    sufficiently well known to the town's assemblyman to warrant his recommendation to the
                    Governor's Council for such an appointment. Incidentally, there are many, probably about
                    five hundred, biographical sketches of Vermonters of this period scattered throughout these eight
                    volumes. An index to these sketches is found in Volume III (pp. 459-64), and all the names of
                    persons are adequately indexed in each volume.</p>
            <p>For Revolutionary rolls there has been published John E. Goodrich's compilation of <hi rend="i">Rolls of Soldiers in the Revolutionary War, 1775-1783</hi> (Rutland, 1904), which is
                    probably better known to many of those interested in D.A.R. ancestry than it is to the writer. These
                    are not necessarily complete, for every little while a new roll of some company comes to light and
                    has to be added to the others.</p>
            <p>The pension records in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> are important to genealogists. There are two printed keys to these records, which,
                    although incomplete, are nevertheless valuable. The first major attempt to print the names of
                    pensioners of the Revolutionary War, and certain data about them, was in 1835, when a report of the
                    Secretary of War, ordered by Congress, was printed in three volumes as <hi rend="i">Senate Executive
                        Document,</hi> No. 514, first session, twenty-third Congress. For the present purpose but a

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> pensioners arranged by states, is of interest. There are one hundred sixty-four pages
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> pensioners, arranged by counties. With each name on the roll, are listed the
                    man's rank, annual allowance, sums received, description of service, date when placed on
                    pension roll, commencement of pension, age and remarks (which often constitute the date of <pb n="26" id="VAA4025-034-1-030"/> death). The second major attempt was after the data of the 1840
                    census were available, for this census included by name each pensioner then living. This list was
                    published by the Department of State in 1841, and constitutes a quarto volume of one hundred
                    ninety-five pages, again arranged by states, so it is simple enough to get at the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> records. Unfortunately there is no index.</p>
            <p>These records of Revolutionary men should be supplemented by another important list of
                    "Soldiers of the Revolutionary War Buried in <placeName>

                    not only lists all known Revolutionary soldiers who are buried in the state, but also lists the
                    names of various invalid pensioners of that war, resident in the state. This list was supplemented
                    by another in the <hi rend="i">Proceedings, 1905-1906</hi> (pp. 189-203). Unfortunately both of
                    these lists are arranged by towns, rather than by surnames, and there is no index, so they are
                    difficult to use unless one knows the locality of the individual for whom he is searching. And to it
                    must be added the four volumes of unpublished genealogical records collected by the Genealogical
                    Records Committee of the <placeName>

            <p>Many years ago an enterprising individual in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Burlington</settlement>
                    </placeName> commenced the publication of <placeName>

                    </placeName> marriage records, <pb n="27" id="VAA4025-034-1-031"/> but only one volume was ever
                    published. That contained the records for Montpelier, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Burlington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Berlin. Other sources of vital statistics will be mentioned shortly.</p>
            <p>There are always the records of the first census, that of 1790.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The user of them
                    should remember that town lines and town and county names have changed a great deal since 1790;
                    moreover the 1790's were moving days, so the location of a man in one town according to the
                    census does not mean that he could not be living fifty miles away, or even farther, the next year.
                    In using the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> volume one should know that this census was not taken in <placeName>

                    </placeName> until 1791, so, many families may appear in two different volumes of the 1790 census.
                    For instance, the writer's great-great-grandfather Soule is listed as a resident of Pawling
                    in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> volume for 1790; and again in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> volume as an inhabitant of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fairfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Because of the date of this census in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>, one can sometimes calculate to within a year the date of migration to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> from any of the other states in which the census was taken in 1790.</p>
            <p>Genealogical students are familiar with the distressingly inaccurate and unreliable
                    "genealogical and family" histories published during the last two decades of the
                    nineteenth century and on into the twentieth. <placeName>

                    </placeName> was not slighted, for Hiram Carleton published such a work for the state, which is just
                    as unreliable as dozens of other publications of that time.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> However, not
                    infrequently these very books furnish an enterprising genealogist with workable clues, so they must
                    not be disregarded entirely. They should not, however, be accepted without thorough checking as <hi rend="i">bona fide</hi> proof of a descent. It is doubtful if any of the more important
                    patriotic societies will accept a reference to one of them without substantiating evidence.</p>

                    up the state. It is to be regretted that no plan to publish such records has been developed.
                    However, many town histories have been written. The worth of these varies greatly, as does that of
                    all town histories. A brief list of such individual histories is here given.</p>

                    </placeName> records, many of them of great genealogical importance. For instance, some of the
                    petitions printed in full in this collection constitute virtual censuses of the several towns.
                    Unfortunately, there is no index.</p>
            <p>In looking for unpublished records dealing with a genealogical problem, the first thought of the
                    searcher is vital records. The Legislature of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> passed an act several years ago requiring that each town clerk copy all vital records
                    to be found among his office records and send them to the <pb n="31" id="VAA4025-034-1-035"/> office
                    of the Secretary of State. These copies were made on cards, and the cards are now filed
                    alphabetically in Montpelier. There is a woman in immediate charge of them who is thoroughly
                    familiar with them. A letter to the Department of Vital Statistics, Office of the Secretary of
                    State, Montpelier, will bring an answer and frequently the records desired, provided that not too
                    many are requested. A simple and inexpensive form of insurance of an answer is to enclose return
                    postage with the query.</p>
            <p>Theoretically all cemetery inscriptions and church records were to be copied by the town clerks, but
                    actually this was done in very few towns. In many towns the records had been destroyed by fire or
                    flood before the act became effective, and, probably, in one or two places, the clerk was careless
                    and didn't get all the records even in the town books. Since the records in Montpelier are
                    by no means complete, failure to find a record there must not discourage the searcher.</p>
            <p>As to the use of vital records, all know that clues can be developed by analogy and from records
                    which are not those of the individual sought, as for instance from the birth record of his brother
                    or sister whose name is known to the searcher.</p>
            <p>Failing vital records, and sometimes to establish relationships indicated in vital records, one must
                    turn to probate records. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> is rather peculiar in this respect, for the probate district boundary does not always
                    correspond to county lines. There are twenty probate districts in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> and only fourteen counties. A list of these districts may be found in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> Year Book formerly called Walton's Register). Since the boundaries are not
                    defined in that book, it becomes necessary for the genealogist to use an atlas and more or less
                    guess at the probate office likely to contain the wills for which he is searching. He may even have
                    to resort to the hit or miss method in writing to probate clerks. To complicate matters still
                    further, some of the early probate districts have been redistricted and the records transferred.</p>
            <p>Land records in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> are kept in the offices of the town clerks. Fortunately, because of their value in
                    preparing abstracts of title, indexes of grantees and grantors have been made in most offices, even
                    if witnesses of deeds and others mentioned in the body of the deed are not listed. Land records are
                    especially valuable in tracing a migration, and sometimes <pb n="32" id="VAA4025-034-1-036"/>
                    valuable in determining a relationship. John Doe of Sandwich, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, may buy a piece of land in Bennington, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>, and fifteen years later, calling himself John Doe of Canton, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, deed that same land to someone else. Thus there is a record of two of his moves, from
                    Sandwich to Bennington and from Bennington to Canton. Or, he may deed that same land "for
                    the natural love I bear him" to his son, Thomas Doe, and in a later deed Thomas Doe of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, may dispose of that land in Bennington, thus definitely placing Thomas Doe of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, as the son of John Doe of Bennington, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>, formerly of Sandwich, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Church records, another important mass of unpublished records, are more difficult to trace. The
                    clerkship of the church changes, records get lost, ministers move away and sometimes take the
                    records with them. Houses burn and the records perish. But the genealogist of ingenuity will find
                    them if possible, for in them are sometimes records which are missing from the town
                    books—baptisms, admissions (sometimes by letter from another church a hundred miles
                    away), dismissals (especially those by letter to another church), and burials. Try the yearbooks of
                    the various denominations, such as the Congregational Yearbook, as the first source of information
                    concerning the individual to whom it is desired to write about such records. It will save postage
                    and grief if the letter is written directly to somebody, rather than to the postmaster who has to be
                    asked to give the letter to the proper person—such letters the writer has seen accumulate
                    in one small post office in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>!</p>
            <p>In <placeName>

                    </placeName>, D. C., there is the great mass of census records, gathered every ten years since 1790.
                    The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Society in Montpelier has a photostat copy of the 1800 census of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>, and the librarian of that society will consult it for a small fee. But the other
                    census records, and especially the 1850 record, must be consulted in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and generally it is wisest and easiest to have an experienced searcher consult them.
                    The 1850 census is especially valuable, for it mentions by name each individual in the family and
                    the state in which he was born. For instance, suppose John Doe is known to have been living in
                    Bennington, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>

                    and some idea of where to find unpublished official records. Other types of records which a
                    genealogist must use have not been touched upon, for the procedure in the use of Bible records,
                    cemetery inscriptions, and similar sources is the same the country over. A good genealogist not only
                    knows how to use records, but must possess enough imagination to discover new and obscure sources,
                    and "play his hunches" in using them. Moreover, he must know enough about human
                    nature to realize that psychology plays some part in gaining access to records, or getting other
                    people to use them for him. And so, good hunting!</p>

                    Even the people who now live on the land still known as Shaker Prairie are for the most part vague
                    as to who the Shakers really were and what they believed.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The official name for the Shakers was the "United Society of the Believers in
                    Christ's Second Appearing". They were also known as "Aletheans",
                    or the "Millennial Church"; but even the members of the society accepted the name
                    "Shaker", although it was originally applied to them in ridicule of certain
                    spontaneous movements which formed a part of the ecstasy of their worship.</p>
            <p>Peaceful, idealistic, industrious people, they lived and worked together communistically in their
                    thrifty little villages, recognizing neither death nor marriage—all of which may seem
                    extremely impractical and Utopian. Yet in enforcing their opposition to marital love, the Shakers
                    became realistic enough to house the sexes in separate dormitories.</p>

            <p>The Shakers further believed in common ownership of property; in the dignity of labor for every
                    member, regardless of how high or how low his position might be in the religious organization; in
                    complete abstinence from tobacco and liquor, except for medical use; in vegetarianism; and in a
                    plain, uniform style of dress—subdued colors, with white handkerchiefs and caps for the
                    women, and loose, coarse suits for the men, whose hair was usually worn long on the neck and cut off
                    in short bangs across the forehead.</p>
            <p>The preceding summary of characteristics no doubt appears simple enough, but actually to understand
                    the Shaker conception of life it is necessary to go briefly into the history and tenets of their
                    religion. The founder of the sect was Ann Lee, who was born in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> on February 29, 1736. The daughter of a blacksmith who lived in Toad Lane, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Manchester</settlement>
                    </placeName>, she had little if any opportunity for education and went as a child to work in the
                    cotton mills. Even so, in spite of her humble origin, she was able—through a strong will
                    and an effective tongue—to exert a surprising amount of influence over her associates.</p>
            <p>After marrying a blacksmith named Stanley and losing her four children in early infancy, she turned
                    her attention to religion and became a believer in a certain Jane Wardlaw of Bolton-on-the-Moors,
                    Lancashire, who was prophesying that Christ would soon return to earth in the form of a
                    woman—as David had suggested in the Psalms. Immediately, Ann Lee began to preach the same
                    doctrine in Toad Lane, and was so successful in collecting street crowds that she was arrested and
                    imprisoned for two weeks at Old Bailey in <placeName>

                    and was thereafter to reign on earth through her—Ann Lee. This story, regardless of her
                    previous success, was too great a taxation on the faith of Toad Lane. Consequently, after
                    considerable jeering and mud-throwing had been directed toward her, she had another vision in which
                    she was advised to go to America.</p>
            <p>Accompanied by seven disciples—two women and five men besides her husband—she
                    reached <placeName>

                    </placeName> shortly before the beginning of the Revolutionary War. Not liking the city, she moved
                    into the country, and with her disciples founded the settlement of Watervliet, near
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="nyu">New
                            York</region>
               </placeName>. There, for three and a half years, she waited passively for
                    converts. In the meantime her husband left her, when she began to enforce celibacy on the grounds
                    that men must live as the angels live without any form of earthly love. Apparently Mr. Stanley was
                    only a blacksmith with little appreciation of angelic conduct.</p>
            <p>In other respects, the long period of waiting was successful. Finally, as the result of a religious
                    revival in the vicinity of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Joseph Meacham, a Baptist minister from Enfield, <placeName>

                    spiritual satisfaction. They immediately became converts and in turn won other converts so that a
                    second settlement of the followers of Ann Lee came into existence at Mount <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lebanon</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which is now considered the parent colony. By this time Ann Lee was known as
                    "Mother Ann" and her followers as "Shakers."</p>
            <p>During the Revolution, since she denounced war, refused to take the Colonial oaths, and forbade her
                    men to serve on juries,<hi rend="sup">7</hi> she was for several months imprisoned in Pough-keepsie
                    under suspicion of being a British spy. This circumstance, though at first discouraging, really
                    turned out to her great advantage—for much publicity was attached to the imprisonment of
                    "the female Christ".<hi rend="sup">8</hi> After her release in 1780, she made a

                    they had expected Mother Ann to live forever, but Joseph Meacham and Lucy Wright—to whom
                    Ann Lee had given over all authority shortly before her death—ably explained that Mother
                    Ann had not ceased to live among her people but that clothed in new glory she was still visible to
                    those who had attained the proper degree of grace.</p>
            <p>Meacham and Miss Wright then preceded to draw up a definite covenant concerning the beliefs and
                    social system of all Shakers. Many of the tenets of the covenant appear to have originated directly
                    from Ann Lee's life, her ministry, and her theories: namely, that the godhead is both male
                    and female; that Christ in the person of Mother Ann has returned to earth to establish a kingdom of
                    heaven; that the believer—after confessing his sins—is already in heaven,
                    where there is no death and no marriage; that the body is not resurrected but that those who
                    "have passed from sight" are still in communion with all believers; that active
                    evangelism is unnecessary since God will attract converts when they are needed; and that labor is a
                    sacred privilege.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>A narrative of the wholesale removal of the Eagle Creek society to Busro was written by Samuel S.
                    McClelland, one of the members of the group. The Eagle Creek settlers, having disposed of their <placeName>

                    men drove the cattle and sheep overland. The rest of the society came in two groups—the
                    first by boat to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where they unpacked their wagons and continued overland to Busro, making the entire
                    trip in twelve days; and the second came all the way by boat on the <geogName>Ohio</geogName> and
                        <geogName>Wabash Rivers</geogName>, making the trip in thirty days and enduring floods and

            <p>The enlarged Busro colony was just getting comfortably settled and organized in the summer of 1811
                    when the Indians became menacing. Two of "the brethren", when trying to retrieve
                    six horses that the Indians had stolen, lost their shoes, their hats, and almost their scalps.
                    Nevertheless, the Shakers went peacefully about the construction of a new dormitory, a sawmill, and
                    a school house. The latter was extremely necessary for there were 131 children in the colony even
                    though the theology of the society did frown upon marriage and reproduction.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>Concerning the year 1812, McClelland wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            impending danger. Of course we would not build forts unless we intended to defend them, and
                            to this our faith was entirely opposed. As our settlement was almost the frontier, many
                            thought we had better leave the ground in peace than to run the risk of being insulted and
                            abused by troops [a seizure of several horses, saddles, and axes by "the Press
                            Gang" for use at Fort Harrison was especially distressing to the brethren] or of
                            being massacred by Indians. After mature deliberation it was decided for us to move away

            <p>Two years later, however, many returned to Indiana and revived the settlement on Shaker Prairie.
                    Gradually—to accommodate groups of forty to sixty persons each—houses were
                    built as they were needed, the last and most elaborate being built in 1820, the Shaker heyday in
                    Indiana. This last mentioned structure was built of brick, made by the Shakers themselves, upon a
                    foundation of sandstone brought from the banks of the <geogName>Wabash River</geogName>. The house
                    was fifty feet square and three stories in height. The lower floor, besides having sleeping
                    apartments for twenty-four, contained a large worship hall made possible by a series of folding
                    doors, and the two upper floors together accomodated thirty-six persons. The lower hall was used for
                    devotional exercises each evening.</p>
            <p>In the framework of walnut and in the plastering—which was held in place by oak planks
                    cracked or grooved on the surface rather than by lath—expert workmanship came to light
                    when the building was finally razed in 1875.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>During the decade that followed the return to Busro in 1814, the Shakers were fairly successful and
                    happy. They engaged in agriculture, made cutlery, brooms, baskets, and linen, and operated a grist

            <p>The area which the Shakers occupied at Busro was conducive to malaria; and, after suffering several
                    bad epidemics and an alarming number of deaths, they decided to leave Busro forever. Issachar Bates,
                    who in a sense might be considered the traveling secretary of the western Shakers, recorded briefly:
                    "The removal from Busro took place in March, 1827, and oh, what a trying day it
                        was!"<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Samuel McClelland adds that, while spending the night in <placeName>

            <p>Ten years later the entire property in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> County had been disposed of, and Shakers in Indiana became a forgotten people. Many of
                    the members had disbanded. The others had gone with Issachar Bates to the settlements in <placeName>

            <p>Possibly the most famous single act of Abraham Lincoln was his issuance of the definitive
                    Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. Such a fact, however, was hardly discernible from the
                    contemporaneous reception the Proclamation received in Indiana. The Democrats denounced it in
                    comprehensive terms as unconstitutional, provocative of dissension throughout the North, and
                    therefore detrimental to the Union cause. Most of the Republicans were willing to defend the
                    measure, but relatively few were inclined to praise it with enthusiasm. Some agreed, to be sure,
                    with the radical Julian brothers, who exclaimed that "The Year of Jubilee Has
                    Come" and hailed the Proclamation as the greatest act in all history.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    emancipation policy in the Hoosier state. But most of the journalists were lukewarm and careful to
                    explain that the purpose of the war had not changed from the preservation of the Union since the
                    Proclamation was designed to weaken the Confederacy.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> In fact some Republicans
                    expressed serious doubts of the effectiveness of the measure, and even energetic Governor Morton
                    admitted in his message to the Legislature that "it remains to be seen what effect this

                            the right direction, Julian continued: "A wise policy of war is not enough.
                            Proclamations of freedom will, of themselves, accomplish little. What we need is action,
                            instant, decisive, defiant action, scourging faithless men from power, sweeping away
                            obstacles and kindling in the popular heart the fires of a new courage and hope. The
                            government should arm the colored men of the free States as well as the slaves of the South,
                            and thereby give effect to the proclamation of freedom. … " <hi rend="i">Congressional Globe,</hi> 37 Congress, 3 Session, 1064–1069.</item>

                    condition. In October, 1862, the Indiana Republicans had suffered a serious defeat in the state and
                    congressional elections, which they were inclined to attribute largely to the unsuccessful
                    prosecution of the war by the national Administration.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Although Lincoln
                    responded to this rebuke at the polls by dismissing Generals McClelland and Buell, the conservative
                    commanding generals of the main armies of the East and West respectively, the change did not bring
                    victory to the Union. On December 13 the Army of the Potomac under the command of General Burnsides
                    suffered one of the "most bloody and disastrous" reverses of the war at <placeName>

                    armies in the West fought major battles, suffered heavy losses but failed to make any perceptible
                    progress towards the suppression of the rebellion. Many thousands of Indiana soldiers had been
                    engaged in these battles and many hundreds of them had been killed or wounded. The prevailing gloom
                    and despondency deepened almost to despair, even among the Republicans.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> As the
                    people of Indiana came to the conclusion that the enormous sacrifice in life and fortune had been in

            <p>During the early weeks of 1863 the "Copperhead" element in the Democratic party
                    took advantage of this situation to make defiant attacks upon the Lincoln Administration and its war
                    program. As a result the Republicans were virtually impelled to become constant defenders of the
                    President and his policies. Public meetings were held and "Union Leagues" were
                    formed by Republicans and War Democrats to counteract the "Copperhead" activities,

                            cabinet, especially his retention of the conservative Seward. The belief spread that the
                            cabinet had not been "harmonious in regard to the method of prosecuting the
                            war" and "unquestionably" did not possess "the

                            concern and making a new one. Most of the Republicans, however, directed their criticism at
                            the retention of Seward, who, they declared, had lost the confidence of the nation because
                            he was not in favor of a vigorous war policy. <placeName>

                        <p>RESOLVED, That while we admit that the President, under the influence of the ordinary
                            infirmities of human nature, and imperfections of human judgment may have fallen into
                            mistakes, in many particulars, which have operated seriously to retard the overthrow of the
                            rebellion, we believe that, as a whole, his administration has been characterized by great
                            moderation, wisdom, caution, forbearance and the purest patriotism, and impartiality, and it
                            is the duty of all citizens, patriots, and lovers of humanity to give him their warm, hearty
                            and unwavering support to the end.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>By early spring a widespread popular reaction had set in against the obstructionist and anti-war
                    tactics of the "Copperheads".<hi rend="sup">10</hi> The people of Indiana longed
                    for peace but they wanted permanent peace, which they felt could be secured only by the restoration
                    of the Union. Therefore the adherents of the President faced the opening of the spring military
                    campaigns with renewed hope and confidence, but with a better understanding of the difficulties
                    involved than during the two previous years. Consequently, when the rejuvenated Army of the Potomac,
                    under "Fighting Joe" Hooker, the idol of the Radicals, met defeat at
                    Chancellorsville, most Republicans evinced keen disappointment but not the profound discouragement
                    and discontent of the year before.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> They were still confident of ultimate
                    victory and anxious for another trial of battle. When Lee undertook his second invasion of the

                    critic of the Administration. On June 2 the editor censured the President for not having sufficient
                    troops in reserve to follow up a victory or to recover from a reverse, and urged the immediate
                    application of conscription for that purpose. A few days later, as the situation steadily became
                    more critical, the <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> denounced the Administration's military policy
                    in most comprehensive terms, and demanded the display of more energy and efficiency or the

                    "Copperheads", the radical organ declared that earnest patriots of all parties
                    would "look at him with even more faith and confidence than ever before, to pilot our

                    friends in Indiana. They felt that he had adopted the safest and soundest method of solving a very
                    difficult problem. His program was enthusiastically welcomed as "eminently wise and
                    satisfactory" and as the product of a "gigantic mind, a towering intellect, a

            <p>The real test of President Lincoln's popularity was to come in his campaign for re-election.
                    By the beginning of 1864, many Republicans were already considering the question of his
                    renomination. The improved military situation, which presaged the victorious termination of
                    hostilities and the restoration of the Union, naturally redounded to the political advantage of the
                    Commander-in-Chief. In Indiana the Republicans or Unionists were divided roughly into three classes
                    in respect to their attitude towards the question of renomination. By far the largest class
                    comprised those who believed that "Old Abe" was, all things considered, the best
                    man to complete "the great task remaining before us". Soon after the elections of
                    1863 it became evident that the popular confidence in the President was increasing rapidly, and that
                    many people were coming to believe that he must be continued for another term. This sentiment was
                    particularly prevalent in the southern section of the State, where the Republicans were relatively
                    conservative on the war and emancipation issues. In Congress Senator Henry S. Lane was the most
                    prominent Hoosier favoring the President's re-election.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

            <p>Taking their cue from the people, several of the local journalists came out enthusiastically for
                    Lincoln's renomination, and some even placed his name at the head of their editorial
                    columns. On November 14, 1863, the <placeName>

                    <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> took the same step in more emphatic terms. On January 2, 1864, Charles
                    Powell, editor of the <hi rend="i">Herald,</hi> became one of the first to place Lincoln's
                    name at its masthead with this endorsement: "We believe that he is better qualified to lead

                        <p>The people are emphatically for Mr. LINCOLN, for another term of office, and it would be
                            unwise to not heed this fact. Almost every mechanic, merchant and farmer, together with the
                            politicians, of the country, prefer him to any other man and will labor for his re-election
                            with a zeal and indefatigability which no other candidate could possibly command. Besides
                            being the strongest man, the past history of Mr. LINCOLN demands his renomination and
                            re-election. His administration requires that endorsement from the people, and they will
                            willingly bestow it, if their preferences are not overlooked. There is no man in the whole
                            country who has the strength to oppose Mr. LINCOLN'S nomination successfully.

            </p>
            <p>Some of the Lincoln advocates, showing more enthusiasm than discretion, suggested that their champion
                    should be nominated by the acclamation of all loyal men. To accomplish this, it was proposed that
                    the separate Union State conventions should appoint presidential electors and thus obviate the
                    necessity of a national convention.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> When this plan proved impractical, the
                    Lincolnites set to work to secure instructions for their candidate from the State conventions which
                    would make his nomination in the national convention a mere formality.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
                    Naturally many postmasters and other federal office-holders, with a selfish interest involved, were
                    working for the President, but the movement also rested on a solid popular foundation.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>Another group of Republicans took a less active part in the early discussion of the presidential
                    question. Most of them were apparently friendly to the President's renomination, but some
                    felt that the agitation of the matter was either impolitic or premature. Others wanted to be in a

            <p>The third class consisted of those Republicans who preferred another candidate to Lincoln. Aside from
                    a few disgruntled office-seekers, this opposition to renomination came almost exclusively from the
                    radical wing of the party. These men believed that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been too tender toward traitors, too cautious in his prosecution of the war, too
                    slow in developing his emancipation policy.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> For the next presidency they
                    wanted a more aggressive executive, one more determined to crush the rebellion by any and every
                    means. The most extreme element of this faction comprised the small band of German Unionists who
                    bitterly opposed the President's renomination. Their attitude was expressed by the <hi rend="i">Indiana Freie Presse,</hi> when it declared: "We cannot and dare not vote for
                    Lincoln, unless we are willing to participate in the betrayal of the republic, unless we are willing
                    to remain for all future the most despicable step-children of the nation".<hi rend="sup">28</hi> The more moderate opponents of renomination, however, generally realized and sometimes
                    admitted that the vast majority of the Union men were for the President.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> They
                    exerted themselves chiefly to keep the presidential contest an open one as long as possible, so that
                    their own candidate would have a chance for the nomination in case <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s popularity should substantially wane.</p>
            <p>The only radical candidates to attract much attention in Indiana were General <placeName>

            <p>During February, however, the tone of the paper rapidly changed to one of cautious but persistent

                            are not right. He is too slow or too easy, too cautious or too tender towards traitors. Thus
                            we often feel, and doubtless thousands of others do the same. But on second, sober thought,
                            it generally turns out that Mr. Lincoln was nearest right—all things considered.
                            … We do not believe he would do a wrong act, a cruel act, or an unconstitutional
                            act, not even to save his own life—unless he was convinced that it was his duty
                            to do so for the greater good to the greater number. … For certain emergencies
                            and particular causes we may often fancy that some other man would do better than Mr.
                            Lincoln. Perhaps he would. But `in the long run', taking all things into account
                            and remembering the various interests and different classes of men and parties to deal
                            with—where would we find a man so eminently fitted for the emergency and the
                            times as Abraham Lincoln?"</item>

                    in a more official manner. In accordance with the instructions of the State Central Committee, the
                    Union men in each county met on February 13 to select delegates to the State convention. Practically
                    every county convention adopted a resolution strongly endorsing the Lincoln Administration, and a
                    considerable number of them officially declared for the President's renomination.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> No record of a county declaring against renomination has been found; even the
                    inaction of many county conventions does not generally signify opposition or lack of enthusiasm, for
                    delegates to state conventions were ordinarily uninstructed on presidential nominations. Some of
                    these bodies, moreover, did not even declare for Morton's renomination, which was very

                    fully realized that their only reasonable hope lay in preventing the convention from taking any
                    definite action on the presidential question. What is of greater importance, they knew that if they
                    lost Indiana their cause would be practically hopeless in other States. Aroused by these efforts to
                    forestall the will of the majority, the ardent Lincolnites were more than ever determined to secure

                    while the delegates and spectators were still intermingling, Cyrus M. Allen, Union candidate for
                    Congress in the first district, rushed to the platform and hastily introduced a composite resolution
                    endorsing both the Lincoln and Morton Administrations, renominating Morton and instructing the
                    delegates to the national convention for Lincoln.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Such a popular move
                    naturally brought forth tremendous enthusiasm and applause from both delegates and spectators, and
                    amidst this excitement the resolution was put to a vote and declared unanimously carried. In the
                    meantime Alexander Metzger submitted to the temporary President a counter resolution of the Germans
                    requiring the delegates to the national convention to be "perfectly free and
                    untrammelled" in their votes for President, but this resolution was never submitted to the
                        delegates.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> Later in the day the platform committee obtained the Allen
                    resolution from the Secretary of the convention, and rearranged its parts so that one resolution
                    renominated Morton and another instructed the delegates to the national convention to use all their
                    influence for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s renomination. This last resolution was unanimously adopted by the committee
                    as the fifth plank in the platform, was reported to the convention by Thompson, the chairman, and
                    was again adopted "by a perfect storm of applause."<hi rend="sup">47</hi> No

            <p>The State convention apparently had settled the "presidential question" as far as

                    denouncing the tactics of the Lincoln "agents." Their general contention was that
                    the Lincoln supporters were afraid to let the presidential question come before the convention for
                    open discussion and therefore attached the Lincoln resolution to Morton's nomination in
                    order to railroad it through on the Governor's popularity, without even an opportunity to
                    vote against it.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> Some of the Chase men maintained also that the Lincoln
                    resolution was adopted merely by a popular assemblage and not by the official convention of

                    "snap judgment" and not "a fair and honest expression of
                    opinion." That a majority of the people had come to "hurrah for Old Abe"
                    the editor admitted, but he contended that many of the delegates were opposed to the resolution

                    answering the objections of his opponents and urging all loyal men to unite behind him. They
                    emphasized his wise and far-seeing statesmanship, his firm adherence to liberty, his practical
                    judgment, his extraordinary hold upon the confidence of the people, his invaluable experience, the

                    prestige, his chief journalistic organ boldly declared: "The country at this time can

            <p>Despite the popularity of the nominee and the platform, the Unionist presidential campaign was
                    handicapped almost from the beginning. The apparent failure of the Union armies to make substantial
                    progress in crushing the Conferedacy greatly depressed the President's political prospects.
                    Consequently a widespread popular demand arose during July for the Administration to bring the war
                    to an end immediately. This peace sentiment was particularly strong in Indiana, partly due to the
                    large proportion of inhabitants of Southern birth or parentage.<hi rend="sup">78</hi> The peace
                    advocates were mostly "Copperheads" but included many wavering Unionists. When

                    expediency, the Republican press, with practical unanimity, upheld the President's position
                    and maintained that no honorable and permanent peace could be secured until the rebellion was

                    </placeName> supporters were further alarmed by dissension and apathy within the party ranks. Some
                    of the nationally prominent radical leaders, who had never fully acquiesced in the

                    this change in popular sentiment was becoming evident to Republican managers, they were still
                    anxious about the outcome of the elections. As one politician expressed it, "Our cause is

                    To counteract Democratic campaign tactics, Morton, Colfax and a dozen of the most prominent
                    Republicans wrote on September 12 to Secretary Stanton urging him to delay the draft until after the
                    election and to arrange for the return of at least fifteen thousand Indiana soldiers.<hi rend="sup">91</hi>

            <p>By the beginning of October the Republican campaigners had largely regained their confidence.<hi rend="sup">92</hi> They were attacking the "Copperheads" with increasing vigor

                    easily re-elected Morton, regained control of the Legislature, and captured four additional
                    congressional seats—and all this despite the failure to secure the postponement of the
                    draft or the return of many soldiers. On November 8 the Indiana voters gave <placeName>

                    </placeName> a twenty thousand majority over McClellan. This was a moderate gain over 1860 and real
                    comeback from the adverse vote of 1862. The most decided increase in the President's
                    supporters was in the central and the extreme southeastern sections of the state.<hi rend="sup">93</hi> Since <placeName>

                    from the radicals. Since military failure had been the most basic cause of Republican opposition,

                    world. They were just coming to realize what that leadership had meant. According to most
                    Republicans, "Mr. Lincoln enjoyed the confidence and love of the people to a greater extent
                    than any one upon whom the office of Chief Magistrate was ever conferred, and the regret at his
                    death was heightened by the fact that he had been stricken down in the midst of an unfinished

            <p>The list of members of the Indiana Historical Society in 1937, down to December 2, was published in
                    the December <hi rend="i">Indiana History Bulletin.</hi> Following this, the members of the Society
                    were asked to suggest others who ought to become members. Many suggestions were received and
                    invitations were sent to the addresses given. A very gratifying response has come from these
                    invitations. Thus far (January 24), sixty-seven have been elected to membership in the Society as a
                    result of these suggestions.</p>
            <p>This shows that there are many in Indiana, and many former residents of Indiana that now live outside
                    the state, who are ready to participate in the work and the opportunities of the Historical Society.
                    If the present members would continue to make it a point to send to the Secretary in the State
                    Library and Historical Building, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, nominations for membership, and would speak to others about the Society as opportunity
                    offers, the membership list could easily be increased to 1500 or 2000, greatly to the advantage of
                    historical interests in Indiana.</p>
            <p>The roster of the members in the December <hi rend="i">Indiana History Buletin</hi> reveals the fact
                    that <placeName>

                    </placeName> counties seem to have a fair portion of members. It is a source of regret that no

            <p>Among the most valuable privileges of membership in the Society is the receipt of the quarterly <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> published by Indiana University. The regular
                    subscription price is $2.00, the same amount as the annual membership dues of the
                    Society. The editor of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> makes a generous offer to all high schools of
                    the state for the year 1938—that if four new memberships in the Society are secured in or
                    by any high school, a copy of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> will be sent to the high school itself
                    without charge. The <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> is one of the most interesting and important sources
                    of information <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-034-1-070"/> for Indiana history. It should be in every high
                    school library and a great many high schools of the state should avail themselves of this offer.</p>
            <p>In December, Number 2 of Volume I of the <hi rend="i">Prehistory Research Series</hi> was published,
                        <hi rend="i">Jacob Piatt Dunn: His Miami Language Studies and Indian Manuscript Collection,</hi>
                    by Caroline Dunn of the Indiana State Library; and, in January, Number 3 of Volume I, <hi rend="i">Shawnee Stems and the Jacob P. Dunn Miami Dictionary, Part I, Stems in p-,</hi> by C. F.
                    Voegelin of DePauw University. These are noticed elsewhere in the <hi rend="i">Magazine.</hi> It
                    should be noted that it is Dr. Voegelin's intention in Part I and the following parts of
                    his studies to publish the whole of the late Mr. Dunn's Miami Dictionary. Mr. Dunn left
                    this Dictionary in manuscript on cards arranged in the order English-Miami. Dr. Voegelin, a trained
                    philologist, is making a protracted study of the relaton of the languages and dialects spoken by
                    different Indian tribes, working especially with the stems. The order of publication, therefore, is
                    not Mr. Dunn's English-Miami order, but an order based on stems, and, for this purpose,
                    Shawnee stems have been chosen. Dr. Voegelin's <hi rend="i">Shawnee Stems and the Jacob P.
                        Dunn Miami Dictionary,</hi> being a technical study and of interest to a limited number of
                    scholars, is being mailed only to those requesting it. All members of the Historical Society are
                    entitled to regular publications of the Society without charge; they may obtain this by writing to

            <head>History Teachers' Forum TEXT BOOKS IN AMERICAN HISTORY<hi rend="sup">*</hi>
            </head>
            <p>There is a general course in American history in every high school and college in Indiana. This means
                    that a great many students are using texts that cover our history from the period of discovery and
                    exploration until some recent year. All of the high schools of the state use the same text, while
                    the history department of each college chooses for itself. It is of great importance that such texts
                    be accurate and well written, and it is of equal importance that they be used wisely. Better results
                    will flow from a poor text skillfully used and supplemented by a strong teacher, than from a fine
                    text in the hands of a bungling, weak instructor.</p>
            <p>There can be no two opinions in regard to the matter of accuracy. All are agreed that every effort
                    should be made to eliminate misstatements of fact. There will, of course, always be matter in any
                    text that further research will prove to be erroneous, but this does not excuse the authors of
                    school histories for perpetuating statements that have been proved to be untrue or for repeating
                    interpretations that have been demonstrated to be unsound. It is not necessary that a high school or
                    college text in history shall be written by one whose scholarship is widely recognized, but, if not,
                    the author should be one who has thoroughly checked his account by using the writings of those who
                    have done extensive research.</p>
            <p>It is likewise axiomatic that a text in history should be well written. This does not necessarily
                    mean that the narrative should be intensely interesting, but rather that the language should be
                    clear, the sentences smoothly constructed, and the matter well organized. An excellent book is
                    sometimes condemned because it does not impell students to read it by reason of the fascinating
                    manner in which the story is told. Teachers often voice this criticism, and frequently without
                    justification. There is no reason why any classes should be burdened with dull and clumsily written
                    texts in American history, and such volumes are very properly regarded with marked disfavor. On the
                    other hand, a well organized text, written in clear English by an author who knows his subject, is
                    often far superior to a text which presents the story in a <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">*</hi> This is the first of a series of four short articles
                            which will appear in this department during 1938, all relating to high school and college
                            texts in general courses in history.</item>
               </list>
                    <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-034-1-073"/> more gripping style. After all, text books are written to be
                    studied, not just to be read. Any able teacher should get along well with a text that is rich in
                    content, which is, in fact, the most desirable quality that a high school or college history can
                    possess.</p>
            <p>One of the problems that confronts the writer of a history text is the great variation in library
                    facilities of the schools that may use the book when published. This fact is closely related to the
                    preparation of lists of references, questions, lesson plans, and suggestions for teachers. Possibly
                    such aids to study and teaching should be published separately from the history texts. This would
                    permit the publication of two pamphlets, one made up of references, suggestions and directions for
                    smaller schools and the other for larger schools. This would enable the authors and publishers to
                    furnish more suitable aids to teaching for use in both large and small schools.</p>
            <p>The best high school and college histories often fail signally in the matter of lists of references.
                    These lists are, it would seem, frequently made up by assistants of the authors and not inspected
                    closely enough. The lists published in numerous texts include too many dull, dry, out-of-date,
                    non-scholarly histories and biographies. Most high school and college students who can be prevailed
                    upon to do a considerable amount of collateral reading should not waste their time on biographies or
                    histories that have been superseded by far better works embodying the results of research done in
                    recent years. To give examples, there is hardly a high school or college text in American history
                    that does not give a blanket indorsement to the "Statesmen Series" of American
                    biography or to J. P. Gordy's <hi rend="i">Political History of the <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        </placeName>,</hi> by including them in the chapter references or general bibliography without
                    comment. This would not be so bad if there were not so many omissions of more recent volumes that
                    are fresher and based on more extensive research. Teachers of history often order library books from
                    the lists of references included in history texts, and thus invest limited funds in inferior reading
                    matter when much better is available at no greater cost. There is apt to be valuable matter in older
                    biographies, monographs and large general works which students in advanced college courses may be
                    encouraged to cull out, but students taking high school courses or college students <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-034-1-074"/> taking general courses should not be asked to read antiquated histories
                    and biographies. The wise instructor who gives general courses in American History in high school or
                    college will not blindly follow the suggestions of the authors of text books, no matter how valuable
                    the content of such texts may be.</p>

                        <p>A looker on one afternoon at a game of "base ball" played on the
                                    grounds of the National B. B. Club, directly in the rear of the White House, I heard
                                    every few seconds the report of firearms, and soon perceived Father Abraham engaged
                                    in target practice. The weapon used was a smooth-bore, load at the breech, with the
                                    largest cock I ever saw on any piece, although it kicked unmercifully. The
                                    Rail-Splitter done some tall shooting, and "plumbed the center"
                                    several times, which seemed to tickle him prodigiously. The target used was one of
                                    his proclamations—the center of this "Bull's
                                    eye" being a "little joke."</p>
                        <p>Obtaining a pass from Col. Baker, I visited the old Capitol prison, and a sight the
                                    inside of that box was, sure enough; Barnum's Museum is `no whar'.
                                    A motley crew of all ages, sizes, and colors, from every State in the Union and (at
                                    present) out; also the territories. There were civilians and soldiers of Yankeeland
                                    and Dixie, and a "right smart sprinklin" of Sambo. Europe was
                                    represented by some hard-looking chaps, among others I particularly noticed a
                                    Spaniard, that from his demoniac look, no doubt entered upon his career of crime by
                                    cutting the throat of his mother. In the female department were two persimmon-eaters

                                    keen as a falcon's, long finger nails; I thought of tendering the use of my
                                    knife to pare the claws but was actually afraid to. What a magnificent pair of hawks
                                    were spoiled. The biggest one having eyed me savagely, asked, "Kin you give
                                    me a chew bacca, Cap?" "Don't use the weed that

                                    Judy?" Laughing like a hyena, Judy broke out with—"What

                        <p>The Navy Yard has many objects of interest, amongst others four cannon captured by

                        <p>The Arsenal is a delightful place to pass a summer afternoon. At the farther end of
                                    the long shaded walk a bright brass twelve-pound howitzer stares you in the face. It
                                    formerly belonged to Bragg's Battery, and was one of the "dogs of
                                    war" that sent a "little more grape" into the Mexican

                                    celebrated Hotchkiss shell, what soldiers call "hell screamers,"
                                    was testing the qualities of his invention <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-034-1-077"/> (with
                                    an improvement) out of a thirty pound Parrott. 'Tis much more interesting,
                                    though not as exciting, to hear the shriek of these missiles when you are a

                        <p>From the National Observatory, with the excellent spy-glass for use of visitors,
                                    there is a magnificent view of <placeName>

                           </placeName>, and their surroundings. Innumerable forts,

                                    revolves—inside this is a huge telescope, and many other astronomical
                                    instuments. At ten minutes to twelve o'clock (noon), a black ball three
                                    feet in diameter is hoisted to the top of the flag-staff, visible all over both

                                    time"—it is lowered quickly. Towards noon you can hear citizens
                                    enquire if the "nigger head" is up yet. The porter at this place
                                    is an "intelligent contraband." I mean, really so, and amused me
                                    not a little with the account of his flight to Abraham's bosom.

                                    and tall, and that ain't all! Most of the private houses in the city were
                                    owned by the secesh and have been confiscated, the Government using them for

                        <p>Our encampment is about four miles east of Warrenton, on the W. J. R. R.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The weather has been delightful, but it can't last
                                    long—even now Heaven's artillery is rumbling, and stormy times
                                    are near at hand.</p>
                        <p>Our sutler came up last night with a huge supply of "Old Scotch
                                    Ale" and Sherry. There was a lively and happy time in camp for a spell, I
                                    assure you.</p>
                        <p>The woods in our rear took fire this P.M. and burned fiercely until the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                                    </placeName> Garabildi Guards, sent out as skirmishers, put down the destructive
                                    element.</p>
                        <p>Stones abound all over this God forsaken State; at this particular spot not a square
                                    foot of the "sacred soil" is visible. They are in great demand
                                    just now for building chimneys to our rag houses. We have a fine supply of rails
                                    from the neighboring farms of rebellious Virginians. Company quarters throughout the "<placeName>
                                        <country reg="gi">Gibraltar</country>
                                    </placeName> Brigade" are heaped with 'em, piled high. To-day an
                                    order came from the Provost Marshal General to return the
                                    "splinters" instanter. When the regimental wagons drove up to haul
                                    'em back, 'twas discovered that not a <hi rend="i">whole rail</hi>
                                    was there to be found in the numerous heaps. The old brigade was not to be cheated
                                    out of their favorite fuel—won't freeze, if it does turn cold,
                                    not they. There are not five axes in our regiment and those we have are worthless.
                                    How in the devil does the Provost Marshal General A. P.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> suppose
                                    we could obtain wood? I am always in favor of burning Old Virginny
                                    rails—love to see the greedy flames lick 'em
                                    up—cannot be excelled for fuel, and in fact 'tis the only
                                    "Greek Fire" we of the A.P. can use on the rebels—at

                        <p>We broke up camp near Kelly's Ford, Rappahannock river, early on the morning
                                    of the 26th of November, and sunrise found us miles away toward Germania Ford, on
                                    the Rapid Ann. We crossed without opposition at 3 o'clock that afternoon
                                    and bivouacked in a dense pine and cedar thicket; 'twas a clear, cold
                                    night, and the bright, full moon made all things glisten with her pure silver rays.

                                    was soon opened. The "Johnny's" held their ground for
                                    some time, bat reinforcements were thrown forward, a charge made, and the
                                    "Rebs" fell back a short distance; 'twas

                                    artillery pitching over an occasional shell. We lay on a high ridge and looked on.

                                    but they still maintained an unbroken line and kept up their fire. 'Twas a

                                    </placeName>—the night was cloudy and bitter cold; we lay behind an old
                                    rail fence all night—no fires, of course. At early dawn our line moved
                                    forward and found the "Johnnys" had retired during the night. On
                                    we went in line for two miles through thickets, dark pine-woods and fields of
                                    stubble; four "Rebs" were captured, and at 7 o'clock we
                                    found the "Johnnys" strongly posted, on a steep hill, formidable
                                    earth-works and a strong line of skirmishers on a low ridge, some five hundred yards
                                    in front, awaiting our approach.</p>
                        <p>I never saw a more imposing sight—the red battle-flags, with the large
                                    white cross in the centre, flying—a long, dark column of men, their
                                    bright arms gleaming in the morning sun—the dark and frowning muzzles of
                                    eighteen or twenty pieces of artillery, and all as quiet and still as though not a

                        <p>Our Brigade bugle sounded—"Halt!" And the two armies
                                    stood and gazed at each other for several moments. I could hear the artillery
                                    rumbling in our rear, and the steady tramp of our gallant boys of the 3rd Division
                                    (our support). "Forward! Double quick!" screamed the
                                    bugle—and we smashed into the skirmish line and drove it back. Bang!
                                    Bang! bang! whiz! whack! a rebel battery had opened on us. "Lie
                                    down!" blew the bugle, and down we went in the tall grass, willows and
                                    along the fence rows—some behind a house and out buildings that lay
                                    between the opposing forces; there we lay all day long and popped away. The distance
                                    to the rebel lines was about seven hundred yards, or perhaps not over four, on an
                                        <hi rend="i">air line.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>An attack in force was not contemplated, it seems, but we did not then and there know
                                    that. Several men wounded in the sharp shooting that day, and not a man but had
                                    scores of narrow escapes; the "Gibralters" ransacked the house
                                    from top to bottom, though bullets were whacking against and through it all day.
                                    Your correspondent had a huge piece of bread and butter for his dinner.</p>
                        <p>At night we were relieved. It had rained hard part of the afternoon and we were glad
                                    to fall back and cook supper.</p>
                        <p>Aroused at 4 A.M. we marched all day, away down to the rebels' right
                                    wing—arrived there just at sun down and found the
                                    "Johnnys" coming in, too, on a double quick, in front of us. Their
                                    battery gave us and the setting sun a parting salute for the day. We threw up a
                                    fence rail breastwork, and without fire lay down to sleep; 'twas a very
                                    severe night—a heavy frost, and we exposed on a bare hill in a <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-034-1-081"/> large field; but little sleep any of us got, though we
                                    were tired enough. In front of us lay a dead soldier of the 1st division, shot
                                    through the brain—their skirmishers had preceded us.</p>
                        <p>Monday, Nov. 30th, aroused at 3 A.M.—formed line of
                                    battle—three lines rather; we were in the <hi rend="i">second</hi> line;
                                    moved up within about six hundred yards of the rebel works; stacked arms and piled
                                    knapsacks. The orders were that there would be a grand charge of 28,000 men at 8
                                    o'clock. A narrow cedar-covered ridge hid us from view of the rebels. In
                                    advance of this strong line of our skirmishers were deployed. 8 o'clock
                                    came—no bugle sounded the charge. Gen. <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                                    </placeName>, our corps commander, rode along the lines; everybody was busily
                                    engaged in trying to keep from freezing, pacing quickly up and down. By noon most of
                                    us had crept to the top of the ridge and obtained a full view of the <hi rend="i">work</hi> and works before us. The charge would have resulted in another <placeName>

                                    </placeName>—all agree on that. Even as savage and reckless as all had
                                    become, consequent on hunger, cold and exposure, it would have been impossible to
                                    carry and <hi rend="i">hold</hi> those works. At 7 P.M. we fell back half a mile;
                                    next day threw up entrenchments and lay, behind them till 8 P.M., when the "<placeName>

                                    "skee-daddle" for the Rapid Ann [Rapidan]. All night long we
                                    marched—along side of us the 3rd Corps—no halt—and
                                    at sun rise Wednesday, Dec. 2nd, recrossed that river at Ellis', or
                                    Culpeper Gold Mine ford. 'Twas a hard march of about twenty-two miles.</p>
                        <p>These gold mines were worked up to within about twelve months since. On the river
                                    bank there is quite an extensive establishment for washing, &amp;c., with all
                                    the washers and other mining implements scattered around. A "Union
                                    man" and his family, living here, crossed to the north side with us;
                                    'tis the first opportunity he has had of escaping from the
                                    "Johnny" Confederacy.</p>
                        <p>Breakfast two miles from the river—then pushed on to this, our old camp,
                                    reaching it weary and foot-sore at dusk—distance marched since 8
                                    o'clock of the previous evening, 32 miles, with knapsacks, and a good part
                                    of the time four columns abreast—and it must be remembered over old <placeName>

                        <p>Thursday, Dec. 3d—obtained some boards and put up a

                        <p>Friday, Dec. 4th—Orderly Gundrum and I worked hard all day and nearly
                                    finished a fire-place and chimney to our log hut. Orders to march at daylight.</p>
                        <p>Saturday, Dec. 5th—Marched as per orders. After traveling about 3 miles,
                                    reached the miserable village of Stevensburg, about five miles south-west of Brandy
                                    Station, 0. and A. and Culpeper R. R., and the same distance south-east of the town
                                    of Culpeper. We halted in a dirty, filthy, old cavalry camp—no wood, no
                                    water, no nothing; in fact, 'tis a h—–1 of a place,
                                    and colder than <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. The distance from Morton's ford, Rapid Ann river, is about
                                    four miles.</p>
                        <p>I am writing in the cold, and am not in the best of humor either, I assure you.</p>
                        <p>We are under orders to be ready to move at short notice. Oh! <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-034-1-082"/> for a stiff "snifter" of

                        <p>I had forgotten to mention that the only loss sustained by our regiment in the
                                    weeks' campaign south of the Rapid Ann, was, 1st Lieut. Geo. Rotramel, Co.
                                    F., a brave officer, a gentleman in every sense of the word, and a comrade beloved
                                    by all. He was mortally wounded near Locust Grove or Robertson's farm,
                                    where the first skirmishing commenced. Thos. Piety, of Co. G, was one of the detail
                                    under command of Lt. Rotramel, and although this two-hundred and five pound six-feet
                                    two inches high corporal was closely "nipped" several times by
                                    rebel bullets, he escaped unhurt.</p>
                        <p>All the farms south of the Rapid Ann were laid waste, and the inhabitants made
                                    acquainted with the "cruel war" and the "thieving
                                    Yankees"—guess there is "weeping and wailing and
                                    gnashing of teeth" over there now.</p>
                        <p>I wish I could re-write this letter. I would endeavor to make it more interesting;
                                    'tis a scrawl gotten up under difficulties, and no mistake. So with a
                                    hearty wish for the welfare of all at home, and the hope that the
                                    "General" will not invest in Swan's down because
                                    'tis fashionable.</p>

                                    keep the west wind off, and a forest of heavy timber in the rear. Hail columbia!
                                    What a din of axes and crashing of falling timber on all sides! The Western boys are
                                    adapts at "blocking up" shanties in a hurry. We all felt at home
                                    when the arms were stacked beneath the tall chestnut oaks, the camp staked off, and
                                    orders issued to build "winter quarters"—whilst the

                                    officer for the regiment, to ascertain how many of the "veterans"
                                        <hi rend="i">present</hi> will re-enlist for "three years or during the
                                    war." Can't say how many will "go
                                    in"—probably not many—the boys most all want to have
                                    a "4th of July" at home, and that 4th the <hi rend="i">next 4th

                        <p>Major General William S. French, formerly our Division commander, now in command of
                                    the 3d Corps, ordered some time since a new set of arms for this
                                    regiment—breech loading rifles—a high compliment to the
                                    Hoosiers, who never forget to cheer their brave old commander when by chance he
                                    passes along their line. The arms are now in <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, awaiting shipment. The boys will be proud of their new guns and our
                                    recruiting officers at home had better drill their squads of <hi rend="i">one</hi>
                                    or more in the breech-loading exercise. Not an unpleasant task for 'em, I

                        <p>We are blessed with a most extraordinary "spell" of fine weather
                                    just now, and excellent rations too—vegetables, such as onions and
                                    potatoes in abundance. These were much needed by the men after their long diet on
                                    "marching rations" of crackers and pork. Verily the commissariat
                                    must have fallen into new and <hi rend="i">honest</hi> hands. The
                                    "robbers" have had their day—this Brigade has suffered
                                    its full share from d—–d rascals in the commissary department.
                                    Hurrah for the change! Sutlers are here by the gross, with heaps of

                                    though it be on the eve of a great battle and under the very guns of the enemy. <hi rend="i">Forty-two</hi> answered to "roll call" that night in

                        <p>Mr. John Rotramel, brother of Lt. George Rotramel, of Co. "F."
                                    arrived in camp from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Carlisle</settlement>

                                    remains of his brother. 'Tis extremely doubtful whether Gen. Lee will allow
                                    a flag of truce so far within his lines for that purpose. The Lieuto lies buried
                                    some twelve or fifteen miles south of the Rapid Ann.</p>
                        <p>Here are two incidents that occurred during our last "raid" into
                                    Dixie that may prove worth publishing:—two soldiers, one of the 7th and
                                    the other of the 14th Indiana, were pulling heads of cabbages from a hole in the
                                    garden right on our skirmish line at Mine Run. The 7th Hoosier being nearest to the
                                    "fruit," had several fine cabbage unearthed when the bullet of a
                                    rebel sharpshooter broke his leg. He begged most piteously to be carried out of
                                    "range" but hungry-for-greens Hoosier No. 2 couldn't see
                                    it, and grabbing the pile of vegetables, made off on double quick for a safer
                                    locality.</p>
                        <p>As we were hurrying along about midnight, Tuesday, Dec. 1st, two corps side by side,
                                    on the Chancellorsville plank road, making for the Rapid Ann, a soldier
                                    "belonging to some regiment in the Sd corps stumbled and came down on the
                                    rough hard planks with a tremendous thump, his gun clattering after him. The poor
                                    devil fairly bounced again, so quick and heavy was the fall. A dozen comrades were
                                    compelled to trample over him, going at the rate we all were, before he could regain
                                    his feet. I heard a wide-awake and always ready "Knutt" in the
                                    14th sing out—"What the devil are you laying down there
                                    for?" The re joiner consigned the 14th man to a very warm corner in
                                    Lucifer's dominions. Devilish little sympathy soldiers have for
                                    unfortunates—especially when on the go. I hear some speculating soldier
                                    crying—"Here's your fresh oysters, only
                                    $1.10 cts per half can!" <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-034-1-085"/>

                                    us. Many changes have taken place in the regiment since last I wrote—the
                                    "Veteran Volunteer" excitement had its day, and a "heavy
                                    run," too! Some sixty of as "good and true" men as the
                                    14th can boast of re-enlisted for the war. The inducements held out to old soldiers
                                    were indeed great, and such as no government ever offered before. The bounty was
                                    liberal in the extreme; in fact, taken altogether, four hundred and two dollars and
                                        <hi rend="i">thirty</hi> days at <hi rend="i">home,</hi> with <hi rend="i">free</hi> transportation to and from, was a "big thing," and no
                                    mistake. We have some fifty or sixty men whose term of service does not expire for
                                    twelve months to come, so the probability is the organization will remain intact,
                                    and our decimated ranks filled "chock up" with ye conscripts.

                        <p>A rough night, in sleet and snow, on picket, suggested the above. Duty is rougher,

                        <p>Saturday morning, 6th inst., cold, raw, and drizzling, found us with blankets slung,
                                    three days' rations, and in rapid motion toward the Rapid Ann, which stream
                                    we forded, waist deep, at noon. Wagh! Cold is no name for it.</p>
                        <p>The Third Brigade of our Division had the advance, and a warm time of it they were
                                    having with the "Johnnys" as we crossed. As we advanced to their
                                    support, the enemy shelled us briskly. The river was too deep and swift for our
                                    artillery to cross, and we had no pontoons. However, the big guns lent us all the
                                    aid in their power from the north bank, and Capt. Arnold's battery of
                                    twelve pound howitzers delivered regular (as the boys say) "vollies of
                                    six-pounders," but the "Johnnys" knowing their advantage,
                                    after three brigades were across, opened a tremendous fire on us from their
                                    artillery and made a charge—but the Third Brigade stood their ground
                                    manfully, and were not to be driven easily from their position. We being their
                                    support, caught it heavily—the regiment losing fifteen killed and wounded
                                    without a chance of returning a shot. Long after dark the opposing lines continued
                                    the contest, the bright flashes from their guns presenting in the deepening gloom a
                                    splendid sight, though the contents of at least one-half of those iron tubes
                                    whistling, humming, and "nipping" around was, to say the least,
                                    unpleasant.</p>
                        <p>At 10 o'clock we withdrew to the north bank, lay down in the mud, wet
                                    through, and chilled to the very bone. Spent the day Sunday in watching the
                                    "Johnnys" across the "drink" [river], and the
                                    compliments of the season exchanged by the hostile batteries. At night, returned to
                                    camp through unfathomable mud, over stumps and stones, stumbling and cursing along
                                    in one of the darkest of dark nights.</p>
                        <p>Corporal Thos. Piety, of Co. G, was wounded in the right foot on the advance skirmish
                                    line.</p>
                        <p>Lieut. Andrews, of Co. B, had his belt clasp perforated by a bullet, which, passing
                                    through his coat, pants, drawers, and shirt bruised his abdomen severely, but most
                                    fortunately lost its penetrating power when it reached the flesh.</p>
                        <p>It is very unhealthy on the south bank of the Rapid Ann, and one runs great risk of
                                    his life in penetrating the country to any extent; <list type="footnotes">

                                            of the war, &amp;c. It was a severe rebuke to those bigots and fanatics
                                            who are continually trying to poison the minds of the soldiers against a

                                            to their own business—that it was not his province to Quarrel
                                            with men on account of a difference of opinion—that he claimed

                                    and a five-cent Havana 'twixt his teeth. After the warmest of friendly

                                    the Monumental City, in my humble opinion, is filled to overflowing with
                                    strawberries and cream, with or without sugar, and the words "No
                                    Admittance" are not visible. Open doors is the order of the day and <hi rend="i">night.</hi> Seek and ye shall find; and there is no lack of
                                    "signs"—he that runs may read. Hurrah for <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                                    </placeName>! I had two 4th of Julys there, and other things by gross, dozen, half
                                    dozen, raw, stewed, smothered, with sauce and without, and hugely did the boy enjoy
                                    all these blessings, by night and by day—running, standing, flying, and
                                    otherwise.</p>
                        <p>Who could not enjoy life under such rose-colored circumstances? Alas! the time for my
                                    departure arrived entirely too d—–d soon; and here I am at the
                                    "Mystic Front," and a canteen of "Commissary"
                                    the only comforter. Tan-bark, juice, tar-water, turpentine, brown sugar, lamp-oil
                                    and alcohol are the ingredients. After a hearty swig, a fellow feels as though some
                                    one was inside, striking two flints together—the fire flying out of his
                                    eyes. Price, 50 cents, in rag currency, per quart.</p>
                        <p>I know men who have imbibed so much that hair has actually grown on their teeth. I am
                                    using it for the express purpose of testing its qualities as a restorative, but have
                                    little confidence in its virtues. At present there are no signs of
                                    "har" visible, and several quarts have been disposed of.</p>
                        <p>Ye Paymaster, with a huge pile of greenbacks, made all of us rejoice tother day by
                                    replenishing our pocket-books.</p>
                        <p>"Vet. Vol." private Asher W. Foster, Co. "G," has
                                    returned from his thirty-five days' furlough.</p>
                        <p>I have heard a rumor that your office has been demolished by the soldiers. Hope
                                    'tis untrue; am sure none of the 1st Brigade could be induced by cowardly,
                                    street loafers (who blow about their loyalty and love for this Union and the old
                                    flag, yet dare not fight to maintain either) to commit such an act of ruffianism.</p>
                        <p>I should like to take another duck hunt; will, too—man never goes under
                                    till his time conies. General says that is "every other time."

                                    by the 2d corps passed by this hospital this forenoon.</p>

                        <p>Having reached the "City of Magnificent Distances" and taken up
                                    quarters where things are, to say the least, most comfortable, I proceed according

                                    "Wilderness."</p>
                        <p>Our regiment, the 14th Indiana, crossed the Rapidan for the fifth time about 8
                                    o'clock on the morning of the 4th of May, having broken up camp at 11
                                    o'clock the night previous. The sun shone bright and warm, and the veterans
                                    of a score of battles soon began to lighten their loads; and from this date till I
                                    left the front (11th inst.), the roads were strewn thickly with U. S. blankets,
                                    shelter tents, over-coats, and clothing of every description. I never saw anything
                                    to equal it—the old soldiers of the army carry nothing now but arms,
                                    ammunition, and the grub-bag (haversack).</p>
                        <p>We bivouacked the night of the 4th on the old battle-field, one mile south of
                                    Chancellorsville. The woods were strewn with the skeletons of comrades killed here

                                    commenced a brisk skirmish with the enemy, both sides using artillery. This fire
                                    opened at precisely 12 o'clock, and the noise of either cannon or musketry
                                    had never entirely ceased either day or night when I left the army for <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Fredericksburg</settlement>
                                    </placeName> hospital—an interval of seven days!</p>
                        <p>Countermarching, we again passed the hotel mentioned above, and moved off at
                                    double-quick in a due westerly course—heavy cavalry fighting all along
                                    our flank; and the scary riders (all were not by any means) having had enough for
                                    the day, were constantly seen riding furiously to the rear, and nearly all capless.</p>
                        <p>At 4 o'clock a tremendous musketry fire opened, with occasional discharges
                                    of artillery directly in our front. In a few moments, out of breath and heated to a
                                    perfect glow, we reached Brock's Roads, and piling knapsacks, dashed into
                                    the fight, the left of our regiment saving two pieces of artillery directly on the
                                    plank-road, that were under a terrible fire from the enemy's
                                    sharp-shooters, they having killed all the horses and disabled the cannoniers. After
                                    blazing away until dark, we were relieved by a strong, double line of skirmishers,
                                    and without withdrawing from our positions, slept on our arms.</p>
                        <p>Ammunition was distributed at 3 A.M., and soon after the musket fight again opened
                                    with redoubled fury. This was kept up with varying success till 2 P.M., neither
                                    party seeming to gain much advantage. The thick undergrowth of black-jacks was
                                    literally mowed down with balls, and the ground so often charged over taken and
                                    re-taken, covered with dead and dying men and horses. The woods taking fire,
                                    compelled both sides to cease firing. Our men fell back to the road running east and
                                    west, and threw up a long line of entrenchments. At 4 o'clock our brigade
                                    took a position some 400 yards in rear of this, stacked arms, and the men were
                                    cooking the first meal for over twenty-four hours, when again the heavy vollies
                                    began to roll off in front. Longstreet's whole corps were making a grand
                                    charge on our centre—the advance line had driven part of the 1st division
                                    out of the hastily constructed breastworks, immediately in our front, when the four
                                    old vneteran regiments of Carroll's brigade (the 4th and 8th <placeName>

                                    </placeName> Vet. Vols., and 14th Indiana) sprang to their arms, and with a cheer
                                    that made the old woods ring, drove the bold soldiers of Longstreet over the
                                    structure again and broke their line. Many dead rebels were left lying across the
                                    breast-works—amongst them a major, and two captains. Two stands of colors
                                    were captured. This, with the exception of the never-ceasing skirmishing,
                                    picket-firing, and sharp-shooting, ended the conflict at this point.</p>
                        <p>On the 7th we lay quiet all day—the skirmishing was so heavy in front that
                                    many times during the day the men would, without command, gather around the
                                    gun-stacks; but Longstreet had enough for the present, and was off.</p>
                        <p>The 8th and 9th were spent by us in throwing up intrenchments, &amp;c. Having
                                    moved many miles to the left, we came in sight of the Po river at 5 P.M. Here Lieut.
                                    Gen. Grant and Gen. Meade passed through the files of our regiment as it lay in an
                                    open field in line of battle. After a sharp skirmish, we crossed the Po at
                                    6$1/2 o'clock, and bivouacked on the farm of one Giles C.
                                    Graves. Chickens, turkies, pigs, <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-034-1-095"/> and the
                                    contents of a smoke-house, ice-house, and corn-crib soon disappeared, although the
                                    rebel sharp-shooters made the vicinity of these out-houses a dangerous place till
                                    dark. Men, though, after a few days' constant fighting, care but little for
                                    life, and really don't mind the fire of sharp-shooters or skirmishers but
                                    little more than people at home do house flies.</p>
                        <p>On the morning of the 10th our batteries opened all around. We lay for some hours
                                    watching the shells burst—no reply from the "Johnny"
                                    guns for some time; finally, however, they opened out, and the chimnies and board
                                    fences around Graves' dwelling flew to pieces in grand style. Soon after
                                    our brigade was put in motion, re-crossed the Po, and moved off to the left to
                                    support a charge of the 5th corps. We formed for the charge in five lines. Remember
                                    there are <hi rend="i">ten "skeleton"</hi> regiments in our
                                    brigade now. Whilst closed thus in mass, awaiting the bugle call to advance, the
                                    "Johnnies" made the solid shot and shrapnel whistle around
                                    us—pieces of railroad iron were also thrown, making a—well, a
                                    hell of a noise expresses it fully. One of these "chunks" of
                                    "pig" cut down a tall pine near by, two feet in diameter.</p>
                        <p>At half-past two the bugle sounded the advance. We were in the second line of the
                                    brigade line of battle. Soon after entering a thicket our line halted, and the front
                                    line halted and the front line of battle engaged the enemy fifty yards in front of
                                    us. One of the "Johnny" messengers having brought the
                                    "claret" [blood] from your correspondent, he passed through the
                                    line and reported to the Colonel. "Take my horse, Will [urged a friend,]
                                    and ride him out—I cannot get along with him in this
                                    underbrush." These were the last words I ever heard the "bravest
                                    of the brave" speak. I mourn his loss, for he was my friend, and a lion in
                                    the day and hour of battle. Peace to his soul!</p>
                        <p>The night following was spent amongst the groans and cries of the wounded and dying
                                    at the Corps' field-hospital. I had much rather have been on a skirmish or
                                    picket-line than amongst the army butchers.</p>

                                    after being jolted for <hi rend="i">sixteen</hi> hours in coming <hi rend="i">fourteen</hi> miles' Several times the train was stopped to bury some

                        <p>The road to Belle Plain Landing on the Potomac was simply horrible. Before reaching
                                    the Potomac we passed a large hollow, very deep and round like a bowl. In this were
                                    confined 10,000 "Johnnies"—they are the hardest
                                    two-legged things to see in America, by thunder—being: just the color of
                                    the ground or one of their d—–d "Johnny
                                    cakes" of corn meal. Two batteries of bright, brass twelve-pounders, one on
                                    each side of the hole, frowned down on 'em, whilst guards paced the entire
                                    circuit at intervals of about fifteen yards with muskets leaded, capped, and
                                    half-cocked. Reserves were also posted at convenient <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-034-1-096"/> distances—the men lounging around their
                                    gun-stacks ready to "fall in" at the first alarm.</p>

                        <p>Having nothing to do but to keep quiet, grin, and bear it, I will jot down for you a
                                    few more items and incidents of the late battles in the Wilderness.</p>
                        <p>The late battle-field of Chancellorsville was still strewn thickly with fragments of
                                    the strife—portions of cannon, their limbers and caissons broken;
                                    muskets, pieces of uniform, haversacks, canteens, knapsacks, and the bleaching
                                    skeletons of the brave fellows that fought and fell; rifle-pits, and breast-works, a
                                    portion partially demolished, were visible in all directions. Both armies adopted
                                    the McClellan plan—"fortify as you go"—a few
                                    shovels full of earth and a log or two save many lives.</p>
                        <p>Strange feelings crept over me as we marched along the same road and over the same
                                    ground where one year and a day before I had stood up with my comrades in line of
                                    battle. The old white house occupied as headquarters by Gen. Couch during the fight,
                                    shattered and torn with hostile shot and shell, is still standing, a refuge for bats
                                    and owls (ghosts, too, for aught I know).</p>
                        <p>I remember the identical tree on which hung our blood-red hospital flag. A group of
                                    tall, stately pines, near which a lot of beeves were butchered for us first, and a

                                    rifle balls and cannon shot, bear witness to the fierceness of the contest.</p>
                        <p>Beyond the battle-field some five miles, in a southerly direction, we crossed the Ny
                                    river, a mere ditch, not over twelve or fifteen feet in width. On the southern bank
                                    was a smelting furnace (since burned by our troops), and beyond an iron-ore mine,
                                    worked quite recently, as the heaps of freshly-dug ore indicated.</p>
                        <p>At Cobb's Tavern, we saw the first secesh females—quite a squad
                                    of 'em there was, too. Their look was one of bitterness and hatred. Little
                                    care the rough soldiery for this, however—three years service steels a
                                    man's heart to anything.</p>
                        <p>The ground in front of the position so hotly contested for on the 5th and 6th of May
                                    [1864] presented <hi rend="i">all the horrors</hi> of a battlefield, including the
                                    charred and blackened remains of those who were burned and smothered in the blazing
                                    leaves and underbrush; saplings were split into matches by the storm of bullets.
                                    Soldiers of all ranks lay there—a muddy slough filled with spice bushes
                                    was literally corduroyed with the dead bodies of our fellows, whilst on the narrow
                                    ridge directly in front the Johnnies lay piled in heaps. Sharp-shooters commanded
                                    the plank-road, and if a man wanted to be satisfied for once that he was the
                                    identical individual fired at, his curiosity could at once be gratified by leisurely
                                    crossing this highway of Death. Towards the close of the fight Col. Coons gave he
                                    his horse to carry a dispatch to Gen. Webb, and in doing so, I was compelled to
                                    gallop some distance down the plank-road. No use dodging—they flew too
                                    thick! Why I was not killed, can't tell—time hadn't
                                    come I guess. 'Tis astonishing how soon men become accustomed and totally
                                    indifferent to danger. During these successive fights in the Wilderness I have
                                    frequently seen soldiers sitting by the side of a dead comrade eating, whilst others
                                    were loading and firing with all their might in the same line.</p>
                        <p>An ice-house was captured on the 7th by our skirmishers from the Johnny pickets, and
                                    was the "bone of contention" all day, our men holding it, however.
                                    'Twas amusing and exciting to see our fellows (those not engaged) crawling
                                    down to the skirmish line after their "rations of ice," and coming
                                    back on a "double-quick" when the ration had been served. All of
                                    these adventurers did not escape unscathed.</p>
                        <p>A regiment of Chippewa Indians were sent out on the 9th to sharp-shoot. The yell they
                                    raised on getting in range of the Johnnies scared nobody, but on the contrary was so
                                    original that men on both sides laughed heartily. These "allies"
                                    were, I presume, denied the privilege of scalping a fallen foe, as I saw none of
                                    those "reeking trophies" in their belts on their return.</p>
                        <p>I noticed that the Heights of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Fredericksburg</settlement>
                                    </placeName> were not fortified in the rear. The train of ambulances coming in well
                                    up the river and winding down in front of all the rifle-pits and earth-works, I had
                                    the gratification of thoroughly inspecting this rebel stronghold—this
                                    time at "short range," and without being shot at! I always said
                                    (and shall <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-034-1-098"/> stick to it), that this position was
                                    and is impregnable, when held by veterans, to an attack in front.</p>
                        <p>The fields in the immediate vicinity of the town were planted with corn principally,
                                    which was just sprouting—soon to be trampled into mire by the thousands
                                    of horses and mules attached to this army.</p>
                        <p>Had the Johnny bullet-hole been in my arm instead of my foot, I should have tried to
                                    visit some places of interest (to me) in this town—the house Co.
                                    "G" was quartered in both before and after the fight in Dec.
                                    '62—the depot where the huge 20-pound shells first bursted in
                                    our ranks, and the ditch into which our poor fellows, killed in this
                                    "Burnside's slaughter-pen," were thrown.</p>
                        <p>The country north of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Fredericksburg</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, all the way to the Potomac, is a barren waste—now and then
                                    a house filled with women and children, who wear a care-worn frightened look that
                                    arouses one's sympathies at once. How they have subsisted the past winter,
                                    God only knows! I saw perhaps half a dozen little patches (for roasting ears,
                                    probably) a few peas, beans, onions, &amp;c.—no fences, though, not a
                                    sign of an enclosure was there. A hard, hard lot is theirs! These are probably the
                                    families of the devilish guerrillas that scour this desolate waste as Arabs do the
                                    Desert, but nevertheless the helpless women and children are to be pitied.</p>
                        <p>I never saw our men so determined—so confident as they were and are during
                                    this campaign. All seemed to be firmly convinced from the time we crossed the
                                    Rapidan that this was to be the final struggle between the Army of the Potomac and
                                    the Army of Northern Va.; that Lieut. Gen. U. S. Grant was too much for Lee, and
                                    therefore one and all were confident of success; that they will be successful I have

                                    have a year or more to serve Uncle Samuel, that formerly belonged to the 14th
                                    Indiana, and are now attached to the 20th Indiana, are to be divided into two
                                    companies on the reorganization of that regiment, so as to give the non-commissioned
                                    officers of the 14th, who reenlisted last winter, a chance. This is a simple act of
                                    justice to brave men. Well, the boys know that justice and a fair show for all
                                    honors to those deserving them will be meeted out by Col. Taylor of the 20th. My
                                    informant says "our fellows are highly pleased with their new Colonel, and
                                    are quite at home with the men of the gallant double X Indiana regiment." I
                                    am glad of it. There are many clever souls and brave and daring soldiers in that
                                    "remnant" of the 14th, and I shall always take an interest in the
                                    welfare of my old comrades.</p>

                                    with all the comforts and attentions they and theirs could bestow on a wounded
                                    friend. These good people know not how deeply their generous offers stirred the

                        <p>There are three classes of visitors to the hospitals. First, and least important, are
                                    the <hi rend="i">wordy</hi> sympathizers—of both sexes—the
                                    male portion of these "drones" are generally composed of
                                    broken-down, short-winded, long-faced, seedy preachers of all denominations. They
                                    walk solemnly up and down the wards, between the couches of patient sufferers; first
                                    casting their cadaverous looks and ghostly shadow upon all, and then, after a <hi rend="i">whispered</hi> consultation with the surgeon of the ward, offer to
                                    pray; do so, and retire, without having <hi rend="i">smiled</hi> on a single soldier
                                    or dropped a word of comfort or cheer. The females belonging to this (the
                                    "first class") go gawking through the wards, peeping into every
                                    curtained couch, seldom exchanging a word with the occupant, but (as they invariably
                                    "hunt in couples") giving vent to their pent up
                                    "pheelinks" in heart-rending (?) outbursts
                                    of—"Oh, my Savior!" "Phoebe, do look
                                    here!" "Only see what a horrid wound!"
                                    "Goodness, gracious, how terrible war is!" "My! my!!
                                    my!!! Oh, let's go—I can't stand it any
                                    longer!" And as they near the door, perhaps these dear creatures will wind
                                    up with an audible—"Heavens! what a smell! Worse than fried
                                    onions!"</p>
                        <p>Class No. two is composed chiefly of flash youths, got up in the latest style, and
                                    "perfectly regardless of expense," every "har"
                                    in its proper place, kids, canes, and patent leathers, seal rings, and an odor of
                                    musk. Accompanying these are wasp-waisted, almond-eyed, cherry-lipped,
                                    finely-powdered damsels, carrying tiny baskets, containing an exquisitely
                                    embroidered handkerchief, highly perfumed, and a vial or two of restoratives (to be
                                    used in case of sudden indisposition). This batch of "sight
                                    seers," do-nothings, idlers, time-killers, fops, and butterflies skip
                                    through the hospital, and like summer shadows, leave no trace behind.</p>
                        <p>But the members of the third class (and thank fortune, their name is legion) with
                                    their cheerful and benevolent countenances, words of sympathy and encouragement;
                                    their ever ready smile and helping hand to fan the fevered brow or carry a cup of
                                    cooling beverage to parched lips; their quiet step, plain and unassuming manners;
                                    their earnest enquiries and endeavors to find out whether the soldier may not need
                                    something—anything that money can purchase or kindness bestow; their
                                    thousand and one most welcome gifts, from a fresh and fragrant rose to
                                    a—well, I hardly know what not; for the catalogue of presents from these
                                    good Samaritans is as endless as their generosity <pb n="97" id="VAA4025-034-1-101"/> is unbounded. Their whole souls are in the good work, and many an eye glistens
                                    with a bright tear-bead to hear their kind words, and in returning thanks for these
                                    (to the soldier) priceless treasures. These noble souls totally obliterate all signs
                                    or thoughts of the two former classes of visitors—the "sight
                                    seers" and "ah, me's!"</p>
                        <p>Now, all soldiers are not alike any more than other people, to-be-sure, and while one
                                    will eagerly accept a gift from strange hands, another by his side would quietly but
                                    most respectfully refuse, with the remark—"bestow your gifts, my
                                    kind sir, on some one more in need of luxuries or necessaries;" but each
                                    and every gallant fellow feels his heart beat with joy as these articles are
                                    distributed, and the donors do not experience more real pleasure in bestowing than
                                    the blue jackets in receiving, and the hearty "God bless you" of
                                    many a mangled and suffering volunteer no doubt re-pays them ten thousand times

                        <p>The odor from the "dead-house" when it is first opened for
                                    ventilation each day, is most offensive. This institution is entirely too near the
                                    hospital. The military command, a first Lieutenant of the Second Battallion, Invalid
                                    Corps, is a thorough going soldier (minus his right arm), keeps the yard and grounds
                                    thoroughly policed and his men as clean and neat as soap, blacking and pipe clay can
                                    make a soldier, his clothing, and arms. In fact, the boys spend two-thirds of their
                                    time, when off duty, polishing up.</p>

                    </placeName>, 1937. Pp. xiii, 293, illustrated, $5.00.</head>
            <p>One is seldom privileged to review a publication which combines so many outstanding innovations. This
                        <hi rend="i">de luxe</hi> volume will serve as a lasting memento to the author; bring
                    superlative commendations to the Indiana Historical Society; and establish a unique standard for
                    archeological publications. It will give to the present generation in the Hoosier State a review of
                    past archeological records, and enable everyone to grasp the full significance of the prehistoric
                    heritage in the state.</p>
            <p>The author has very modestly set forth in the Preface the real purpose of this book: "The
                    object in writing … was to interest more of the people of Indiana in the relics of our
                    vanished predecessors, and to stimulate inquiry into the prehistory and archaeology of our state.
                    The pursuit of this subject has led the author along such pleasant paths that he is desirous of
                    sharing them with others." The reviewer was privileged to participate in the fascinating
                    work of recovering a very small part of the prehistory of Indiana. He feels it a duty, therefore, to
                    point out that the science of anthropology, especially archeology, has grown by leaps and bounds not
                    only in Indiana, but in the entire northern <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> because of Mr.
                    Lilly's enthusiastic response to the problems confronting scientists in this region.</p>
            <p>Indiana has now passed the initial step of outlining the important prehistoric problems within the
                    state and we can look forward to the fruitful phase which will follow under the expert guidance of
                    the archaeological staff. Much is yet to be accomplished, but with the highest hurdle cleared and
                    inches to spare, the remaining problems will be taken in a natural stride.</p>
            <p>There are two methods now being followed by the professional archaeogolist in obtaining a true
                    picture of the prehistory of a state. One method is to sample as many of the outstanding sites as
                    possible in order to obtain an outline or "bird's-eye view" of the
                    prehistoric picture. Another method is to survey systematically the state by county units or stream
                    valleys, making sufficient excavations to obtain a cross section <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-034-1-104"/> within these units of the aboriginal material cultures. The latter requires planned research,
                    often unlimited patience on the part of the investigator and sponsor, but in the end will give the
                    most accurate history of the first inhabitants. It is a pleasure to report that Indiana has
                    willingly responded to the latter approach. <hi rend="i">Prehistoric Antiquities of Indiana</hi>
                    presents in a form unsurpassed a compilation based on the work of various investigators whose
                    programs of research have been based on systematically surveying the more important river valleys,
                    using the county as a unit. This may serve as a model for other state organizations, especially when
                    the dry initial reports are so entertainingly summarized.</p>
            <p>Members of the Indiana Historical Society will cherish the volume even though they have no interest
                    in the recreation of prehistory. This quarto volume is beautifully printed by The Lakeside Press on
                    Ivory Wove Linweave text paper with 14 pt. Baskerville type. It contains eighty-eight pages of
                    illustrations produced by the Donnelley Deeptone process, a recent development of deep-etched
                    lithography. The end papers carry a panoramic view of The Great Circle at Mounds Park, now well
                    protected as a state park near Anderson, Indiana. The illustrations have been faithfully reproduced
                    from prints made by an expert photographer. The artistic arrangement of the specimens is quite
                    unusual, especially for archeological reports. The mounting on such backgrounds as white sand, bear
                    robes, tree sections, old survey maps of archeological sites are quite effective. But the
                    arrangement of discoidals on an illustration of a carved shell gorget depicting the use of
                    discoidals and carved stone tobacco pipes mounted on a pressed specimen of <hi rend="i">Nicotiana
                        attenuata</hi> produces very pleasant, attractive, and novel illustrations when compared to the
                    more usual black and white reproductions. The chapter initials very appropriately show design
                    elements from carved bones recovered in some of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                        <settlement type="city">Hopewell</settlement>
                    </placeName> mounds. All of this is handsomely bound between green and brown buckram cloth boards,
                    with gold-stamped front cover and backbone. One must see the book to appreciate it fully.</p>
            <p>The story told by <hi rend="i">Prehistoric Antiquities of Indiana</hi> is just as entertainingly
                    written as the format suggests. It combines modern viewpoints derived from the sound theories <pb n="101" id="VAA4025-034-1-105"/> upon which they are based. Any difference of opinion that might
                    exist between the author and other specialists in the field is of such a nature that even the
                    professionals are divided as to the correct solution. Mr. Lilly touches upon controversial subjects
                    and sublimates the theories of all in noteworthy style. The abundant use of footnotes not only
                    clarifies details, but credits everyone who has contributed anything to the archaeology of the
                    state.</p>
            <p>The first three chapters have the following headings:</p>
            <p>"The Original Antiquity of the American Indian"</p>
            <p>"A Tentative Outline of the Prehistory of Indiana"</p>
            <p>(To the reviewer this is the most important chapter and should be read not only by the archeologist,
                    but by everyone interested in the history of this state. The outline is one of the most clear cut
                    and up-to-date presentations of these problems.)</p>
            <p>"Some striking Prehistoric Sites in Indiana"</p>
            <p>(Herein is reviewed all previous research. It can serve as an excellent guide for the expansion of
                    state parks and recreation areas which would preserve these remnants of a prehistoric civilization.)</p>
            <p>The remaining seven chapters deal primarily with descriptions, classifications and illustrations of
                    the various types of artifacts from the entire state.</p>
            <p>Another important contribution and a subject which first brought Mr. Lilly to the attention of
                    archeologists is an archaeological biblography of Indiana, which he began many years ago and
                    published in May, 1932. The bibliography included in this volume is revised and considerably
                    enlarged. All publications, after the more general ones, have been alphabetically arranged according
                    to author and the counties within the state.</p>
            <p>In closing, the reviewer wishes to offer his sincere congratulations to Mr. Lilly for establishing
                    this high standard for archaeological publications and to express complete satisfaction in the
                    methods used by him to place the study of Indiana archaeology before the public and scholars in such
                    a handsome form.</p>

                    Emanuel Hertz. The Viking Press, <placeName>

            <p>Mr. Hertz is an able and honest student of Lincoln and Herndon. He has prepared a very valuable
                    volume, not the least important part of which is his "Introduction" of twenty-four
                    pages. This, in itself, is a real contribution to Lincoln historiography. Of the letters and other
                    documents compiled and published in this collection, the editor says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Here at last is Herndon's complete evidence, the full record of the steps by which
                            he reached his conclusions, the supporting testimony of his and Lincoln's
                            contemporaries. The principals of the story are no longer alive, and no excuse remains for
                            silence. These seventy years have made meaningless the passions which were responsible for
                            the misunderstanding of Herndon and his motives. Now we who love the memory of Lincoln may
                            probably thank the fate which gave us William Herndon's unflagging passion for
                            completeness. …</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>There are two hundred thirty-nine pages of "Letters from Herndon", that bear dates
                    from January 8, 1866, to February 27, 1891. Under "Evidences" the compiler
                    presents seventy-four pages of "Letters to Herndon", fifty pages of
                    "Statements Collected by Herndon", and fifty pages of "Herndon's
                    Notes and Monographs". Quite a number of the students of Lincoln have gone through some of
                    the original copies of these documents and a few have had access to many of them, but their
                    publication opens them to all.</p>
            <p>A reading of Herndon's papers convinces one that he knew many things about Lincoln from
                    close association and that he gathered much additional information from others that might otherwise
                    have been lost. No careful biographer of Lincoln has neglected Herndon in the past, and certainly
                    none will fail to use the Herndon material in the future. Researchers gleaning information from the
                    letters and other writings of Herndon will accept facts which he had a chance to know or facts
                    gathered from others who were in a position to know them. They will, of course, accept some
                    statements that purport to be true with caution, weighing the reliability of the evidence as they
                    would from any other source.</p>
            <p>It is very apparent that Herndon persistently theorized about what he knew and what, he learned
                    concerning Lincoln. Some of his theories he repeated over and over. He had a large amount of
                    personal experience and information as a basis for his theories and conclusions, but they
                    nevertheless <pb n="103" id="VAA4025-034-1-107"/> remain the theories and conclusions of a man who
                    was far from infallible. The only safe way for one who searches through the Herndon material is to
                    distinguish carefully between fact and opinion since these are well mixed together in almost every
                    paragraph. After sifting out the facts and interpreting them for himself, the researcher can
                    undoubtedly profit by checking his own conclusions with those of Herndon.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hertz evidently believes that the publication of the Herndon papers will rehabilitate
                    Lincoln's law partner. Whether this result shall follow or not, a reading of the material
                    will reveal to anyone both the strength and the limitations of Herndon. Mr. Hertz is correct in his
                    belief that the sources which he has compiled will do no "harm to Lincoln's name
                    and fame." It is true that the papers "contain the best yet said as well as the
                    worst of the man Lincoln", and perhaps most students of Lincoln will agree with the belief
                    of Hertz that "an unbiased and accurate Life of Lincoln is now much more nearly
                    possible" than before the appearance of <hi rend="i">The Hidden Lincoln.</hi>

                    show his varied interests. Number 3 of volume one is a pamphlet of forty-nine pages that came from
                    the press in January, 1938. This study, <hi rend="i">Shawnee Stems and the Jacob P. Dunn Miami

            <p>A few times, when I was starting on my second year in high school in the fall of 1886, I watched the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Delphi</settlement>
                    </placeName> Light Guards as they drilled. They met on certain evenings in a large second-story room
                    near the "bank corner." When Captain Louis Niewerth gruffly barked, "Mark
                    time!" the boys in the company stepped in unison but did not advance. This was new to me
                    then, but I have seen a great deal of "marking time" in all walks of life since
                    that year.</p>
            <p>No doubt, I advanced some in the four years just after leaving Indiana University, but the forward
                    movement was on a level plateau. I had a job with a modest stipend attached, though <hi rend="i">modest</hi> may be an exaggeration. There was a college debt to pay. It was not so big, but the
                    amount by which I could whittle it down annually seemed small indeed.</p>
            <p>My only brother,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> seven years younger than myself, after a severe attack of
                    sciatic rheumatism in 1900, was never well again, though he lived until 1922. For the first two
                    years, he could walk some with difficulty, but after that very little and in time not at all. As his
                    mind remained keen and active through all the years of his misfortune, association with him was a
                    rare privilege. His spirit pervaded the lives of all of the members of our family, and he lived on
                    his interest in our activities and those of his friends and acquaintances. Observing his seemingly
                    unbearable handicap, I dared not notice the small things that stood in my own way.</p>
            <p>Unable to advance to a better salaried position for what seemed a long time,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> I
                    made an effort to render superior service in the work that was mine to do. I seemed to be in a blind
                    alley, but, perhaps in several ways, my second period as a high school teacher was as fruitful as
                    any time of equal length. There was not an adequate library at hand in which to do research, but,
                    even had there been one, my class work was so heavy and my other duties so numerous that I suppose

                    like bankers, lawyers, ministers and others, tend to fit into the surroundings and become
                    permanently no bigger than the demands of the situation require them to be.</p>
            <p>In every community, one is in the midst of a social laboratory where plenty of experiments are open
                    for observation to those who have eyes to see. I did not fully sense this, but, while I added
                    something to my knowledge of history each year, I did ponder over the various problems of community
                    living as the days and months went by. One is not likely to be much concerned about the
                    undercurrents of human life as they flow past him unless he has some time for reflection. Even then,
                    unless he has the right turn of mind, he can very soon think himself dry.</p>
            <p>To work several years with high school boys and girls, while living from hand to mouth and performing
                    a never ending round of gratuitous services on the side would not at any time or place appeal very
                    strongly to up-and-coming young men. As one who went through the ordeal, I may be permitted to
                    assert that there are plenty of experiences, commonly regarded as highly desirable, that I think are
                    much worse. Incidentally, I may also interpolate that it is not so easy for me to convince myself
                    that human beings would refuse to struggle for the good of themselves and society if the profit
                    motive were wanting.</p>

            <p>History, contrary to a common idea, is a very difficult subject to teach. Any alert teacher can
                    question his students on the content of a certain number of pages in the text book during each
                    recitation, and grade them on their success in reproducing what they have read or studied. However,

                    possible for his students to relive the past, and this no one can do who merely knows the lesson as
                    presented in the text-book. If the teacher of history can travel along a familiar path through the
                    events and movements of a period or of the history of a country, he can make that path familiar to
                    his students. He must see the end of the pathway at the beginning, the beginning from the end and
                    have a thorough acquaintance with the slopes, the turns and the objects along the way. To acquire
                    this knowledge and understanding of the history of any period or country, one must read and digest
                    what is read and continue reading and digesting indefinitely. A knowledge of past events and
                    movements, will at least throw light on current happenings and problems, and present events can be
                    constantly used to make intelligible the actions of men and peoples of times that are past.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>By 1903 football had become a sport of much importance in Indiana high schools, in fact, it was the
                    only sport of that period that was apt to bring different high schools into contests with each
                    other. There was much interest in football in <placeName>

                            University where he remained until he received the Ph.D. degree. From 1908 until his death
                            in 1937, he was a professor in the School of Education of <placeName>

                            teachers in the high school, Bobbitt was almost always at my side sharing my

                    </placeName>. While a high school instructor, I always had some responsibility for athletic teams. I
                    was never a coach, but served often as manager or treasurer, and every year as a general monitor or
                    adviser.</p>
            <p>The last football season of my high school teaching career was that of 1907. During the fall of that
                    year, I was present during every hour when the team practiced and at every game played at home or
                    away. The coach, Ralph Nusbaun, was a young man who had finished high school two or three years
                    earlier, and who was now a cub reporter for the <placeName>

                    were some fine boys on that football squad and they prided themselves on clean playing. Nine games
                    were played during the season. I copied the schedule in the back of the little book in which I kept
                    my cash amount for that year, with the scores, and will here reproduce the record:</p>

                            </placeName> team did not score until the last three games. Our coach was clearly able to
                            teach defensive tactics, but we needed to develop a better offensive. We had one excellent
                            half-back, stocky and strong and very speedy, whose name was Bedenkop. The other half-back,
                            Howard McCoy, while not so speedy, was alert and always ready to do his part. It seemed to
                            me that we were not using these players to the best advantage. I urged Nusbaum, the young
                            coach, to devise some special plays which he did. One play that helped to improve the
                            offensive power of the team was known among the boys as
                            "11–16," these being the first numbers used when calling
                            signals. It was a double "fake." The punter dropped back as if for a kick,
                            but, on receiving the ball, ran to the right while the right end ran down the field to
                            receive a forward pass. This, of course, drew the back field of the opposing team over to
                            their left. When passing the right half-back the ball was given to him by the full-back (the
                            auarter-back was our punter, who, of course, took the position of full-back), and he ran to
                            the left with the left half-back and left end as interference. We had an excellent line and
                            the trick worked well. It could of course be reversed and the ball carried down the field to
                            the right by the left half-back. I invented the play especially that the speed of Bedenkop,
                            right halfback, might be turned to account. My first idea was simply to have the punter run
                            with the ball, but, when I diagrammed the play, Charles ("Chic") Darling
                            who played right end immediately asked why he could not run down the field as if he were to
                            receive a pass and his suggestion was at once adopted. The play was used with startling
                            effect in the game against <placeName>

                    grounds on November 16. The day was fine and the crowd large. The ground had frozen some on Friday
                    night but by Saturday afternoon the surface of the playing field was slippery because it had become
                    warm enough to thaw during the day. Before the first half ended, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName> made a touchdown and also gained the extra point. The <placeName>

                    field during the intermission. The coach counseled with the squad for perhaps three minutes and then
                    asked me to say something to the boys. I asked them what was the matter, and they told me that the
                    surface of the field was so "slick" that it was impossible to hold back their
                    opponents who were equipped with new shoes that prevented slipping.</p>
            <p>It seemed that our team was like the Persians at Marathon, only it was a difference in the length of
                    shoe-cleats instead of hand weapons. The team was completely discouraged—overcome by the
                    thin coating of wet, slimy soil that covered the gridiron. To start with, I told the boys that they
                    were fighting a good team that expected to win, "but," I added, "you are
                    a better team and you know it, and you must not let yourselves be defeated." Every boy
                    looked at me sad-eyed and ashamed and nearly all of them spoke together—
                    "It's that mud, Mr. Lynch." "Listen to me, boys," I
                    said, speaking slowly and earnestly, "When this game is over and you are defeated no one
                    will pay any attention to what you say about mud. Everyone will look at the score and nothing else.
                    I want every man of you to forget that there is any mud on that field. Go back there and play the
                    game as you know how to play it, and I am sure the story of the second half will be something to be
                    proud of."</p>

                    dining room collected fifty cents from each patron after each meal and every one paid in coin. I
                    don't know how much gold the prospectors averaged per day or month, but it was apparent
                    that the gentleman who fed them was operating a small gold mine.</p>

                    The snows were melting so fast when I was in the Valley that the streams were bank full or
                    overflowing into the lower areas of the fields, low stretches of uncultivated tracts, and into the
                    lower portions of roads. The corn crop was maturing, wheat was being threshed, and the honey
                    producers were holding conferences with agents who were negotiating for the summer's
                    output. Alfalfa is the all important grass crop of the area, and the bees work on the flowers of the

                            printer (O. R. Murnan) employed by the Indiana University Press who drove through the Owens
                            Valley in 1926. I have at no time since 1906, found any one else that ever visited the

                    <pb n="113" id="VAA4025-034-1-117"/> ditches, and they become lined with willows and heavy growths
                    of weeds: Low places in fields get too much water when it is turned on and high places get none,
                    which means that in some otherwise fine fields there are both swamps and pieces of desert. Areas in
                    the valley where irrigation brings mineral matter to the top that is hostile to plants are not worth
                    much. Non-irrigated stretches, sometimes very extensive, are sandy and barren or covered with
                    stunted shrubs—sage-brush, grease-wood and rabbit-bush. Cemeteries are treated with water
                    and covered with alfalfa, otherwise these burial grounds would be mere parts of the desert.</p>
            <p>The common method of irrigating a field, is not to turn the water into a series of furrows, but to
                    open the gate of the ditch running along one side of the field near the corner and let the water
                    slowly spread over the gently sloping surface. The farmer with hoe in hand walks about as the water
                    spreads, and with the least effort possible opens and closes hundreds of tiny dams one after
                    another. These dams are practically invisible and are only little ridges of soil about two inches
                    high. I watched the process and walked about over an alfalfa field from which a crop had recently
                    been harvested with a man who guided the flow of water by using his hoe. His object was to direct
                    the water so that a reasonable amount would soak into every square yard of soil. By closing ditch
                    gates from time to time along the side of the field and opening others, the whole could be treated
                    in a few hours, then left alone for a week, or ten days, or even more, according to the crop.</p>
            <p>I had no difficulty in transacting the business that I had in hand, and found the executor and
                    attorney for my deceased uncle's estate to be men of intelligence and honesty. To confer
                    with the attorney, I had to go to Independence, the county seat, which was forty miles from Bishop.
                    I took the little train on the narrow gauge railroad, going south on Saturday, August 11, and back
                    to Bishop on Sunday. The fare was $2.20 each way, or five and a half cents per mile. At
                    Independence, I found several old men who had known my uncle well. When I stepped on the stage to go
                    back to the railway station on Sunday forenoon, several of these old-timers surrounded me and urged
                    me to come back. One interesting and weatherbeaten product of a half century of hard <pb n="114" id="VAA4025-034-1-118"/> experience, spoke to me very earnestly, saying: "You will be
                    back. Whoever takes a drink of water from Owens River is sure to come here again."</p>
            <p>Several feet from the brick hotel in Independence, a hogshead thickly covered with burlap rested on a
                    small platform about three feet high. The cask was filled with water and persons about the hotel,
                    using a hose, kept the burlap covering well soaked. Being thoroughly exposed to the sun, evaporation
                    went on steadily, especially since the air was quite dry. The drinking water in the hogshead was
                    thus kept refreshingly cold. Indeed the cask with its crude covering was called an "<placeName>

            <p>I left Bishop on August 14, stopping overnight again at Mina. The next day I rode on to Hazen, where
                    I soon left for <placeName>

                    succeeding nights I slept in Pullman berths. Passing over the Sierra <placeName>

                    </placeName> by daylight and arrived at Oakland Pier at 7:00 A.M. I was to start for home at 7 P.M.,
                    so I made the most of my hours in the splendid city which had been visited by a destructive
                    earthquake and a far more destructive fire only three months before.</p>
            <p>The Bay was extremely beautiful on that bright, cold morning as I crossed to the Ferry Building on
                    one of the steamers that plied back and forth from Oakland Pier. After getting breakfast in a busy
                    restaurant, in a new, one-story frame building, one of the temporary structures erected after the
                    fire, I walked entirely across the almost rectangular area of eighty blocks where everything had
                    been destroyed. My interest was active as I went out through the devastated section, but, as I
                    returned to the Ferry Building, I looked neither to the right nor to the left.</p>
            <p>The evidence was unmistakable that the earthquake had played havoc with buildings, sidewalks, and
                    car-tracks in the lower and more level part of the city, and that fire had done the rest. The
                    steel-frame business structures survived the shock, and a vast number of homes in residence
                    districts were not greatly harmed, though most of the chimneys had to be repaired or rebuilt.
                    Enterprising firms had moved to residence streets and were carrying on in dwelling houses. Banners
                        <pb n="115" id="VAA4025-034-1-119"/> floated above the roofs of these homes, each carrying the
                    name of some department store, clothing firm, or other business. There were still, on August 16, ten
                    thousand or more refugees living in tents on vacant tracts along the outskirts of the city.</p>
            <p>I left Oakland late in the evening of August 17, and reached Pueblo early in. the afternoon of the
                    nineteenth. Mrs. Lynch had come from <placeName>

                            figure-eight, roller-coaster, a somewhat dilapidated, rickety looking affair. Before we
                            could guess what was coming or protest, one of the young men had bought six tickets. The

                            nowhere and when the ride was over we had accomplished nothing save to risk our lives. I am

            <p>If it is important that church and state keep careful records of historical facts and incidents, it
                    is vitally more important that the family, the greatest of the three and the foundation of the
                    others, keep careful records. Family Bibles fade and become illegible, fall to pieces, and are lost
                    to posterity. It is a great satisfaction to trace one's forebears back to the time when the
                    land was a trackless wilderness and ascertain to which branch of those early pioneers one belongs,
                    how he is related to the others, and from what type of stock he is descended. Henry Ward Beecher
                    said: "The dry branches of genealogical trees bear many pleasant and curious fruits for
                    those who know how to search after them."</p>
            <p>The surname <hi rend="i">Baumann</hi> (Bowman) is a common one in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName>-speaking countries. There have been several changes in the spelling of the name from
                    medieval times to the present. For instance, <hi rend="i">Buman</hi> was used until 1617; then <hi rend="i">Buwman</hi> and <hi rend="i">Bouwann,</hi> until 1650; and later <hi rend="i">Baumann</hi> or <hi rend="i">Bauman.</hi> This last spelling was changed to <hi rend="i">Bowman</hi> in the case of early American members of the family as English officials, in entering
                    court records of legal documents, spelled the <hi rend="i">Bau</hi> as it sounded—that
                    is, <hi rend="i">Bow. Baughman, Boughman,</hi> and <hi rend="i">Bachman</hi> are less frequent
                    spellings.</p>
            <p>All of the early emigrant Baumanns were Palatines of Swiss-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> origin, coming from the Rhine district. Although there are records in the early
                    eighteenth century of the landing of relatively few members of this family, Wendell, Christian,
                    George, Daniel, and Hans are mentioned. From 1750 on, the name appears frequently. The lives of
                    those mentioned are closely connected; their sources, arrivals, religion, locations, and dealings
                    being closely associated, as records prove.</p>
            <p>In July, 710, about 3,000 Palatines, having migrated to <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>, were sent to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> as bond servants of the crown under Governor Robert Hunter. They settled at Livingston
                    Manor and on the opposite side of the Hudson at Saugerities or Schoharie, a tract voluntarily
                    presented to Queen Anne by Indian sachems for the homeless Palatines. Because of their condition of
                    servitude at the first two places mentioned <pb n="124" id="VAA4025-034-1-128"/> and because of
                    refusal to let them leave, some fifty families fled to Schorie in the fall of 1712 and the rest
                    followed in March, 1713. Hardly established in the several settlements, they again found themselves
                    in trouble with the "Gentleman in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>." Continual conflicts made life a burden in Schorie; and despairing of justice
                    in 1722, a large number accepted offers from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> to settle there.</p>
            <p>About two-thirds of the Schoharie people were not willing to buy land or settle on the Mohawk at the
                    Governor's pleasure, so they started for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. From Schoharie they cut through the forests to the head waters of the Susquehana,
                    working down the river to the mouth of the Swatara and then ascended this river to the mouth of the
                    Tulpehocken, where they settled. This was then the most remote outpost of white colonization in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. During this period many other Palatines sailed directly from Rotterdam and Amsterdam
                    or came on ships touching these ports <hi rend="i">en route</hi> from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and bound for <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>, <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
               </placeName>, or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Some setting out for one destination landed at another after many weary weeks of
                    buffeting.</p>
            <p>Jost (Joist) Hite (Heydt), setting out from Strassburg, the principal town of Alsace in 1710, landed
                    at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> with sixteen families in <hi rend="i">Brigatine Swift</hi> and <hi rend="i">Schooner
                        Friendship,</hi> ships built or purchased by Hite for this journey. They then went to Kingston.
                    In 1716 or 1717 Hite and the families with him settled at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Germantown</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Becoming angry with the Governor of the province, partly because he would not give
                    protection from the Indians, Hite purchased land in 1731 from the <placeName>

                    Christian Bowman entered land in 1731 or 1732. Cutting their road through the forests, they crossed
                    the Potomac near Harper's Ferry and entered the rich and beautiful valley. Hite settled

            <p>Christian Bowman, ancestor of the writer, was a native of the vineyard section of the Rhenish
                    Palatinate. According to word of mouth, he and George Bowman, Hite's son-in-law, and
                    probably Wendell Bowman, were related. So far the parentage of Christian has not been established
                    nor the name of his wife ascertained. Tradition tells us that Christian and George came from York (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>) into the Shenandoah Valley of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> at the same time and perhaps they had been together throughout their travels. Court
                    records show the purchase of land by Christian Bowman in May 1737; probate records show his will in
                    1764 and there are other ferefences to him and his neighbors.</p>
            <p>The Bowman family was Lutheran. In early times it had belonged to the Reformed Church, but lated it
                    accepted both of these religions and the Anabaptist, Mennonite, and primitive Baptist (Dunker) in
                    addition. The older members of this family today are Reformed Presbyterians. The occupation of the
                    Bowmans of earlier times was chiefly farming, but today they may be found as representative citizens
                    in practically every walk of life. We find also that war records contain the names of members of the
                    Christian Bowman family. In the Revolutionary War those of the first generation of Palatine
                    emigrants were listed; in the Civil War we find them in both the northern and the southern
                    armies—the proverbial brother against brother. In the Spanish and World Wars they were
                    represented, some again making the supreme sacrifice.</p>

                    spent the rest of his life as a farmer. Later he purchased other land, and at the time of his death,
                    about Jan., 1764, he possessed much real estate. His wife preceded him in death.</p>

            <p>Our family Bible has a record of the marriage of Ephraim Ross to Annah Welles at Gilead Church,
                    Hebron, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> on April 20, 1786. These persons were my maternal great-grandfather and
                    great-grandmother.</p>
            <p>The Welles family has been traced back to Adam De Welles, Baron, who was born in Lincolnshire, <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, about 1265. He was summoned to Parliament on February 6, 1299, and made a Baron; also
                    he was appointed constable of Rockingham Castle and warden of its forests. He died in 1311.</p>
            <p>As Baron he was allotted the Welles coat of arms, which was a lion rampant, sable with tail forked,
                    and motto <hi rend="i">Semper Paratus,</hi> meaning "Always Prepared." We trace
                    our Welles ancestry from him down to Thomas Welles I, who was born in Dudley, Worcestershire, <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, January 10, 1694. Thomas Welles I, with his father, sailed from <placeName>

                    </placeName> to America in 1712, landing at Saybrook, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>. There he was married on "ye 13th of May, 1716," to Elizabeth
                    Merrill. In 1735 he moved to Gilead Parish, Hebron, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, purchased land, reared a large family, and died on February 4, 1760, aged 66 years.
                    His wife, Elizabeth Welles, passed away at Hebron on December 2, 1770. Thomas and Elizabeth Merrill
                    Welles had seven sons. One, Thomas II (our line), was born in Hebron on August 27, 1723, where he
                    lived the rest of his days. In the old Church of <placeName>

            <p>Thomas Welles, the elder, was Captain of the town's first militia, and Captain John W.
                    Welles, his brother, was one of a committee to divide the parish into school districts (Town Record,
                    60).</p>
            <p>Bateman Welles, our ancestor, was the son of Thomas and Thankful Rowles Welles. He was born in Hebron
                    and was evidently a man of substantial means for the time. He held many offices in the parish. He
                    was married on February 12, 1769, to Annah Carter. There were seven children by this marriage. The
                    first child, Annah Welles, born November 18, 1769, was our ancester.</p>
            <p>The first land entry in the name of Bateman Welles (Vol. 6, p. 272) is a deed to him of twenty and
                    one-half acres from Mercy Post, dated February 8, 1776, and acknowledged before John Ashley, Jun.,
                    Justice of the Peace. He sold this parcel of land on November 4, 1793, to Shipman Welles (his son)
                    for twenty pounds. In 1788 he bought sixty-two acres of Thomas Welles II (Vol. 8, p. 66), and sold
                    this land for two hundred thirty pounds in 1793.</p>
            <p>Annah Welles, my maternal great-grandmother, was married to Ephraim Ross at Gilead Church, Hebron, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, on April 20, 1786; she was at the time not quite twenty years old. By this union there
                    were eleven children. The third child, Russell Ross, was my grandfather. He was born on April 16,

                    Twenty-third Company of Marines, Feb. 25, 1755, and became successively First Lieutenant and Captain
                    of an independent foot-company which, however, was disbanded in 1768, when he was placed on half
                    pay. The family always insisted that he was lost at sea. The tradition was that Ephraim Ross when a
                    boy ran away from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Halifax</settlement>

                    </placeName>. The land was on the Onondaga Indian reservation, and the title was acquired by the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the land on which the Ross family lived. The house, of course, disappeared long ago.</p>
            <p>It may be interesting to tell why the family emigrated to Indiana. Just prior to the war with Great
                    Britain in 1812, Ephraim Ross with the help of his brawny sons took a contract to,build a brick
                    schoolhouse for the commissioners at Onondaga Court House. This family were brick-makers and
                    carpenters. When war was declared, the building was about half done; and Ephraim found that on
                    account of the war, living, labor, and material so greatly advanced in price that if he were to
                    finish the building, it would ruin him financially. He went to the commissioners, explained his
                    predicament, and offered to give them the building half completed if they would release him from the
                    contract. After a lengthy conference, he was told to proceed with the building, and that he should
                    have a fair profit. He mortgaged or sold part of his holdings to pay for material and labor, thus
                    finishing the building, whereupon the commissioners repudiated their verbal promise and held him to
                    the contract. As a consequence, he lost practically everything he had.</p>
            <p>The next four years must have been hard ones. The family was large, six boys and four girls, and some
                    of the children were very young. The third son, John Ross, came to Indiana sometime after 1815 and
                    located at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The family decided to join him, gathered together their few belongings, and went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the late fall of 1818. The entire family with the exception of John Ross and
                    possibly Russell took a keelboat down the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>, and opposite <placeName>

               </placeName>. They did not prosper there, as the soil was
                    "crawfish ground," wet and marshy. The entire family had chills and ague. <placeName>

                    Sally Anne, 1807; Alexander, 1809; Emeline, 1812. It is noticeable that several of the names come
                    from the Welles family—Bateman, Betsy, Russell, Polly Ann and Sally Anne.</p>

                    trades and tradesmen as the first brickmakers of the town. The second Court House was made of brick,
                    and it is a well authenticated fact that in an early day, the Ross Brothers made the brick of the
                    town." Russell, Harry, and James, however, in due time engaged in merchandising. They had a
                    store on the west side of the square where they sold calico at twenty-five cents a yard like their
                    brother merchants.</p>
            <p>Members of the Ross family were Presbyterians and were among the first to become members of the first

                    </placeName>. Ephriam Ross and his son Alexander joined the Presbyterian Church on May 2, 1832. The

                    Alexander Ross; so it appears that some of the Ross family withdrew from the Presbyterian Church and
                    affiliated with the Congregational Church thereafter.</p>

                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, about 1820. At that time Indiana, having recently been admitted to the Union in 1816,
                    had no roads fit for wagon travel. Indian trails used by early emigrants were
                    "blazed" between points of travel through an unbroken wilderness. It is barely
                    possible that the family came up to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Knoxville</settlement>,
                            <region type="state" reg="tnu">tnu</region>
               </placeName>, and embarked from there on flat
                    boats, which were used in those days, for the long journey down the <geogName>Tennessee

                    </placeName>. As horses were scarce and high in price, it is not likely that they could have
                    transported their belongings and given each a mount, so the women rode and the men walked.
                    Father's sister Adeline told me that she recalled having ridden horseback in front of her
                    mother on this trip.</p>
            <p>The Teel family, shortly after arrival, located at Cataract Falls on Mill Creek, a fork of Eel River

                        <region type="county">Owen County</region>
                    </placeName>. John Teel built the first grist-mill in that part of Indiana. In connection with
                    grinding corn and wheat, he added a sawmill, using the same power. The land was being cleared, and
                    lumber was in much demand for building the homes of the settlers, who were arriving rapidly at that
                    time. For many <pb n="133" id="VAA4025-034-1-137"/> years there lay in the bed of the Creek just
                    below the Falls near where the mill was located a small mill-stone, or burr, from the ruins of the
                    mill. It was my intention to have it taken to my home, but the ground was purchased by General Lew
                    Wallace, who took the stone to his home in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, east of where the County Infirmary is now located, and resided there almost her entire
                    lifetime.</p>
            <p>In the eighteen-twenties, Indians, probably Miamis, often came down the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> in canoes, and the squaws sold hazel-nuts, moccasins, and beeded work to the villagers
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Emily Ross had very red hair, which is greatly admired by the squaws. They would stop
                    at the log house, and her mother would let them take the child and place her on a blanket under the
                    trees, so they could admire her hair and clothes. One time they gave her two beaded purses,
                    beautifully made, lined with Bayeta cloth. I have them among my relics. Bayeta cloth was the
                    material used. The scarlet uniforms of the British officers of those days were unraveled by squaws
                    and the thread was rewoven in decorating moccasins and lining beaded bags.</p>
            <p>The children of Henry and Emily Ross Teel were: Anna, Grace, Frank, and William Ross. Anna Teel
                    married Horace G. Burt. There were two children by this marriage, Russell Ross Burt and Arthur Burt.
                    Grace Teel married John A. Tenney of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, on Feb. 1, 1900. Frank Teel married Mary Craig. There were no children. William Ross

                    Mr. William H. Dougherty, who lives in that neighborhood, is now trying to find the grave. He has
                    visited another old cemetery nearby but found no grave marked by the name. He thinks in all

                        <settlement type="city">Hamburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> cemetery as an old church history shows his name as one of the charter members of this
                    church, now located in Sellersburg, Indiana. "The old Christian Church, of brick, was
                    erected in 1838. Among its first members were William Wells, John Bloor, Robert Pruett, John Adams,
                    and a number of the Littells. Absolem Littell was the first preacher." (Quoted from the
