                    "white savage," could equal the iniquity that attached to Hamilton's
                    reputation; indeed, not until recent times have historians managed to restore a semblance of balance

                    and the establishment of independence, both men were minor characters. The conflict in the West
                    gained significance only in hindsight. George Washington won the war east of the mountains,
                    employing an army of conventional design and training, with no more than grudging attention to the
                    unseemly conflict that occupied the frontier regions. The western hostilities were important,

                    about themselves. As the behavior of both Hamilton and Clark testifies, Americans and Englishmen
                    were deeply torn over the problem of the Indian. At the same time that they scorned the native way
                    of life as the savage antithesis of civility, they felt strangely attracted to it. In addition, the
                    Americans came to believe that the alliance between the British and the "merciless Indian
                    savages," to use Jefferson's phrasing from the Declaration of Independence, united
                    the foes of liberty with the enemies of civilization. Thus the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>-Clark conflict touched the deepest strains of American commitment during its
                    revolutionary trial.</p>
            <p>The question of employing the native warriors in the War for Independence arose at the outset of the
                    conflict, but after the emission of much pious rhetoric from both sides most of the Indians joined
                    the crown. At first the Continental Congress seemed inclined to promote Indian neutrality, perhaps
                    on the assumption that the natives were more likely to support the British, but local American
                    commanders had already recruited warriors. Besides, rumor had it that the British ministry had
                    formed a plan to unite the tribes against the rebellion. By 1776, on grounds that their involvement
                    was inevitable, the Congress abandoned attempts to keep the Indians neutral and tried with little
                    success to engage them on the American side. British policy had originally been negative, designed
                    to keep the warriors from joining the Americans, but by 1777 military necessity and the prevalent
                    conviction that the Americans had taken the first steps led to the systematic promotion of Indian
                    attacks on the frontier.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The piety exuded by both sides over the misbehavior of their enemies in allying themselves with the
                    "savage" Indians was more than partisan propaganda. There had been a long history
                    of native participation in the American extensions of European wars, hence much experience of native
                    warfare. There had been time for the development of deep feelings. In the end, no doubt, most
                    Englishmen and Americans would have agreed that since the Indians would be fighting "for
                    somebody… they may better be fighting for us than against <list type="footnotes">

                    royal policy. Unfortunately for the British, and the Americans who suffered as a consequence, the
                    Indians attacked the frontier mainly to defend their way of life rather than to further the
                    interests of King George. They fought, therefore, in their own manner and made it inevitable that
                    Hamilton, who initiated and sustained their efforts for his own purposes, should have been accused
                    of throwing in his lot with the Indians and supporting the continued existence of

                    cache of line drawings of Indians and scenes that obviously struck his imagination. He seemed
                    particularly affected by waterfalls, of which four drawings remain: two of Niagara and one each of
                    the falls of the Passaic and the Falls of Chaudiere on the <placeName>

                    spray and conveying an image of tremendous potency. Along the shore foliage and broken trees in
                    forbidding confusion complete an impression of almost Gothic menace. In one Niagara picture the
                    infinitesimal human figures clash with the sweep and strength of the surrounding scene.
                    Hamilton's landscape art reveals an avid observer who held a certain awe for the force of

                    stolid, others more animated, but all are depicted with strength of character. One has the

                    them concrete and tactile realization. In contrast, the native figures that appear in
                    Hamilton's landscapes are overwhelmed by the settings. The two minute Indian hunters who
                    lounge on the edge of a high, precipitous cliff serve mainly to heighten the sheer force of the
                    scene. Others are no more than minimal shapes, human no doubt, but with no function other than to
                    magnify the power of the natural surroundings. In his view of the falls of the <geogName>Passaic

                    </placeName> attributes to the native figures a violence of their own entirely compatible with the
                    surrounding turmoil. Two Indians (the figures are unclothed and hence seem to be Indian) appear at
                    the base of the falls, one in the pool and the other on shore, in the midst of a violent
                    altercation. Hamilton's caption reads: "Here a Savage jealous of his wife, threw
                    her into the River, and in her attempting to get to shore cut off her arm with his

            <p>Hamilton was plainly ambivalent about the native peoples that he saw and drew in the years before the
                    Revolution. In a face-to-face encounter he found the Indian personality worthy of sensitive and
                    intimate portrayal. The visages that he sketched revealed strong and vital personalities, curiously
                    accoutered but with a hint of usual human virtues and foibles. In another setting, however,
                    surrounded by the tumult and splendor of the American wilderness, their personalities seemed utterly
                    overwhelmed by the savage confusion of the background, though in one vivid instance he showed them
                    behaving in a manner befitting the brutal ferment of the world they inhabited.</p>

                    number of detailed and reasonably objective disquisitions on aspects of native life. In addition, he
                    apparently established a close relationship with at least one Indian, a young <placeName>

            <p>Hamilton's real interests in the Indians extended beyond the academic. At first Whitehall
                    had instructed him to keep the warriors out of the American orbit; later he was told to promote and
                    support their attacks on the frontier. To further these policies <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> became a skillful Indian negotiator. Whether his success can be attributed more to the
                    convergence of interest between the British and the northwestern tribes than to his ability as a
                    manipulator of the tribal leadership can only be guessed. It is clear, however, that he brought to
                    his dealings with the Indians the considerable knowledge that he had acquired of native culture and
                    a real though grudging sympathy. He showed none of the disdain and aloofness that hampered much
                    British diplomacy with the American tribes. Soon after <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> went beyond these time-honored methods of gaining native allegiance. He took a lesson
                    from the French experience and resolved to prove to the warriors that the English understood their
                    ways and would do the Indians the honor of participating in them. On no less than a half dozen
                    occasions <placeName>

                    </placeName> and his officers joined in the native war dance and intoned the appropriate song.
                    Perhaps the most publicized of these events occurred in the summer of 1777 when the
                    lieutenant-governor put into effect his orders to unleash the Indians against the frontier. With the
                    warriors arrayed in two lines, an ox was beheaded and a tomahawk sunk into its skull, after which <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> danced and sang the war song. The animal represented the Viriginans against whom the
                    Indians were about to fight. (In a later instance a bear played the symbolic role, and Hamilton
                    himself wielded the tomahawk.) According to the account given by John Montour to Zeisberger,
                    Hamilton was painted and dressed like an Indian for the occasion. Montour's information may
                    have been designed for the expectations of his listener, but there can be no doubt that <placeName>

                    </placeName> had been willing to accommodate himself to the ceremonial "savagery"

            <p>The case against the lieutenant-governor rested precisely on the easy alliance that he had

            <p>Nevertheless, Hamilton did often find the duty of encouraging Indian raids on American settlements
                    unpleasant. In time, of course, after his capture and in response to the obloquy heaped on his name
                    by the Americans, he made a point of stressing the great scruples with which he engaged in frontier
                    war, but one does not have to appeal to these later exculpations. The letters he wrote at the time
                    and the instructions he delivered to visiting tribesmen bear witness to his concern over the nature
                    of Indian hostilities. Despite the allure of the Indians, he shared the widely entertained
                    conviction that the warfare practiced by the warriors constituted a vestige of savagery from which
                    civilization had long since rescued the white man.</p>
            <p>From his experience in the Seven Years' War Hamilton had learned how
                    "deplorable" Indian fighting could be.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> The British,
                    especially, remembered the debacle after the capture of Fort William Henry. When Hamilton fell into
                    French hands at the battle of Sainte Foy in April, 1760, he asked to be taken to the officer in
                    charge. That gentleman, perceiving the danger, exchanged coats with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> so that the scarlet trim on his British uniform would not be seen by the Indians.
                    "Shortly after this," <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> later recorded, "we prisoners were marched ostentatiously thro the Indian
                    encampment, not without a very unpleasant feeling, the Savages employed some in scraping and

                    </placeName> knew that the Indians had already scalped many of his colleagues who had been wounded.
                    He also suspected that not all French officers could be depended upon to protect British prisoners.
                    Rumor had it that the French turned over many prisoners to their "savage" allies
                    who then tortured and killed them.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although Hamilton later tried to moderate the brutality of Indian behavior, he sensed that the task
                    was hopeless. Thus on the eve of dispatching the warriors he pleaded rhetorically, "Would
                    to God this storm which is ready to fall on the Frontiers could be directed upon the guilty heads of
                    those wretches who have raised it, and pass by the miserable many who must feel its fatal

                    never doubted that their lives were both squalid and savage. Although he abhorred the native habit

                    others 15 and 9.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> At the least Hamilton's public reception of scalps
                    meant that he had agreed to engage in the game of wilderness war on the Indians' terms, but
                    his complicity went even deeper. By his own admission he behaved in such a way as to sanction the
                    use of scalps as a valuable instrument in cementing the relationship between the British and their
                    Indian allies. Perhaps the most incriminating evidence may be found in his account of a council held
                    with the Indians at <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> had become more than a detached and reluctant agent of British imperial interests
                    forced by circumstances to deal with allies who had odious manners. On the contrary, his actions
                    lent to the Indian practice a legitimacy that contrasted sharply with his frequent protestations of
                    innocence.</p>
            <p>Hamilton's principal antagonist in the West, George Rogers Clark, faced a different sort of
                    problem in his dealings with the native people. Unless he managed to take <placeName>

                    </placeName> and sweep the British from the Northwest, Clark stood little chance of gaining the
                    Indians' loyalty; thus, his attitudes toward them diverged in many ways from
                    Hamilton's. For him the natives were not potential allies but implacable enemies who
                    tormented his brethren in the frontier settlements. In addition, Clark was free of that
                    eighteenth-century scientific attraction to the natives that informed Hamilton's thinking
                    about them. <list type="footnotes">

                    musings of Clark's mentor, Jefferson, and in the later career of his younger brother,
                    William.) Clark was far more the coarsegrained frontiersman, intelligent but ill-educated,
                    extraordinarily resourceful but ultimately dependent on drink, an Indian fighter who despised his
                    enemy but who often imitated native ways. In this last sense the contrast with <placeName>

                    </placeName> breaks down. For Clark, the Indian could not have been an intellectual issue;
                    nevertheless, he struggled, as did so many in the border settlements, with the lure of native
                    habits. All the more ironic, then, that he should have seen in Hamilton's relations with

                    most Virginians had yet reached, or it may be that his geopolitical foresight was more refined than
                    seems likely and that he understood the importance to peace negotiations of an outpost on the <placeName>

                    And Jefferson, if not Clark, perceived the importance of holding a portion of the great river.
                    Clark, if his own writings are to be believed, thought mainly about Indians. He was a man of the
                    frontier, and he became famous defending it against its "savage" enemies.</p>
            <p>By 1777, when Clark formulated his plan to subdue the northwest Indians, the issue of native
                    participation had been settled. Most of the tribes had already come in on the British side or were
                    likely to do so soon. Hence the American reaction could be expected. The native people had chosen
                    the wrong side in a struggle that for the Americans was certain to determine the future of mankind.
                    People like Henry and Jefferson, the two Viriginia governors with whom Clark dealt, counseled the
                    severest treatment of the tribes who opposed American interests. They could only be a treacherous
                    and dangerous people. They "must be managed," wrote Henry, "by working on
                    their Fears," a sentiment echoed by Jefferson to the effect that if the Indians could not
                    be taught to keep faith, they must be taught to fear. Later in the conflict Jefferson recommended to
                    Clark the "total suppression of Savage Insolence and Cruelties," by which he no
                    doubt meant the "extermination" or removal of tribes who persisted in
                        resistance.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Clark's own formula for treating with Indians fully conformed to the governors'
                    sentiments. He proposed to discard the notion "that soft speeches was best for
                    Indians." It had, he thought, caused untold mischief. He preferred what he called the
                    French and Spanish method, harsh speech and the threat of immediate action. Elaborate festivities
                    with much ceremonial talk and expensive gifts (more the French and Spanish than <list type="footnotes">

                    Indians' minds and led to greater demands and ultimately to another outbreak of conflict.
                    Blunt language and speedy retribution would keep the peace. He told one native group that if they
                    continued to support the British "they would see their great father as they called him
                    given to the Dogs to eat." The Indians, he believed, must be convinced that "we
                    are always able to crush them at pleasure, and determined to do it when Ever they
                    misbehave." So long as the Indians believed that he could make good on his threats (he
                    never really had the force), the method worked. But not always. Old Tobacco, a Piankashaw chief,
                    reacted boldly. Clark was in the habit of offering the Indians two belts simultaneously, one
                    signifiying war and the other peace. They were to make their choice and abide the consequences. For
                    Old Tobacco this procedure defied ancient custom. One could not at a conference "present
                    good and evil at one and the same time." "He kicked the belts from him."
                    Old Tobacco, at least, understood that Clark's bravado anticipated an end to the time when
                    the white man would concede the legitimacy of Indian usages.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It should be noted that Clark's practice did not always conform to his principles. He did,
                    for example, adopt the traditional manner of speaking to Indians, which demanded a heavily allusive
                    mode of speech and the kind of simple vocabulary thought to be suitable for primitive people. In
                    conference with Black Bird, a Chippewa chief, Clark delivered his usual account of the establishment
                    of English settlements in America and the reasons for the Revolution. Black Bird, in turn,
                    "assumed the Airs of a Polite Gen<hi rend="sup">n</hi>… and attempted to speak
                    as much in the European manner as possible." Thus the discussion occupied the better part
                    of the day with Clark doing his best to avoid the "Similes"<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
                    he used with other Indians. Black Bird, it appears, accepted the new dispensation that Clark
                    attempted to introduce into Indian-white relations. Most other Indians did not, in which case Clark
                    adopted the traditional forms of speech that white men assumed were compatible with the Indian
                    manner.</p>

            <p>The truth of the matter was that Clark made a conscious effort at imitating the Indians. It was not
                    merely that he led frontiersmen whom a contemporary observer described as "a wild,
                    ungovernable race, little less savage than their tawny neighbours," men who in fact engaged
                    in "similar barbarities." Clark cultivated the image. He argued that the only way
                    to fight Indians was "to excell them in barbarity." The French inhabitants of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>
                    </placeName> had gotten the message. They were convinced that Clark and his followers "ment
                    to strip the women and children or take the Bread out of ther mouths or… make war on the
                    women and Children or the Church." Clark finally reassured them but not before recording
                    his pleasure that the French should entertain "a most horrid Idea of the Barbarity of the
                    Rebels," that they should believe them "more savage than their Neighbours the
                        Indians."<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

            <p>Clark and his men followed the frontier habit of dressing in a partial imitation of the Indians.
                    Governor Fernando de Leyba of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> described their entrance into town. "The commanding colonel
                    arrived… in a hunting shirt and breechcloth, naked of foot and limb and with his bed,
                    food, and gun on his shoulder. The troops had no other equipment than breechcloth, powder horn, gun,
                    and knapsack." They were, as Leyba noted, "bandits in appearance." The
                    reason was clear. When Clark and his little army reached the falls of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1778, they abandoned their baggage "except as much as would equip us in the
                    Indean [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] mode." In 1780 on his trip east to lead an attack against
                    the Shawnees, Clark and his men disguised themselves as Indians in order to make their way safely
                    through the wilderness; and, of course, most of the men who followed him into <placeName>

            <p>Clark's penchant for ersatz Indianness served him well in surviving the arduous expedition

            <p>Later, the frontiersmen's imitation of the Indians proved to be a minor embarrassment. After

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, Clark established himself at Fort Jefferson on the falls of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and waited for the march against <placeName>

                    </placeName>. It never came. Confined to their stockade with short supplies, the garrison became
                    restless. In the summer of 1782 the French inhabitants of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> found some of their horses missing and assumed that Clark's men from the falls
                    were responsible. A party of Indians was sent in pursuit. They came on the culprits after trailing
                    them for three days, retook the horses, and killed one thief. As one of Clark's
                    correspondents from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> reported: "They knew them to be white people, though disguis'd, and
                    painted as the barbarians, he that was kill'd was undoubtedly a white man and
                    painted." The party had been actually a mixed group of whites and Indians, the whites,
                    performing the native role of horse stealing, appropriately dressed and decorated as Indians.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For white men the quintessential native trait was scalping. They feared and abhorred it as a sign of
                    savagery and regularly engaged in it when they fought the Indians. Whether Clark himself ever raised
                    a scalp cannot be said with assurance. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> thought he had, though in the instance he cited he was probably wrong.) Clark surely
                    had, however, traveled with men who made scalping a common practice, and the soldiers under his
                    command did the same. It was said during Pontiac's Uprising that David Owens, with whom
                    Clark descended the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

            </p>
            <p>Perhaps the most revealing and controversial incident in Clark's career occurred at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> the day before <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> surrendered the fort. Clark was about to meet <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> for a second time to discuss the capitulation when news arrived that a party of
                    Indians, dispatched by Hamilton some weeks before to cut communications on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, was making its way toward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Without knowledge of the situation, the Indians and their white leaders approached the
                    town in the usual mood of celebration, emptying their muskets in the air. The contingent Clark sent
                    to intercept them gained the surprise. Two of the party were killed on the spot (and scalped), and
                    six were taken prisoner. Two of these were Frenchmen who, after being vouched for by a townswoman
                    and one of Clark's French followers, were released. That left four Indians held captive.
                    They were manhandled to the plaza before the fort gate, forced to sit in a circle, and tomahawked.
                    The bodies were scalped, then dragged to the river and thrown in, though some of the victims may
                    still have been alive. The deed done, Clark went to meet <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the esplanade where they continued negotiations.</p>
            <p>Clark offered various accounts of the incident, all of them quite matter-of-fact. He seemed to
                    consider the atrocity fully warranted; certainly he expressed no regret over it. As justification he
                    argued that it had been necessary to show the native warriors who remained in the town that they
                    could no longer depend on the British for support. It is more likely that instead of tactical
                    necessity his motivations drew on a deep well of resentment and passion. He had already informed <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> that he only sought an excuse to put all the Indians and, as he called their white
                    leaders, partisans to death. Moreover, at the sight of one of these captured partisans, painted and
                    regaled like an Indian, he was filled with "indignation" and ordered that he
                    should be executed. By his own admission he was even more violent in his anger at the whites, who
                    had betrayed their obligations to civil behavior, than he was at the Indians, who were, after all,
                    in his mind savages. He ordered the murders as <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Told in its bare detail the incident was sufficiently macabre, but embellished by Clark's
                    British enemies it became even more sanguinary. Both Hamilton and his aide, Lieutenant Jacob
                    Schieffelin, believed that Clark had himself wielded the tomahawk. According to the lieutenant,
                    Clark "took a tomahawk, and in cold blood knocked their brains out, dipping his hands in
                    their blood, rubbing it several times on his cheeks, yelping as a Savage…." One
                    of the Indians, having been struck in the head once without decisive effect, dislodged the tomahawk
                    himself and handed it to his assailant, who delivered two more blows before the warrior was cast
                    into the river apparently still alive. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> described Clark's arrival at the esplanade minutes after, "reeking
                    with blood," where "He spoke with rapture of his late achievement, while he washed
                    of [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] the blood from his hands stain'd in this inhuman
                    sacrifice." The scalps were later displayed outside Hamilton's quarters. Neither
                    Hamilton nor Schieffelin witnessed the incident. Hamilton's information came from the owner
                    of the house where he was held after the surrender who claimed to have been present. Of course the
                    British officers had reason to put Clark in a bad light. Both were under attack for their alleged
                    responsibility for similar "savage" behavior and might profit from making a case
                    against Clark. More important was the ease with which both sides resorted to accusations of
                        savagery.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second atrocity of the day concerned the treatment of Francis Maisonville, one of the leaders of
                    Hamilton's French militia. Maisonville had been away with a scouting party and had returned
                    after Clark and his men had entered the town. According to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, one of the townsmen betrayed him to the Americans. He was threatened with hanging, a
                    halter placed about his neck, if he did not reveal the location of his companions. This method
                    having failed, Clark ordered him scalped in retaliation for his partisan activities. With some
                    reluctance (Clark had to repeat the order) one of the Americans raised two small portions of skin
                    from his head before abandoning the effort. In Schieffelin's account Maisonville lost his
                    whole scalp. Once again one of Clark's French followers interceded, <list type="footnotes">

                    Clark told a different story. Two of his "lads," he wrote, captured Maisonville,
                    "a famous Indian partisan," tied him to a post before the stockade and kept up a
                    fire from behind him. An officer cut short their "amusement" and ordered
                    Maisonville taken to the guardhouse. On the way, Clark admitted, "they were so inhuman as
                    to take part of his scalp." Later, after being sent to <placeName>

                    perhaps a touch of irony, and apparently without misgivings over the retribution due a white man who
                    fought alongside Indians.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> remained the arch-criminal. Though Clark had probably not invented the phrase, his
                    reference to the lieutenant-governor as "The Famous Hair Buyer General"
                    established the moral justification and the propaganda theme for his western strategy. Actually the
                    description had been used a year earlier in a letter to Clark from James Willing, the notorious
                    filibusterer. Willing's reference, however, was to Phillipe de Rocheblave, the British
                    representative at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>
                    </placeName> who had learned the art of frontier fighting from Charles Langlade during the French
                    and Indian War. Clark knew Rocheblave's reputation, and upon entering <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>
                    </placeName> he promptly loaded the gentleman with irons, confiscated his property, and locked him
                    in a hog pen. Rocheblave was soon released from his shackles, and Governor Henry later directed that
                    his property should be returned, but not before Clark had made his views clear and offered a preview
                    of his behavior once the principal villain fell into his hands.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

            <p>When Hamilton realized the futility of continued fighting and asked Clark in the traditional manner
                    for terms, he received an unexpected response. In Clark's mind he deserved no terms at all.

                    Hamilton's request for an explanation, Clark spoke frankly: now that he had within his

                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>

                    thought proper that the Cries of the Widows and Fatherless on the Frontiers that they had occationed
                    now Required their Blood from my Hands…." <placeName>

                    </placeName> tried a feeble defense, but Clark was not listening. He ended the conversation with a
                    burst of passion: "my blood glows within my veins to think on the crueltys your Indian
                    parties have committed…."<hi rend="sup">41</hi> Of course Clark was often
                    unrestrained in his speech. He acted and spoke boldly, and one can assume that he did not always
                    mean all that he said. He did finally offer <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> and his men terms, very broad ones it is true, but terms nonetheless; yet, there would
                    seem no reason not to take him at his word. Circumstances led him to make concessions, even to
                    moderate his views of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but he never ceased to think of him as the "Hair Buyer" or to
                    believe that Indian warfare, abetted by the British, constituted a breach of civil order.</p>
            <p>How deeply Clark felt became evident after Hamilton's surrender. He first permitted the
                    British and French captives who had taken no part in Indian depredations to leave for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>; then, despite the formal capitulation, Clark ordered all the prisoners who had
                    accompanied Indians on their raids to be put in irons—neck, hands, and feet. Only after a
                    vigorous protest by Hamilton was the order left unexecuted. Without the intervention of the
                    townspeople, a number of the French partisans would have been hanged. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> believed that his own life had been threatened, and on one occasion he fled from his
                    quarters. In time Clark softened. Hamilton's gentlemanly bearing and apparent rectitude led
                    Clark to grant him and his men the freedom of the fort, but he did not change his views on
                    Hamilton's ultimate guilt. Consequently, on March 8, 1779, the lieutenant-governor and
                    twenty-six of his followers were dispatched under guard to <placeName>

                    continued by his successors. If anything, the situation had become worse. Now, when Indians arrived
                    with prisoners or scalps, the fort magazines were thrown open for them to choose their own rewards.
                    Hamilton's defeat and capture had merely raised "the price now given for the Blood
                    of the Innocent women &amp; Children on our Frontiers." Clark had turned the

               </placeName>, when an order arrived from
                    Jefferson directing that the lieutenant-governor and the Indian partisan William La Mothe should be
                    confined in chains. Two days later, June 16, 1779, they reached <placeName>

                    </placeName>, wet, hungry, and tired, and were forced to wait in the rain in front of the
                    governor's palace while the officer in charge reported. They were then deposited in the
                    common jail. Here Hamilton and La Mothe found Philip DeJean, the <placeName>

                    until his gout flared and forced the jailer to replace the irons with handcuffs. At the end of
                    August the prisoners were joined by Jehu Hay, a deputy Indian agent, and four other officers. Early
                    in October the irons were removed completely and the prisoners offered parole to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> Courthouse. La Mothe and DeJean accepted, but the others declined and remained in the <placeName>

                    formal capitulation to Clark, Hamilton suffered even more severely than a common criminal. In time,
                    his confinement became less stringent, and he gained his freedom ultimately in keeping with the
                    eighteenth-century procedures governing prisoner exchange. In the face of circumstances, prudent
                    advice, and a British threat of retaliation, Jefferson had relented, but he continued to believe
                    that Hamilton's behavior merited in strict justice the humiliation of heavy irons and close
                    confinement. He recorded his views in an order issued by the <placeName>

                    concerning the treatment that the lieutenant-governor and his aide might expect. The council accused <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> of "inciting the Indians to perpetuate their accustomed cruelties"
                    and of offering "standing rewards for scalps, but… none for prisoners."
                    To implement his policy, he had called a great Indian council to gather at the mouth of the
                        <geogName>Tennessee River</geogName>. The Americans found substantiation for their case in one
                    of Hamilton's proclamations left by the warriors with the bodies of frontier patriots after
                    one of their raids. In addition, the council accused DeJean and La Mothe of aiding <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> in inciting this frontier crime wave. After listing the usual British and Indian
                    atrocities against the western settlements, Jefferson took the occasion to expand his indictment to
                    cover the British handling of prisoners. On this issue "the conduct of the British
                    officers, civil and military, has in its general tenor, through the whole course of this war been
                    savage and unprecedented among civilized nations."<hi rend="sup">45</hi> In making his
                    case, of course, Jefferson seized upon every possible item to put the British in the worst light. In
                    stretching the argument to include the "general tenor" of British attitudes, he
                    had done a great deal more. He had, in fact, revealed how profound he believed the argument between

            <p>In his discussion with General Phillips, Jefferson became enmeshed in the issue of
                    Hamilton's capitulation. Believing, as did Jefferson, that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> had placed himself beyond the law, Clark had demanded unconditional surrender, but he
                    had not possessed sufficient force to insist. As a result, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> had obtained terms and had marched out of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> with military honors. The terms, however, did not touch upon the later treatment of the
                    prisoners, nor did they prohibit confinement in the common jail or the wearing of irons. Jefferson
                    interpreted this absence of specific limitations as a license to impose the kind of punishment he
                    believed <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> richly deserved. Phillips argued Hamilton's innocence of the charges and
                    maintained that in any case he could not, because of the formal submission with terms, be dealt with
                    so severely. Opinion at the Continental Congress supported Jefferson's view. So also on
                    first consideration did General <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                    the face of international usage and would very likely provoke British retaliation. Hence Jefferson
                    changed his policy but not his opinions.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After his early statement in the council's order, Jefferson dropped any reference to scalp
                    buying. Apparently he lost confidence in the testimony of John Dodge, upon whom the council had
                    relied heavily and who had in great measure been responsible for spreading misinformation about
                    Hamilton's activities. Without Dodge, the scalp-buying accusation rested on thin evidence;
                    consequently, Jefferson stressed Hamilton's guilt for mistreating prisoners and inciting
                    the Indians to "savage" war.</p>
            <p>Jefferson made his point with stark simplicity. By instigating the warriors' rage to kill, <placeName>

                    </placeName> himself became a murderer, in fact little different from a "savage."
                    Because Jefferson identified a just society with nature, the issue involved not only the integrity
                    of civil order but the very sanctity of nature. It was not simply the cruelty and brutality of
                    native warfare that <list type="footnotes">

                    their manner of fighting sought "to extinguish human nature." In response to this
                    threat, he felt no obligation to adhere to the hallowed usages of eighteenth-century war. He had, in
                    effect, reduced the conflict between Britain and America to metaphysics, an insight far removed from
                    the world of politics and prudent policy. In justification for this act of reductionism, he might,
                    with consistency, have appealed to the revolutionary ideology that formed such an important part of
                    American thinking and feeling in the 1770s and 1780s. Jefferson's own expression of that
                    position had not only condensed the principles of political order to a few simple maxims but had
                    couched them in terms of almost ethereal abstraction. If one could believe Jefferson's
                    Declaration, Americans were engaged in recreating the human polity on a scale never attempted in the
                    past, an effort so delicate and fraught with danger as to incite widespread fear of conspiracy. When
                    the principal conspirators, the British, brought in the native warriors, Jefferson's fears
                    were confirmed. The British attacked American liberty and sought the establishment of an unnatural
                    despotism in the New World. The Indians represented nature denied, an unenlightened and
                    "savage" condition of life that rejected the fulfillment of human existence for
                    which the Americans struggled so manfully. Allied, those two forces constituted for Jefferson an
                    intolerable menace to civilization. Thus he felt fully justified in his unorthodox treatment of <placeName>

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> But Jefferson's tendency to reduce issues to their

                    </placeName> and Clark over the question of the Indian.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Jefferson held identical views of the native people. Both believed that Indians
                    were "savages," that their mode of life was the antithesis of civilization.
                    Hamilton's nagging anxieties over his complicity in the attacks on the frontier, his
                    repeated and futile efforts to conform native warfare to British standards, disclosed the importance
                    he attached to the differentiation between civilization and "savagery." His
                    anxieties dissolved at least partially, however, when he confronted real Indians. True enough, the
                    romantic strain in his approach to the continent and its inhabitants led to an emphasis on the
                    violence inherent <list type="footnotes">

                    Indians transcended that generalization. They revealed a genuine interest and even sympathy for the
                    native people. One should not be surprised, therefore, that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> became an adept practitioner of forest diplomacy and so readily donned native costume
                    or joined the war dance. The American continent had made its mark on <placeName>

                    </placeName> and left him deeply divided in his loyalties.</p>
            <p>Not so George Rogers Clark. He never doubted where his loyalties lay. They resided with the
                    revolutionary cause and the frontier people he strove so mightily to defend. And he knew his
                    enemies. These were the "savage" Indians and the conscienceless British who aided
                    their bloody assaults on the white settlements. How then can one explain his curious affinity for
                    native ways? Was it merely that he suffered the fate of all Indian-haters: he became what he
                    despised? This is very likely true, though in Jeffersonian terms the process might have been
                    described differently. An account of Clark's career in the West read like living proof of
                    Jefferson's perception that civilization and "savagery" constituted
                    opposite images of each other. As the frontiersman plunged into the wilderness and left civil ways
                    behind, he risked transformation into the "savage" who opposed him. In defense of
                    civility he became a "savage." Jefferson saw the first point, the defense of
                    civility, but missed the second; hence, he failed to recognize that his friend Clark might have been
                    an even more dangerous enemy of human nature than the "Famous Hair Buyer
                General."</p>

            <p>Factional conflicts within both the Republican and Democratic parties rocked Indiana politics to its
                    very foundations during the late 1930s. The quarrel between the Paul V. McNutt organization and
                    Senator Frederick Van Nuys nearly rent the Hoosier Democracy asunder. Indeed, at one stage it seemed
                    as if Van Nuys would make common cause with the Republicans in the 1938 midterm elections. The GOP,
                    however, had its own problems. Republican moderates and the strongly conservative Old Guard were
                    locked in mortal combat for control of the party. Factional disputes were nothing new in Indiana;
                    yet, the battles of the Depression era were unusually bitter because they were linked with the
                    political controversies generated by the New Deal. In recent years historians have manifested keen
                    interest in the relationship between the New Deal and the states, but their interpretations of
                    certain issues have differed markedly, while some problems still await full investigation. A study
                    of the Hoosier factional conflicts of the late 1930s can offer some valuable contributions to this
                    debate.</p>
            <p>Two issues are particularly important with regard to the state Democratic parties in the 1930s. James
                    MacGregor Burns has argued that Franklin D. Roosevelt missed an excellent opportunity to liberalize
                    his party during the Depression because he generally remained neutral in state factional disputes.

                    factions to defeat conservative opponents and so placed the New Deal on secure foundations. In
                    contrast, historians such as James T. Patterson contend that the very nature and organization of
                    most state parties made them resistant to the liberalizing influence of presidential
                        intervention.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Since Roosevelt deviated from his customary neutrality to
                    side openly with McNutt, Indiana offers a particularly interesting test case for these conflicting
                    hypotheses.</p>
            <p>Inextricably linked with the debate concerning possible liberalization of the Democratic party is the
                    general question of what impact the New Deal made on state politics. In his classic study of the New
                    Deal, William Leuchtenburg argued that Roosevelt revolutionized the agenda of American politics in
                    the 1930s, when political emphasis shifted to socioeconomic issues that generated partisan divisions
                    of a more ideological nature than had been the case for many years past. Nevertheless, many
                    historians doubt that the change was profound at the state level. In their view patronage and
                    personality politics continued to be more important than ideological issues, particularly when
                    Roosevelt's star appeared to wane in the late 1930s.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> An examination of
                    the way in which the Hoosier Democracy made peace in 1939–1940 and the attitude it
                    thereafter adopted toward the New Deal can test the validity of this viewpoint.</p>
            <p>The state Republican parties have attracted less attention from historians than have the Democrats.
                    Given the predominance of the Democratic party on the federal level, this is understandable, but the
                    1930s still constituted a significant era for the GOP. Several national leaders, notably Arthur H.
                    Vandenburg and Alfred M. Landon, hoped that Republican state parties could forge alliances with
                    conservative Democrats to fight the New Deal on a bipartisan basis.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Nowhere did

                    faction wanted the party to run Van Nuys as its senatorial candidate in 1938. An investigation of
                    why this move failed can provide important clues to explain the general lack of party realignment in
                    American politics during the Depression. Most Republican leaders at national and state levels were
                    also aware that the party had to make concessions toward reformism if it was to offset the immense
                    electoral popularity of the New Deal during the mid-1930s. Even the Indiana GOP, one of the most
                    conservative of all state parties in the 1920s, finally acknowledged the wisdom of this viewpoint.
                    The Hoosier example therefore makes a good case study of the changes that occurred in state
                    Republicanism during the 1930s. Further study of the Indiana political scene during the decade of
                    the 1930s reveals some possible influences that the factional struggles had on the reemergence of
                    the GOP as the dominant party in Indiana.</p>
            <p>The Democratic factional conflict of 1937–1938 was the culmination of a struggle for the
                    leadership of the Hoosier Democracy. The struggle had commenced when the party had won power in 1932

                    McNutt. McNutt's overriding ambition was to become president, and his rising star attracted
                    support from younger Democrats, certain business interests, and the American Legion, an organization
                    that he had once served as national commander. McNutt also had many allies in the legal profession,
                    an important force in state politics, since he had formerly been dean of Indiana
                    University's Law School.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Older Democrats tended to support either Van
                    Nuys, who had made many allies during his thirty years of party service, or R. Earl Peters, the
                    state chairman who had done much to revive the party's fortunes following the electoral

            <p>Outsiders found it difficult to comprehend the patterns of this factional mosaic partly because so
                    many groups were involved and partly because the internal divisions were not the product of
                    ideological, social, cultural, or regional factors. Even a veteran politician such as the
                    president's aide, Louis M. Howe, had to confess: "I do not pretend to keep track
                    of what goes on about the Indiana mess!"<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Nonetheless, Hoosier
                    factional conflict had a clear logic insofar as its participants were concerned since it centered
                    upon patronage issues. During the late nineteenth century when the Indiana parties had battled to
                    retain their traditional constituencies and corral the floating vote in a series of closely fought
                    elections, they had found it expedient to build well-organized machines that were adept at
                    mobilizing electoral support. As a result, patronage-oriented politics gained primacy over
                    issue-oriented politics in the Hoosier party system since party workers expected to be rewarded from
                    the spoils of office for their expertise at getting out the vote. Factionalism proved to be an
                    inherent feature of patronage politics, which continued to be the principal concern of the parties
                    even in the twentieth century, because the victors inevitably squabbled over the division of spoils
                    after elections. The power of state party leaders depended greatly on their ability to reward their
                    personal followers, and, therefore, struggles between rivals tended to center upon questions of
                    patronage control rather than political principles.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Because of the state Democratic party's weakness in the 1920s no faction had established
                    undisputed leadership; it was hardly surprising, therefore, that quarrels about the distribution of
                    spoils flared up almost immediately after the Democrats gained office in 1933. By 1936, however,
                    McNutt had done much to establish his dominance within the Indiana party, a vital step in his quest
                    for the presidency, by increasing his <list type="footnotes">

                    of 1933, which reduced the number of state departments from 169 to eight, gave the
                    governor's office unprecedented control over appointments. State employees also had to
                    contribute 2 percent of their income to the newly formed Hoosier Democratic Club, which became
                    NcNutt's personal treasury because he appointed its officers.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> The
                    latter innovation alienated Peters, who wanted the funds to go to the regular party treasury, which
                    he controlled. When McNutt outmaneuvered him on this issue, Peters resigned office to seek the 1934
                    senatorial nomination, confident that he could undermine his rival's growing prestige by
                    winning a first ballot victory.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> By astute use of his new patronage powers the
                    governor was able to sway many delegates who had promised to support Peters into voting for his
                    candidate, Sherman Minton. This defeat eliminated the former state chairman as a leading force in
                    Hoosier politics. McNutt's easy victory surprised Van Nuys, who had remained neutral in the
                    hope that his rivals would weaken each other by having to fight a protracted struggle. To protect
                    his own position the senator now had to challenge McNutt himself by supporting Kirk
                    McKinney's bid to win the 1936 gubernatorial nomination.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>It was at this juncture that the New Deal was sucked into the murky waters of Hoosier factional
                    conflict. All the rival Democratic leaders had already voiced support for Roosevelt's
                    policies in acknowledgement of the president's popularity, but this ideological consensus
                    had not lessened Democratic factionalism. In fact the New Deal had increased the scope for
                    intraparty conflict because the vast expansion of federal jobs in the 1930s added a new layer to the
                    spoils system. At first the Roosevelt administration treated the three main leaders fairly equally,
                    but from 1934 onward it increasingly channelled its burgeoning patronage, especially Works Progress
                    Administration (WPA) jobs, toward McNutt in recognition of his newly established primacy. Already
                    cut off from state jobs, Van Nuys now found that his federal patronage was restricted to a few
                    scraps, mainly control over Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) posts; consequently, he
                    adopted a new strategy in early <list type="footnotes">

                    McNutt's standing with the federal government. Breaking his record of strong support for
                    the New Deal, Van Nuys made some speeches that criticized recent federal labor legislation. More
                    seriously, he also charged that Indiana's WPA administrator, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> Coy, had pressured job holders in this agency to support the nomination of
                    McNutt's gubernatorial candidate, M. Clifford Townsend, and that local allies had forced
                    relief workers to run on their county precinct and convention delegate slates.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Van Nuys's allegations embarrassed Roosevelt rather than McNutt since the president was just
                    about to ask Congress for a massive relief appropriation. An infuriated Harry L. Hopkins, federal
                    relief administrator, commented: "he doesn't have to prove this to make it
                    bad—just the fact a Democratic senator says it!"<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Contrary
                    to Van Nuys's charges, a federal investigation revealed that no jobholders associated with
                    Van Nuys or Greenlee had been dismissed, nor would any admit to having been pressured to support
                    Townsend. No one had been denied relief work for political reasons, and relatively few precinct
                    workers held WPA patronage jobs in the two cities about which Van Nuys had particularly complained, <placeName>

                    Nuys's charges of financial waste carried little weight when it was discovered that the WPA

                    apparent preconvention strength. These proven tactics could be employed against Van Nuys when he had
                    to seek renomination in 1938. As the journalist Maurice Early commented, "delegates, being
                    politicians, usually have some irons in the fire and the arm of the state government is
                        long."<hi rend="sup">16</hi> In 1937 McNutt departed to become high commissioner in the

                    Frank McHale, his political advisor and promoter. The strategy of awaiting the convention before
                    taking action against Van Nuys changed, however, when the senator played a prominent role in the
                    defeat of Roosevelt's plan to reform the Supreme Court.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

                    indication of Roosevelt's intention to purge the leading Democratic conservatives, a policy
                    which reached its climax in the 1938 primary elections. Seizing on what seemed a golden opportunity
                    to legitimize its personal battle with Van Nuys, the McNutt faction launched an immediate attack.
                    Townsend gave the first public expression of the intention to remove the senator when he
                    dramatically informed reporters outside the White House that the Indiana party could not renominate

                    strategy proved to be a costly error. Van Nuys's prospects may well have appeared to be

                    would have been better advised to have kept the quarrel within its original framework as a patronage
                    dispute. Democratic factional controversy had lost its impetus since the 1936 convention because
                    McNutt's ultimate victory seemed inevitable. Roosevelt's intervention breathed new
                    life into the conflict by giving it the ideological dimension of Van Nuys's attitude toward
                    the New Deal. In these circumstances the senator found new sources of support from conservative

            <p>Hoosiers' support for the New Deal declined dramatically from mid-1937 on. The unpopularity
                    of the Judiciary Bill, Roosevelt's "court-packing" scheme, provided the
                    initial impetus. Many local Democratic politicians and large numbers of voters who had supported
                    Roosevelt in the previous election regarded Supreme Court reform as a threat to the Constitution.
                    Five Democratic congressmen broke ranks to voice their opposition to the bill, while loyalists like
                    James I. Farley of the Fourth District faced strong criticism from their constituents.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> This outcry encouraged Van Nuys, whose plight had hitherto aroused little public
                    interest, to declare that he would run as an independent if he was denied his party's
                    nomination. His counterattack depicted him as a Jeffersonian Democrat who had thwarted
                    Roosevelt's attempt to subvert the Constitution and bucked McNutt's dictatorial
                    control of the state party.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> This strategy did not entail a direct indictment
                    of the New Deal, a logical tactic since the senator had rendered Roosevelt sterling support prior to
                    1937. Nevertheless, Van Nuys became the rallying point for conservative Democratic opposition to the
                    president's socioeconomic policies in late 1937.</p>
            <p>Rural Democrats, especially those from southern Indiana, tended to be more conservative than their
                    urban counterparts. They had supported the early New Deal because it had had some success in
                    promoting the recovery of the agrarian economy. Indiana farmers became disenchanted after 1935,
                    however, because they felt that federal policies now showed far more concern for industrial recovery
                    and urban relief problems than for their difficulties. Their open break with the New Deal came in
                    the fall of 1937 when the so-called "Roosevelt Recession" led to a decline of
                    commodity prices and aroused fierce resentment of crop restriction policies, high taxes, and federal
                    welfare spending.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> In these circumstances it was inevitable <list type="footnotes">

                    New Deal. Although the senator did not identify explicitly with agrarian criticism of federal
                    policies, he fuelled its fires by persisting with his allegations concerning McNutt's
                    corrupt use of the WPA, the welfare agency that farmers considered most guilty of waste and
                    discrimination in favor of the cities.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> In view of the nationwide agrarian
                    disillusionment with the New Deal in 1937–1938, the ideological harmony of the Indiana
                    Democrats was bound to falter, but the Van Nuys affair acted as a catalyst which intensified their
                    divisions.</p>
            <p>By mid-1938 it was evident that the senator's independent campaign could draw off so many
                    Democratic votes that the Republicans would win the election. No longer was Van Nuys merely an
                    irritating thorn in the side of the statehouse organization. He had become a major threat to

                    in 1938 if he was to be regarded as a serious contender for the Democratic presidential nomination
                    two years later. His prospects of obtaining the nomination would also be hurt by the nationwide
                    publicity that Van Nuys's allegations were bound to attract as the Indiana election
                    campaign gathered momentum. Finally, since Roosevelt now appeared unlikely to purge his conservative
                    opponents, they could exact revenge for Van Nuys by leading anti-McNutt delegations to the 1940
                    national Democratic convention. McNutt therefore decided to compromise. Through a series of
                    telephone calls from Manila, he commanded Townsend to offer their opponent the nomination.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This decision to support Van Nuys angered Roosevelt for he was still engaged in his own purge
                    strategy and it was widely reported that the senator's victory boosted the morale of
                    several colleagues who faced renomination problems, especially Alva Adams of <placeName>

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> McNutt's climb-down marked the first significant break
                    in his support for Roosevelt's policies. The results of the 1938 elections widened the
                    breach. Although Van Nuys triumphed narrowly, Hoosier Republicans won the secretaryship of state,
                    their first statewide victory since 1928, recaptured six congressional seats, gained control of the
                    lower house of the state legislature, and barely failed to secure a senate majority. All the pundits
                    agreed that the result was attributable to the unpopularity of the New Deal during the
                    "Roosevelt Recession";<hi rend="sup">26</hi> consequently, the McNutt faction
                    decided to distance itself further from the Roosevelt administration in a bid to restore the unity
                    of the state party and regain electoral support.</p>
            <p>The dilution of McNutt's identification with the New Deal did not constitute a significant
                    change in his political principles. Even though McNutt had been one of the best governors of the
                    Depression era, in essence he was a pragmatist who would rarely buck the prevailing political
                    currents. His gubernatorial record was certainly impressive, not least because he <list type="footnotes">

                            group's failure to find an obvious replacement for him. Sam Jackson, an early
                            choice, was ruled out to appease Peters. The spotlight then fell on Henry F. Schricker, who
                            reluctantly agreed to run but never hid his preference for the 1940 gubernatorial
                            nomination. <hi rend="i">Ibid.,</hi> June 1, July 6, 1938.</item>

                    of Roosevelt's, whereas most other state executives had awaited federal action. After
                    restoring the solvency of the state treasury, largely by enacting a gross income tax and reducing
                    the administrative costs of government, he had introduced a series of reforms which included
                    old-age-pension legislation, prohibition of yellow dog contracts, and better relief administration.
                    His government had also cooperated promptly and efficiently with the New Deal programs.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Without decrying his achievements, it should be noted that he enacted his
                    reform program when there was a desperate need for action; he thus did not encounter any serious
                    opposition from a pliant state legislature. Moreover, his firm support for the New Deal projected
                    him as a potential successor to Roosevelt when the liberal wave was at high tide. When the political
                    climate changed, so did McNutt's commitment to the New Deal, as evidenced by his handling
                    of the Van Nuys affair.</p>
            <p>When McNutt eventually announced his bid for the presidential nomination in 1939, he projected
                    himself as a moderate capable of uniting the warring forces in the national party. Because they had
                    never fully trusted him, neither Roosevelt nor his closest advisers had ever supported
                    McNutt's aspirations. His new position only confirmed their opinion that he was an
                    opportunist. Somewhat true to form McNutt reverted to outright liberalism in 1940, hoping in vain to
                    gain Roosevelt's support for the vice-presidential nomination after the
                    president's third-term intentions had become evident.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite McNutt's reconversion in terms of national politics during 1940, his Indiana allies
                    clung to the course upon which the denouement of the Van Nuys affair had launched them. Nothing
                    illustrates their movement away from a strongly pro-New Deal position better than their strategy to
                    keep the governorship in Democratic hands, their overriding concern in the 1940 elections since this
                    office controlled patronage distribution. In 1936, when Roosevelt's prestige was at its
                    zenith, the McNutt group had hitched its wagon to his star by nominating <list type="footnotes">

                    Townsend did indeed prove a more liberal governor than McNutt. Whereas McNutt's relations

                    Guard during the 1933 coalfield strikes, Townsend publically identified with the unions'
                    cause. On one occasion he put pressure on a steel company to grant strikers a union contract, and he
                    also added a Department of Labor to the state government setup. Less committed to economy than
                    McNutt, who had built up a treasury surplus of $7,000,000 by 1937, Townsend also
                    increased state expenditure on public works.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> In 1940, however, the McNutt

                    Britain in the European war threatened the slim majority that the Indiana Democrats had to defend.
                    Schricker's nomination also restored some unity to the state party. Conservative Democrats
                    considered him an acceptable candidate; he was not closely associated with any particular faction,
                    and he favored a more equitable distribution of patronage than McNutt had hitherto countenanced. His
                    candidacy also enabled the state party to downplay ideological issues by capitalizing on his
                    personal popularity, especially since he faced an obscure Republican opponent in Glenn R. Hillis,

                    hat. These personality issues had a perennial appeal in Indiana politics. In contrast to the 1936
                    election the state organization downplayed presidential policies in the 1940 campaign, except in
                    Democratic urban strongholds such as Gary, <placeName>

                    the boss."<hi rend="sup">32</hi> This strategy had much in common with that of the 1928
                    campaign, when Hoosier Democrats abandoned Alfred E. Smith as a lost cause, concentrated on winning
                    the governorship, and emphasized the personal virtues of their candidate in the hope of capitalizing
                    on Republican corruption scandals.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 1940 campaign suggests that Roosevelt had much less success in changing the agenda of state as
                    opposed to national politics. Hoosier Democratic leaders had the power to eschew ideological or
                    programmatic politics and to focus on state and personality issues whenever such a strategy suited
                    their purposes. The state Democratic organization assumed that the New Deal's sustained
                    popularity in the larger cities would benefit the whole ticket and that Schricker would run far
                    enough ahead of the president elsewhere to ensure his own victory. It could be argued that this
                    strategy was responsible for Roosevelt's failure to carry the state. While Schricker won,
                    the president lost Indiana by only 25,000 votes despite the disadvantage of facing a native son
                    opponent, Wendell L. Willkie. Stronger support from the state organization might have tipped the
                    balance in Roosevelt's favor. Senator Sherman Minton, a "100% New Dealer"
                    who was also beaten, complained of being double-crossed.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Roosevelt's
                    popularity continued to decline after the election, particularly because his wartime agricultural
                    policies alienated the normally Democratic counties of southern Indiana; consequently, the state
                    organization persisted in avoiding a close identification with his administration in the interests
                    of preserving party harmony and maintaining rural support.</p>

            <p>In view of the outcome of the Van Nuys affair and the resultant Hoosier Democratic policy,
                    Indiana's experience lends weight to the view that Roosevelt had no realistic prospects of
                    creating a liberal party by intervening in state disputes. It is highly unlikely that he would have
                    been more successful had he taken action before 1937 when his prestige was undiminished. Several
                    Hoosiers did implore him to intervene and restore the harmony of the state party in
                    1935–1936, but none occupied a prominent position in the warring factions. The dispute
                    was patronage-oriented at that stage, and the powerful McNutt would have resented any presidential
                    attempt to establish a compromise when he appeared to have total victory within his grasp.
                    Accordingly, the Democratic National Committee chairman, James A. Farley, advised Roosevelt not to
                    involve himself.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Even had the president acted to help McNutt achieve victory
                    in the early 1930s, he would still not have guaranteed the triumph of liberalism because his
                    prospective allies, as their conduct later indicated, were pragmatists rather than idealists. His
                    eventual intervention, coinciding with the decline of his popularity, only served to demonstrate the
                    dangers of mistiming. McNutt probably had better prospects of transforming the party because he
                    could have used his unprecedented patronage powers to promote committed liberals to leadership
                    positions. He regarded the governorship principally as a stepping-stone to the White House, however,
                    and had no desire to engage in risky ventures to reform the Hoosier Democracy.</p>
            <p>Other factors peculiar to Indiana's political culture also helped to limit the prospects of
                    liberalizing the state Democratic party. In several northern industrial states Democratic urban
                    machines had espoused a pragmatic welfare liberalism during the Progressive era; therefore, the New
                    Deal had a political kinship with influential factions in states such as <placeName>

                    natural constituency of the machines in other states. As a result, rural southern Indiana, where
                    politics were generally conservative, retained its traditional preponderant influence within the
                    Hoosier Democratic party. Despite the growing significance of the urban vote in the New Deal era, no
                    leader rose to prominence in the state party during the 1930s on the basis of his identification
                    with the cities. There were no Hoosier equivalents of James M. Curley, Edward Kelly, or Robert F.
                    Wagner. Moreover, the statehouse tended to favor rural areas and small towns disproportionately in
                    the distribution of spoils. Political organizations in the urban counties therefore lacked the means
                    to develop machines as adept at winning the city vote as their counterparts in other states.
                    Organized labor did not become a major political force in Indiana during the Roosevelt era, even
                    though it helped to liberalize the state Democratic parties in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Even in these midwestern states, labor forces, despite facing very weak Democratic
                    organizations, did not attain success until the 1940s when they had support from other interest
                    groups. Indiana's convention system enabled party leaders to block challenges to their
                    power, whereas the primary system of nomination would have allowed labor to exert greater influence.
                    It was also difficult to coordinate Hoosier unions to undertake political action on a statewide
                    basis because there was no all-powerful group, such as <placeName>

                    The Old Guard, which had dominated the state Republican organization for over thirty years, was
                    opposed to government intervention in the economy and was strongly conservative on social issues, as
                    exemplified by its toleration of Ku Klux Klan influence in the party during the 1920s. This group

                    Watson's defeat in the 1932 senatorial election and that of his ally, Senator Arthur R.
                    Robinson, in 1934, encouraged younger Republicans to challenge Old Guard leadership. Initially their
                    predominant concern was to obtain greater say in patronage matters.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Following
                    the crushing Republican defeats in the 1936 elections, the dispute broadened to encompass a debate
                    over political principles. Many Hoosier Republicans became convinced that their party had to modify
                    its conservatism if it was ever to regain office. In these circumstances the most significant
                    challenge faced by the Old Guard came from the faction led by Ralph F. Gates, the Fourth District
                    party chairman. This group drew its main support from northern Indiana, particularly the urban
                    areas, and the Republican Editorial Association, which had broken with Watson over the Klan
                        issue.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Gates's supporters launched their challenge in 1937; but,
                    although they ousted some Watson allies from the state committee in May, the Old Guard still
                    retained great influence and succeeded in getting its candidates chosen as state chairman and
                    national committeeman in October.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> The struggle between the two groups then
                    centered upon the 1938 senatorial nomination when Watson declared his candidacy and the Gates group
                    supported the <placeName>

                    characterized Willis as a conservative, he regarded himself as a "liberalized
                        Republican."<hi rend="sup">42</hi> A description of his views provides some insight
                    into the politics of the Gates group. Willis advocated a pragmatic acceptance of the most popular
                    aspects of the New Deal. He rejected the old Republican notions that government should not intervene
                    to deal with economic and unemployment problems and thus declared himself in favor of temporary WPA
                    relief aid and contributory social security and old-age pensions.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Regarding

                    approval, and he endorsed labor's right to strike, although he disapproved of the National
                    Labor Relations Board because he thought that it discriminated in favor of the unions when it
                    mediated in industrial disputes.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Willis's views, it is worth noting,
                    were more progressive than the national Republican party's 1936 platform, which had
                    criticized the unemployment insurance and old-age-pension provisions of the Social Security Act.
                    Significantly, his most direct indictments against New Deal policies in 1938 focused upon
                    Roosevelt's agricultural program and the reciprocal trade treaties, which farmers opposed.
                    Otherwise Willis's criticisms tended to center upon issues such as the costs, corruption,
                    and inefficiency of Democratic relief administration, issues which did not entail a direct challenge
                    to the principles of federal unemployment policies.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Willis had not, of course, become a full-fledged liberal. His criticisms of the New Deal's
                    inefficiency were often opportunistic and unconstructive. Although he insisted that only the revival
                    of business confidence could generate full economic recovery, he did not explain how the Republicans
                    would help promote a sufficient expansion of the private sector economy to eliminate unemployment;
                    nor did he indicate how they would improve relief administration. While he accepted certain aspects
                    of Roosevelt's programs, he was critical of the New Deal in general. His letters and
                    campaign oratory of 1938 stressed that the benefits of the New Deal were outweighed by its dangerous
                    consequences, which he identified as its encouragement of radicalism—exemplified by the
                    sit-down strikes—the debilitating effect of its bureaucratic regimentation upon the
                    spirit of individual enterprise, and its shackling of private business through the expansion of
                    governmental power and high taxation.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> In essence, Willis, like the majority of
                    the Gates group, was a pragmatic, moderate conservative who accepted that reform was necessary and

            <p>Initially Watson seemed the stronger candidate, especially when he undermined hopes of northern unity
                    by concluding an agreement with Oliver Starr, the Gary mayor who had also entered the race, to pool
                    delegates on later ballots. A similar deal appeared to be in the offing when Walter Bossert, a
                    former Klan regional leader, declared his candidacy.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> The apparent decline of
                    Willis's prospects led to one of the most interesting episodes of a politically eventful

                    </placeName> Republicans, proposed that the party should nominate Van Nuys as its senatorial
                    candidate.</p>
            <p>Several nationally influential figures, such as Alfred M. Landon and publisher Frank Gannett, had
                    expressed hopes that Van Nuys would accept a Republican draft. The bipartisan opposition to the
                    Judiciary Bill and Roosevelt's purge strategy had raised their hopes for a national
                    coalition between conservative Democrats and their party to oppose New Deal liberals.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

                    </placeName> Republicans had a more limited objective. Their overriding concern in proposing Van
                    Nuys's candidacy was to ensure that Watson did not win the nomination and thereby restore
                    the dominance of the Old Guard in the state party.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> A curious mixture of Irish

                    withstood the urban trend favoring Democrats to win control of city hall in 1934. Accordingly, they
                    acknowledged the need for emergency federal relief aid and certain social reforms and accepted
                    labor's right to organize as "ordinary justice."<hi rend="sup">52</hi>

                    Hoping to increase his opponents' disarray, Watson initially allowed some of his
                    supporters, notably state chairman Arch Bobbitt, to express vague interest in a Van Nuys coalition
                    but then personally condemned the proposal just before the convention met.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite the hopes of several nationally important figures, Indiana did not provide the first stimulus
                    for a realignment of the party system in 1938. Hoosier coalitionists, in fact, constituted only a
                    small group within one of the state's Republican factions. The coalition proposal faced
                    overwhelming opposition from most county chairmen, who complained that Van Nuys would not help their
                    local and congressional tickets, which faced partisan opponents. They also disliked the implications
                    of bipartisanship regarding the distribution of patronage. Many Republicans noted, too, that because
                    Van Nuys's voting record was "95% pro New Deal" he seemed ill-suited to
                    lead a campaign against Roosevelt's policies.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> The senator himself
                    offered the coalitionists little encouragement, declaring on several occasions that he was
                    "too much of a Democrat" to join forces with the Republicans, a good indication of
                    his confidence about his eventual renomination.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> McNutt probably hoped that the
                    senator would accept a Republican draft—which action would have exposed him to calumny as
                    a turncoat—for the former governor conceded Van Nuys's renomination immediately
                    on learning of Willis's selection by the GOP. Just before the convention Gates had managed
                    to outflank the Watson-Starr alliance by negotiating an agreement whereby the other three candidates
                    pooled their delegates in favor of Willis after the first ballot. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>

            </p>
            <p>If Watson's defeat removed the greatest threat to the emergence of moderate Republicanism,
                    Willis's nomination still did not ensure the primacy of the Gates faction. The only clear
                    result of the convention was that it reaffirmed the power of party regularity and the impotence of
                    the Klan, for Bossert won least delegate support. The leadership issue was unresolved <list type="footnotes">

                    balance in favor of the Gates faction.</p>
            <p>In August, 1938, the morale of the Hoosier Republican party received a much-needed lift when the
                    famous Cornfield Conference was held at Homer E. Capehart's farm. Although the state,
                    regional, and national leaders who addressed the gathering represented a variety of viewpoints, the
                    Indiana party as a whole received its most direct exposure to date to the views of Republicans who
                    advocated a pragmatic acceptance of some New Deal measures. Not only did the publicity spotlight
                    fall upon Willis, but Glenn Frank, chairman of the Republican Program Committee, and Capehart
                    himself, though not yet committed to a political career, spoke of the need for governmental action
                    on certain economic and social issues.<hi rend="sup">59</hi> The Cornfield Conference thus
                    undoubtedly helped the cause of moderate Republicanism in Indiana, but it was the outcome of the
                    1938 elections that provided the decisive boost to moderates' fortunes.</p>
            <p>While rural Republicans focused their campaign against federal farm policy, the urban county
                    organizations found it expedient to direct their fire against the shortcomings of federal relief and
                    welfare programs, a particularly potent criticism since Indiana's WPA allocation had
                    received severe cuts before the onset of the recession. County chairmen advised Willis not to

            <p>In some ways a new Republican party emerged out of the factional and electoral battles of 1938. The
                    party's political views had changed because it now realized the wisdom of adopting a more
                    pragmatic approach to the New Deal than the old conservative leaders had countenanced. Although
                    Willis won a clear majority of the rural vote in 1938 by capitalizing on agrarian antipathy toward
                    federal farm policy, it was equally significant that he regained much of the ground lost by the
                    Republicans in the small towns and the cities in the Democratic landslides of 1932 and 1936. Indeed,
                    it was widely believed that only vote fraud in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake County</region>
                    </placeName> had denied him overall victory, for Van Nuys won by only 5,000 votes, over 200,000 less
                    than his 1932 majority. Willis's good showing justified the contention of the Gates group
                    that by accepting the most popular features of the New Deal and concentrating their fire on its less
                    successful policies the Republicans could do much to neutralize Roosevelt's appeal in
                    Indiana. Having therefore proved that orthodox conservatism was out of touch with the conditions of
                    the 1930s, younger elements were finally able to wrest control from the Old Guard and give the
                    Republican party a new leadership.</p>
            <p>The changes of 1938 were important but limited. While the Gates faction did not retract its previous
                    acceptance of certain liberal reforms, neither did it use its new influence to prod the party into
                    making further concessions to New Deal policies. Pragmatic conservatism continued to be the basis of
                    Republican politics, and the political climate after 1938 did not require a more liberal approach
                    than that adopted in the midterm elections. The Republicans also had to be careful that their
                    pragmatic attitude toward reform, which appealed mainly to the urban electorate, did not offend
                    their rural supporters, many of whom remained strongly antipathetic to the New Deal. This was
                    particularly the case regarding the WPA. Hoosier farmers grew more hostile than ever to this agency
                    in 1939–1940, expressing resentment that it deprived them of cheap seasonal labor and
                    that the federal government overtaxed rural areas to <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The limits of change in the Hoosier Republican party were underlined in the early 1940s when a group

                    especially his internationalist ideals, were too liberal for many of the Gates faction to stomach.

                    significant influence upon Hoosier politics. In the 1940s the young senator, William E. Jenner,
                    assumed Watson's mantle and rekindled the ideological fervor of the party's right
                    wing. Jenner's rise led to renewed factional conflict during the late 1940s and 1950s when
                    the Gates group, which had never forgotten the lessons of the Depression era concerning the virtues
                    of moderate politics, strove to limit Jenner's influence.<hi rend="sup">66</hi>

            <p>The results of the 1940 election confirmed that the Republicans had effectively reestablished their

                    electoral realignment occurred in Indiana during the 1930s when "urbanite, working-class
                    and ethnically identified voters" moved into the Democratic camp and Republicans gained

                    struggles and their outcome on the parties' electoral support.</p>
            <p>Since agrarian disillusion with the New Deal was nationwide, Democratic factionalism was evidently
                    only an incidental factor in the alienation of the farm vote. Although rural Democrats supported Van
                    Nuys in his battle with McNutt and Roosevelt, he still ran badly in the agricultural areas in 1938,
                    particularly in the corn belt counties. The statehouse's close identification with
                    Roosevelt in 1937–1938 probably increased the midterm ticket's loss of rural
                    support to a small extent. When the state party regained some unity by distancing itself from the
                    New Deal in 1940, Schricker ran ahead of Roosevelt in most rural counties. While his lead usually
                    amounted at best to a few hundred votes, these small margins still proved crucial in the tightly
                    contested election.<hi rend="sup">68</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The outcome of the factional battles arguably had more impact on the urban vote. Indiana was one of
                    only two predominantly urban states which Roosevelt failed to carry in 1940. Having gained 62
                    percent of the votes cast in the seven most urban counties in 1936, he won only 52.9 percent four
                    years later and actually failed to carry <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His modest urban majorities did not counterbalance his heavy losses in the rural areas
                    and small towns. This decline was attributable to several factors: Roosevelt's foreign
                    policy had alienated <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName>-Americans; the middle classes blamed the Democrats for encouraging trade union
                    militancy; and many labor voters expressed their frustrations about the sluggish pace of industrial
                        recovery.<hi rend="sup">69</hi>

                    city hall and consequent control over municipal jobs to build a powerful machine that was very
                    efficient at getting out the vote.<hi rend="sup">70</hi> Moderate Republicans, who had gained power
                    in mid-decade, also had much success in winning votes from groups who had supported Roosevelt in

                    moderate attitudes toward union rights, organizing Labor for Republicans clubs, and publicizing the

                    it is evident that Republican strength was not based entirely on <placeName>

            <p>In the other main urban counties in Indiana the Republicans appear to have made few converts from the
                    New Deal coalition in 1940 as Roosevelt's vote held up well in numerical terms in
                    comparison to 1936. Nevertheless, some connection between the emergence of moderate Republicanism
                    and the increased voter turn-out in 1940 seems evident. Indiana had, in fact, experienced a voter
                    participation surge in the previous presidential elections of the New Deal era. This development
                    interrupted what has become a century-long pattern of declining turn-out and initially benefited the
                    Democrats rather than the Republicans.<hi rend="sup">73</hi> As a recent study has noted, Democratic
                    success in 1932 and 1936 was not wholly attributable to the New Deal's conversion of
                    Republican supporters but also owed much to the activation of voters not previously in the

            </p>
            <p>Turn-out appears to have been especially high in the urban areas. A crude indication of this is
                    provided by the fact that the actual numbers of votes cast in these counties in the 1940
                    presidential election was 12.9 percent greater than in 1936, whereas the increase was only 7.4
                    percent for the state as a whole. Accordingly, the large percentage of decline in
                    Roosevelt's share of the poll in the seven main urban counties only converts into a
                    numerical loss of some 14,000 votes in comparison to his 1936 showing. On the other hand, Willkie
                    gained 100,000 votes more than Landon's tally in 1936 and Hillis 83,000 more than the
                    previous Republican gubernatorial candidate. It seems probable that the increased Republican vote
                    was largely attributable to the reactivation of habitual supporters who had abstained in 1936. The
                    presence of a native-son candidate in Willkie was doubtless an important factor in this development,
                    but it does not seem unreasonable to suggest that the emergence of the "new"
                    Republican party from the factional battles of 1937–1938 was also partly responsible. In
                    other words, many voters who habitually supported the party had abstained in the 1930s because they
                    could not reconcile themselves either to the New Deal or to Old Guard conservatism in the context of
                    the Depression but could now identify with a moderate Republicanism that accepted the need for
                    limited reforms.</p>
            <p>Factional conflict had subsided by 1940 because both parties had been able to resolve their principal
                    disputes. In the Democratic case McNutt's allies retained effective control of the party,
                    but they had been forced to accommodate their opponents' demands for more equitable
                    distribution of patronage and to distance themselves from Roosevelt. It was evident that the New
                    Deal had not transformed the Hoosier Democracy, which continued to show more interest in
                    patronage-oriented politics than ideological issues despite the tribulations of the Depression.
                    Roosevelt could probably have done little to change this state of affairs. "To the victor
                    the spoils" was still the <list type="footnotes">

                    the Republicans. There can be little doubt that the uncertainties of bipartisan patronage
                    distribution constituted a major impediment to the development of coalitionism in 1938.</p>
            <p>This is not to say that the New Deal's impact on Indiana politics was unimportant, merely
                    that it was limited rather than radical. The triumph of the Republican moderates was inextricably
                    bound up with the emergence of a new political consensus in Indiana during the Depression. By 1940
                    nearly all the leading figures of both parties, admittedly with varying degrees of enthusiasm,
                    accepted some of the New Deal's basic principles. Politicians endorsed policies that they
                    would not have countenanced a decade earlier. Some degree of federal intervention to promote
                    economic recovery was now acceptable to them; so was federal unemployment relief; so was a moderate
                    extension of trade union rights; and, probably most important of all because it implied the
                    permanence of the welfare state, so was social security legislation. In this sense Indiana was in
                    tune with nationwide trends; yet, both parties remained pragmatic in their attitudes toward
                    reformism. Electoral disasters suffered by the Old Guard, not newfound idealism, prodded the GOP to
                    endorse certain reforms; consequently, the extent of change to which Republicans would agree was
                    dependent on the ongoing electoral success of the New Deal. Even the Democrats, who had happily
                    clung to Roosevelt's coattails from 1934 to 1936, quickly relinquished this grasp when the
                    going got rough from 1938 to 1940. The state organization was not prepared to identify with those
                    New Deal measures that, regardless of their merit, it thought were electoral liabilities and that
                    threatened Democratic retention of state offices controlling patronage distribution. This
                    disaffection applied in particular to the unpopular farm program, the urban orientation of relief
                    following the "Roosevelt Recession," and the growth of union rights to the point
                    where labor's radical militants appeared to have the support of the New Deal. By 1940 both
                    parties concurred as to the limits of the new consensus, and the factional conflicts of
                    1937–1938 had done much to effect this agreement. Many features of the old party system
                    endured the challenge of the Depression and continued to exert a significant influence on Hoosier
                    politics for years afterward, coexisting comfortably with the changes that had occurred during the
                    1930s. In Indiana, therefore, continuity appears to be as important as change in American state
                    politics during the New Deal era.</p>

                    plans have been found in extant Morton papers. Riel's writings, however, indicate that the

            <p>The hanging of Riel in Regina, in the present-day province of Saskatchewan, did not put an end to

            <p>The letter that Riel wrote to Morton in 1875 dates from a very traumatic, controversial period in the

                    </placeName>, he had never been able to take the seat. Early in 1875 Riel was pardoned for his part
                    in the <geogName>Red River</geogName> uprising, but only on the condition that he would remain

                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> for five more years. One historian has suggested that the period from October, 1873, to
                    December, 1875, was Riel's time of greatest uncertainty. Doubts over whether he was
                    destined to be a political leader or a religious leader had plagued the Canadian since his
                    father's death in 1864. Shortly after that event, Louis had terminated his studies at the

                    </placeName>. By 1873 his indecision and uncertainty had led to the mental anguish that would result
                    in visions, prophecies of a divine mission, and eventual commitment in a violent state to an asylum

                    Fenians or Orangemen), assimilated Indians, and recent European immigrants who might not find a
                    welcome in other regions. Although he never expressed it in such terms, Riel apparently envisioned a
                    Roman Catholic state where French would be the dominant language. At no time did he ever request

                    senator had "expressed his faith in immortality and the Christian system." The
                    same colleague described Morton's religious attitude further: "He seemed not to
                    regard the ceremonial of religion, but believed in a religion of feeling, of works, rather than of
                        opinion."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Since scholars agree that one of the strongest
                    influences on Riel's character was the unique brand of Roman Catholicism that nurtured and
                    was nurtured by the French Canadians in a sense of "divine mission" after the
                    Conquest of 1760, it would seem that Riel should have anticipated problems in dealing with a person
                    who may well have believed that no God existed. On the other hand, Riel could reasonably have
                    related to a "Channing Unitarian." Biographer William Dudley Foulke credits Morton
                    with a study of works by William Paley during Miami University years.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
                    Paley's natural theology philosophies were influential in <placeName>

                    Riel in Quebec.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although Flanagan probably erred in his religious assessment of Morton, his studies have shed much
                    new light on the religious aspects of Riel's life. Some of Riel's later actions
                    were so ludicrous as to seem bizarre. Flanagan, however, has painstakingly and convincingly shown
                    that in all the instability and confusion that surrounded Riel's political and religious
                    leadership, no action was illogical or inconsistent by the Métis leader's own
                        standards.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> All modern studies show that it has been a mistake to portray
                    Riel as a fanatic egotist leading superstitious and misguided outcasts. To appreciate the religious
                    influence and pressure that Riel felt, one must consider the influential role of the Roman Catholic
                    church and clergy among French Canadians. From the time of the Conquest of 1760, the church
                    hierarchy exercised growing power politically and socially, finally reaching the point of virtual
                    control over all aspects of life in Quebec. The missionaries sent among the Indians and
                    Métis expected, and were expected by the parish, to exercise similar power. The
                    ultramontanist position of Quebec clergy, especially after the French revolution, caused them to be
                    critical of what they regarded as papal compromise <list type="footnotes">

                    very real part in Riel's thinking. He expanded on each point, finally concluding that the
                    entire papacy had served its purpose and that God now needed a new prophet in the New World, namely
                    Louis—or "David"—Riel.</p>
            <p>Unsympathetic writers have described Riel's actions as totally and completely mad from the
                    very beginning. His champions, who claim that he has been denied a place in history because of his
                    minority status, call attention to the fact that both friend and foe found it expedient at times to
                    claim that he had been insane or was feigning insanity. Modern scholars agree that some emotional
                    instability and symptoms of mental illness plagued Riel after 1875. A series of apparent delusions,
                    which Riel regarded as divinely prophetic signs and messages directed to him from God, occurred over
                    several years time; and Riel gradually came to believe that he was to be, in addition to a political
                    leader, the new religious leader of a post-papal Catholic church and would replace the Bishop of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was to be the Prophet of the New World.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> An integral part in
                    convincing people of the validity of his divine mission, and in obtaining backing for his political
                    dreams at the same time, was to be the resurrection of Oliver P. Morton!</p>
            <p>Riel had many "signs" from God that he would obtain help from Morton. One, in
                    March, 1878, in Glens Fall, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, consisted of a vision of the American eagle smiling benignly toward the Northwest. At
                    the same time God spoke to him of "Oliver ‘Pie’ Mort-tonne."
                    Riel placed great stock in searching for meanings of French to English (and vice versa) translations
                    and in this instance was using the French for Pius in lieu of Morton's middle initial. In
                    addition, he separated Morton's last name into two French words which could translate as
                    "dead thunder."<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Riel also found it significant that Morton
                    had died on November 1, 1877—exactly two years to the day after Riel had written to offer
                    to heal his infirmity. In snatches of diaries written by Riel after his return from <placeName>

                    </placeName> to Saskatchewan territory, Morton is included in a long series of petitions to God that
                    were composed throughout the winter and spring of 1884–1885. Among the pleas for family
                    members, trusted friends, his beloved Métis, and others, Riel wrote: "My God! If
                    You wish, If You have so decided in Your eternal plans, resurrect Oliver P. <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Morton was evidently unimpressed with Riel's plans and promises. No evidence exists to
                    indicate that the senator replied to Riel's letters in 1875, and certainly Morton was not
                    resurrected after death! The rational, practical, rather aloof senator may well have been taken
                    aback by proposals of an impossible-sounding plan presented in such an intense manner by the
                    emotional, dedicated, devout Riel. In his letter Riel suggests that his difficulties with the
                    English language prevented Morton's full understanding. Although French was his native
                    tongue, Riel both wrote and spoke English well. Pronunciation and word usage may have hampered their
                    communications, but Riel also acknowledged that Morton had objections to the plan which were sound.</p>
            <p>During a traumatic period of his life, while seeking assistance with a highly implausible plan to
                    assist the Métis people to form a state without danger of annexation to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, what might Riel have seen in Morton that caused him to view the senator as the very
                    key to his success? Several speculative possibilities occur.</p>
            <p>Since Riel knew Morton purely by reputation, he may have been impressed by the accounts of
                    Morton's wartime leadership of Indiana. The action of financing the state through personal
                    loans and financial arrangements rather than calling a hostile legislature into session almost
                    assuredly would have appeared magnificent to Riel. He would have admired the mind that devised the
                    scheme of denying the legislative session a quorum, the character that could rely on friends and
                    associates to provide the funds, and the courage that enabled the successful governor to run for
                    reelection in 1864 in the hope that he <list type="footnotes">

                    However, unlike Morton, he was not welcome in the seat of government and thus never took his seat.</p>
            <p>During the post-Civil War decades the Republican party in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> received much credit for freeing the slaves. In <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> the Métis had long been objects of discrimination on two counts of minority
                    status: francophonic and half-breed. They viewed the freed black in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as holding a somewhat analagous position. As a leading Senate Republican after the war,
                    Morton supported the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the Constitution. His role in their
                    passage would probably have enhanced Riel's belief in the senator as a champion of the
                    oppressed, even though Morton, as did other leaders of the time, denied that blacks were the
                    "social" equal of whites.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> In addition, Riel might well find
                    in Morton's Senate speeches reasons to believe that the Indiana senator was ahead of the
                    pack in favoring political rights for other minority groups. The extended debate over the admission
                    of the Pembina, or Algonquin, territory in the first session of the Fortythird Congress was of
                    interest to Riel since many Métis lived within the proposed boundaries. Morton's
                    vote against admitting the territory was cast only after he had argued intently on May 28, 1874, for
                    an amendment which would have granted full rights to all citizens—even
                    women—in the territory.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Similarly, on February 13, 1875, Morton

                    a nation, such as the Union had rightly put down, and rebellion of distant provinces seeking
                    independence, which should be allowed to proceed without interference.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> In

                    province when the rebellion took place in 1884–1885. By Riel's reasoning,
                    therefore, Morton would surely approve and support his undertaking.</p>
            <p>Riel might also have admired what he knew of Morton's personal life. According to
                    contemporaries the invalid senator was devoted to his family and admired in return by them.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Although Riel had not yet married at the time of his contact with Morton, his
                    own feelings for family ties and relationships were always in keeping with the strongest French
                    Catholic traditions. Morton's rise from an orphaned childhood through law study to an
                    influential position in the Republican party—which Riel quite possibly viewed as an
                    ideological political organization—might also have impressed the Métis leader.

                    Riel, Morton might well have embodied personal sacrifice in the best interests of the people.</p>
            <p>Unlike many Canadians of both French and English descent, Riel had a firm understanding of, and
                    appreciation for, the American political system. He apparently had no preconceived prejudice against
                    the "republican" as opposed to a "monarchial" system. The
                    accessibility of the American leaders to the public and the independence offered to each branch of
                    government were to be used as a part of his plan. In his appeal to Grant, Riel suggested that aid
                    given to the Métis cause would be of political value to the Republican party in general
                    and to Grant in particular if he were to try for a third presidential term.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
                    The Métis was undoubtedly aware when he approached Morton that the Indiana senator was a
                    possible contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 1876, and he might well have made
                    the point regarding political capital to Morton also.</p>
            <p>Riel's devotion to the Republican party, as opposed to the Democratic, never wavered. A few
                    years after his meeting with Morton he angered American officials in <placeName>

                    the 1882 campaign. The desire to be politically active was one motivation behind his acquiring <placeName>

                    the Republican leaders that caused Riel to write during his last spring in the area that would
                    become Saskatchewan: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Probably the most influential motivation in Riel's approach to Morton for assistance to the
                    Métis people, however, was the Métis leader's mental state and
                    emotional condition. If Flanagan is correct, Riel could subdue the violent rages that caused him to
                    be institutionalized from 1876 to 1878 if he felt such restraint necessary to convince the
                    disbelieving world that his claims of divine and prophetic mission were valid. A man who could
                    exercise such control would presumedly have little difficulty in believing that his plan to attain
                    American assistance for a newly forming Métis state was sound and that the leader he
                    thought Morton to be would prove a real and valuable ally. In his own mind Riel might easily have
                    pictured Morton as the dynamic "war governor," a man who assumed a semidictatorial
                    position when necessary for the best interests of his state and people, a man of humble origins who
                    rose to a position of leadership in a political party formed on a commitment to free the downtrodden
                    and oppressed, a man whose dedication to the righting of social wrongs had caused him to forego
                    appointments to higher offices, and a loving and adored family man who courageously followed the
                    call of duty despite the difficulties of invalidism. Surely this man could be made to appreciate the
                    necessity and wisdom of Riel's plan. The personal-interview approach failed, in
                    Riel's mind only due to the language barrier, but a man of Morton's character
                    could undoubtedly be persuaded through a small miracle. Riel magnaminously offered to use his powers
                    as a divinely inspired prophet to cure Morton of his affliction. Riel probably thought it
                    understandable that Morton was reluctant to accept, but God brought a sign to the Métis
                    leader when, exactly two years later, on All Saints' Day, 1877, Morton was removed from the
                    earthly scene. Now, Oliver "Pie" Morton was truly the key to the success of Louis
                    "David" Riel, his mission, his people, and his political plans. Through
                    God's help the bodily resurrection of this American leader could be arranged. Then the
                    Roman Catholic leaders, who had doubted and criticized his mission as heretical, would have to
                    accept the truth of his visions and prophecies. Through their belief, all French
                    Canadians—in Quebec, in the West, and in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as well—would understand and accept his leadership. Eventually the entire
                    Catholic church would at last be corrected to conform with his vision. While all this was taking
                    place, the last part of the Morton miracle would occur—the healing of the resurrected
                    senator's paralytic invalidism. Out of gratitude, if not religious devotion, Morton and the
                    American leaders would arrange the <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-079-1-084"/> protection and pressure which
                    the Métis people needed to convince the Canadian and English governments to guarantee
                    Métis rights under the British North American Act. The amount of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> assistance needed would depend, of course, upon how impressed the Anglican and
                    Presbyterian English and Canadian leaders were by Riel's miracles. To Riel all of these
                    assumptions might easily have appeared logical and valid.</p>
            <p>The final tragic clash between the Métis and the Canadian government came at Batoche in
                    May, 1885. Even then, Riel's leadership overruled the more brutal strategies of Gabriel
                    Dumont, which would have been militarily more advantageous to the Métis. Rather than
                    return to exile, Riel surrendered to the Canadian troops. His idealism, his devotion, his faith
                    forced him to reject the idea of a defense based on insanity. The government charged him with high
                    treason. The August trial was a sensation that could have no "good" long range
                    results. When the six-man jury found Riel guilty as charged, they recommended leniency. Judge Hugh
                    Richardson sentenced him to hang, and the sentence was carried out at Regina on November 16, 1885.
                    The Macdonald government's stated reasons for execution were justifiable: the new Dominion
                    must deal firmly with the threat of rebellion. As a part of the Empire, British law would be fairly
                    extended to all.</p>
            <p>Riel was hanged, and two Indian chiefs, Poundmaker and Big Bear, were found guilty on lesser charges
                    and served prison sentences. These punishments were meant to prove for all time that rebellion would
                    not be tolerated by <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. To Riel's followers, and to their relatives in Quebec, it seemed that their
                    leader was dying not because of his actions but because <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="onc">Ontario</region>
                    </placeName> demanded that the execution of Thomas Scott be revenged. The issue remains an
                    unresolved question between the two charter peoples even today.</p>
            <p>Strangely, the very man to whom Riel had addressed a letter of supplication some ten years before his
                    hanging seemingly held views similar to Prime Minister Macdonald's concerning the
                    advisability of dealing firmly with rebellion within one's own nation. Had Morton still
                    lived in 1885 (assumedly naturally rather than by Riel's intercessions) his attitude toward
                    Riel's sentencing might have been disappointing to the Métis leader. On the
                    other hand, if Morton had possessed all the character traits with which Riel possibly endowed him,
                    if his dedication to relieving the struggle of minority groups was <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-079-1-085"/>

            <p>Perhaps some future discovery of additional Morton writings will provide another insight into this
                    unusual situation. It seems likely that, at such a crucial time in the Reconstruction era, Morton
                    paid scant attention to what may have seemed to him an unimportant episode between the half-breeds
                    and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ottawa</settlement>

               <hi rend="i">Indiana Ragtime: A Documentary Album</hi> is a collection of thirty-three rags composed
                    between 1908 and 1929 by Indiana natives or residents. The music has been chosen both to document
                    Indiana's contributions to the ragtime era and to illustrate the variety of ways that
                    ragtime reached the American public. The collection consists of four parts: eight solos (either
                    banjo or piano), nine piano rolls, eight pieces performed by the Indiana University Ragtime
                    Orchestra, and eight band arrangements. The solo renditions range from performances of the published
                    score to improvisational versions, including a stride performance of "Mr. Crump
                    Rag." The band performances show both the influence of ragtime on other American music and
                    the influence of popular music, especially jazz, on ragtime renderings. This microcosmic view of
                    Indiana ragtime, therefore, contributes to cultural history far beyond the banks of the <placeName>

            <p>The set would be valuable for the music alone, but it is made invaluable by a companion booklet
                    comprised of three sections. The first part sets Indiana ragtime within the context of "The
                    Ragtime Era" (1897–1920). It describes the sociocultural trends that combined to
                    promote ragtime's popularity at the turn of the century, including white acceptance of
                    blacks performing popular music; coon shows and vaudeville; municipal bands; dance contests,
                    especially the ragtime-related cakewalk; the parlor pianos of an expanding middle class; player
                    pianos, phonograph records, and gramophone cylinders; and a "golden age of local and
                    regional music publishing" (p. 5). The second section describes the composers, providing
                    short biographical sketches of the fifteen men and three women whose work is represented in this
                    album. For the most part Indiana's ragtime composers were "ordinary
                    people" with conventional musical training and unconventional interests. Only Hoagy
                    Carmichael and J. Russel Robinson are widely known, even among students of American popular music;
                    but all of Indiana's ragtimers composed first-rate music. The third and largest section of
                    the booklet is therefore devoted to a description and analysis of the music itself. Details of
                    composition and publication, a description of musical strains, and (in the solo and band sections) a
                    sketch of the performers are given for each piece. All three <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-079-1-087"/>
                    sections are illustrated with turn-of-the-century photographs and color reproductions of sheet music
                    covers. The booklet concludes with short but judicious bibliographies of the ragtime era, ragtime
                    and jazz, Indiana ragtime, and music folios. The result is a booklet that serves as an introductory
                    theme, arousing interest in both the music and the history of Indiana ragtime.</p>
            <p>The collection is so good that one wishes Hasse and Gillis had been even more ambitious in using
                    Indiana ragtime as an independent case study of American ragtime. For example, as the dates of
                    publication suggest, Indiana ragtimers were not pioneers but began to write only as rags gained
                    wider public acceptance. Would it be possible, therefore, to use Indiana as a test case for the
                    "domestication" of a black musical form? Could this expand knowledge of race
                    relations during the ragtime era? The authors note that "ironically, at the very time when
                    blacks were prevented from moving into the mainstream of society, ragtime represented the full
                    emergence into American society of a vital Afro-American tradition" (p. 7). They do not,
                    however, explore the irony, as Brooke Baldwin does for "The Cake Walk: A Study in
                    Stereotype and Reality" in a recent <hi rend="i">Journal of Social History</hi> (Winter,
                    1981) article. This omission should not detract unduly from an impressive achievement: a collection,
                    description, and analysis of Indiana ragtime that will be useful to cultural historians and
                    attractive to the general public. One only hopes that other state and local historical societies
                    will follow the Indiana Historical Society in similar ventures.</p>

            <p>This volume consists of six papers originally prepared for a 1981 Indiana Bicentennial Symposium. The
                    essays are concerned with transportation in the Old Northwest before the Civil War, and they provide
                    both descriptive and interpretive accounts of canals, steamboats, and railroads.</p>
            <p>Harry N. Scheiber's lead essay offers the most innovative approach as he attempts to unravel
                    the significant legal and political issues surrounding the building of a national transportation
                    system. He observes that the major issues, such as the <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-079-1-088"/> question
                    of federal and state government involvement, were usually resolved in legislative bodies rather than
                    in the courts. Scheiber, moreover, disagrees with many historians who feel that opposition to
                    federal sponsorship emanated from sectional or state interests. He argues that senators and
                    congressmen had legitimate ideological opposition to increasing the power of the central government
                    through establishment of a transportation system.</p>
            <p>Unlike Scheiber's highly original essay, Douglas Clanin's paper recounts the basic
                    history of the internal improvements question in national politics from the end of the War of 1812
                    to Andrew Jackson's Maysville Road veto. Clanin follows closely Frederick Jackson
                    Turner's observations that sectional interests prevented the development of a national
                    system of transportation.</p>
            <p>In the next essay Donald T. Zimmer provides a geographic and historical tour of the <geogName>Ohio
                        River</geogName> and stresses its role in moving population and goods during the early republic.
                    Zimmer organizes his essay around the development of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, which grew and prospered with the steamboat in the 1820s and 1830s but then
                    declined with the emergence of the railroad in the 1850s. The author also gives the reader useful
                    information about the hazards of river travel, such as sandbars and snags, and about the evolution
                    of river craft, such as keelboats and steamboats.</p>
            <p>The next two essays explore the role of canals. Ronald E. Shaw examines the evolution of canal
                    systems in the various states of the Old Northwest and draws several valuable comparisons. He points
                    out that the canals never represented either a state or national system of transportation because
                    local political interests, rather than economic factors, determined the number of canals and their
                    routes. Shaw also reminds us of the importance of canal builders, such as Jesse Williams, who, with
                    limited formal training, accomplished truly remarkable engineering feats. Ralph D. Gray's
                    essay analyzes the history of Indiana's canal system with particular reference to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Canal. Gray has important observations on why Indiana boosters chose to build canals in
                    1836 even though railroad technology was already on the horizon. He explains that railroads were
                    unproven and far more expensive. Canals, moreover, were very attractive to westerners since they
                    could be used by anyone able to drop a boat in the water. While admitting that Indiana's
                    internal improvements were dominated by local interests and overbuilt, he argues that many <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-079-1-089"/> canals, particularly the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, were essential to the state's economic growth.</p>
            <p>The volume's final essay by John F. Stover is a statistical and descriptive account of
                    railroad building in the Old Northwest.</p>
            <p>Although this book adequately summarizes historical knowledge about internal improvements in the Old
                    Northwest and in several places suggests new research directions, no comprehensive picture of
                    transportation emerges. Even though the symposium was never intended to present a definitive view of
                    early transportation, the book would have benefited from more than the single essay on railroads, a
                    paper describing the toll road system, and an analysis of travel by foot and horseback, which were
                    important, though neglected, parts of the transportation network. Despite these minor criticisms,
                    this book is an informative and well-written introduction to the transportation history of the Old
                    Northwest.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The American Small Town: Twentieth–Century Place Images.</hi> By John A.
                    Jakle. (Hamden, Conn.: Archon Books, 1982. Pp. 195. Illustrations, maps, notes, bibliography, index.
                    $25.00.)</head>
            <p>Deceptively simple and appealing, the small town has attracted an array of writers purporting to
                    gauge its heartbeat and assess its soul. American fiction of the early twentieth century often
                    treated the small town not simply as a stage but as an essential part of character and plot
                    development. Midwestern writers, including Hoosiers Booth Tarkington and Meredith Nicholson, were
                    especially inclined to write about small towns, often infusing them with bucolic qualities. More
                    recently, social scientists have analytically dissected small-town life and institutions, while
                    historians such as Lewis Atherton, Page Smith, and Richard Lingeman have attempted to describe their
                    central features and explain how they changed. John A. Jakle makes good use of all this work and
                    adds to it from two important sources. He draws meaning from photographs of small-town scenes,
                    particularly snapshots and postcard photographs, which appear on nearly every page and are
                    integrated skillfully with the text; and he uses his geographer's perspective to focus his
                    analysis on the image of small towns as places. The combination of photographic evidence and <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-079-1-090"/> a geographer's eye makes this book an important
                    contribution to the literature of small-town America.</p>
            <p>Jakle studies towns of between 5,000 and 10,000 residents in the period 1900–1960, with
                    particular emphasis on the Midwest. In the first six chapters the author considers commerce,
                    society, and public and private life in the period before the automobile. Jakle asserts a strong
                    sense of community as evident in attachments to images of Main Street, with its opera house, bank,
                    saloon, barbershop, lodge hall, and hotel, and to images of the courthouse, railroad depot, and
                    family home. All, as his illustrations so poignantly show, were symbols and icons of small-town
                    America, constituting the images of place that reflected a sense of community, an inwardness and a
                    centralization of social relationships. With the arrival of the automobile the landscape changed.
                    Main Street as a space for pedestrians became a space for automobiles, and the major highway through
                    the town spread business and other activities away from the few blocks near the courthouse. In this
                    and other ways the automobile changed the landscape: the sense of community declined, as individual
                    self-interest and an apeing of big city ways came to dominate and to be reflected in the landscape.</p>
            <p>Like most good books, Jakle's raises many questions and some doubts. Community historians
                    will wish that the work of such scholars as Robert Wiebe and Thomas Bender had figured in his
                    approach, for their studies of community suggest different ways of thinking about community
                    "breakdown" and a different timing of change. Certainly Jakle overstates the role
                    of the automobile in the changes he postulates, in part because these changes were underway prior to
                    1920 and even 1900. Jakle also tends toward sweeping generalizations not supported by his evidence.
                    He particularly eschews statistical evidence and analysis, sticking closely to symbols rather than
                    realities, and it is mildly disappointing that so many of his excellent photographs and captions do
                    not identify the towns pictured. But the strengths of this book are many, and they are impressive.
                    No one should write, give a lecture, mount a museum exhibit, collect source materials, or undertake
                    an oral hsitory project about small towns before reading this book. For the Midwest especially,
                    where the small town flourished, Jakle's photographs and geographer's insights
                    have made a major contribution to twentieth-century community history.</p>

            <p>Historians interested in the lives of ordinary people will find an abundance of material in the
                    letters and diaries of late-nineteenth-century midwestern women who are quoted and analyzed by
                    Elizabeth Hampsten in <hi rend="i">Read This Only to Yourself.</hi> Passages from letters written by
                    women over a long period of time enable the reader to trace the life experiences of rural women in
                    their own words. Hampsten, who collected all of her sources in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ndu">North Dakota</country>
                    </placeName>, contends that these writings are representative of women throughout rural America, not
                    only because correspondents came from other parts of the country but, more importantly, because
                    regionalism is not a significant factor in the writings of women. Male writers are often preoccupied
                    with the politics and topography of their regions, but the women Hampsten presents limit their
                    concerns to their homes and the health and activities of themselves, their families, friends, and
                    neighbors. Although the absence of regionalism in women's writings is confirmed by the
                    examples Hampsten provides, this remains a provocative thesis that will require further testing.</p>
            <p>Hampsten demonstrates that social class, unlike region, does influence the manner in which women
                    write. Correspondence in <hi rend="i">Read This Only to Yourself</hi> reveals differences between
                    the unaffected conversational tone of rural working women and the more self-conscious and sometimes
                    figurative language of more prosperous writers. Hampsten's working women include not only
                    those who worked for wages but also those whose days were taken up with the myriad chores that
                    "indirectly supplement family income by drastically reducing expenditures" (p.
                    50). These working women wrote "in order to assert a pattern and to blurr distinctions
                    between recurring and unique events" because "keeping the pattern intact day after
                    day" was "a mark of a well-regulated and successful life" (p. 68). In
                    words that were written "to create substitutes for their own voices," Hampsten
                    detects a clear sense of self-assurance (p. 95). "Through it all women are not particularly
                    cheerful, but neither are they helpless. What they are is sure of themselves" (p. 89).
                    These women did not refer to themselves as pioneers, for they "were less strangers to a new
                    land than familiars to a condition of living" (p. 89).</p>
            <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-079-1-092"/>
            <p>Hampsten's fourth and most important chapter, "‘Don't Read
                    Aloud’: Class and Sexuality, Disease, and Death in Women's Writings"
                    provides further evidence to refute the stereotype of Victorian sexual prudery. Their lack of
                    knowledge about their bodies frustrated and angered these rural women as they sought to gain some
                    measure of control over their reproductive systems. Letters contain both subtle hints and explicit
                    instructions on birth control. Women who frequently encountered gruesome illnesses and deaths in
                    their communities and families did not shy away from the grim details in their accounts. Since many
                    of the letters cited were primarily obituary listings, one has the impression that mortality rates
                    in late-nineteenth-century <placeName>
                        <country reg="ndu">North Dakota</country>
                    </placeName> were very high. Failure to include any demographic statistics for the state for the
                    period covered in the study makes it difficult to judge whether or not that impression is accurate
                    or to compare this region to others. Hampsten did not intend to write a social history of pioneer
                    life in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ndu">North Dakota</country>
                    </placeName>, but there are places in the book where more information on the social, economic, and
                    historical context would enhance the value of the letters and diaries.</p>
            <p>The two chapters in which Hampsten presents detailed accounts of three specific women and those
                    around them constitute the least successful part of the book. Hampsten apparently felt that she had
                    found some potentially rich manuscript collections, but she reproduced these materials without
                    integrating them into the rest of the book. These three case studies were not as illuminating as
                    Hampsten suggests, and information from the two chapters could have been included in earlier
                    discussions. Despite problems with these chapters, the book contributes to knowledge of rural life
                    in the nineteenth century by allowing previously invisible women to address a twentieth-century
                    audience.</p>

                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> Papers Project was conceived "with an assumption that our work served the
                    interests of a wide audience… concerned about identification and explanation of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s role in the local setting as well as on the national and international
                    scenes…. We aimed to illuminate that history, <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-079-1-093"/> not
                    merely the life of the individual" (p. iii). To accomplish this goal the editors planned to
                    include in their entirety all but certain formal documents, which would be summarized, and other
                    papers of a routine nature, which would be noted by title entries.</p>

                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> became more prominent, however, his papers became more voluminous, and the editors
                    wisely decided to relegate more and more of them to the realm of summaries or notations. For the
                    early months of 1827 these summaries are grouped under four headings: Instructions and Dispatches;
                    Miscellaneous Letters; Diplomatic Notes; and Applications, Recommendations. From April on, items
                    that fit the latter category have been omitted. Despite the trimming, this volume is still an
                    unwieldy 1,400 pages in length, three hundred pages longer than any earlier volume.</p>
            <p>Though the editors worked largely from photocopies, the locations of the original documents are
                    carefully noted. Extensive footnotes serve to identify <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s correspondents and persons named in letters, to clarify obscure events that
                    were alluded to, and to provide supplemental information to enhance the understanding of
                    today's readers. The compilers are to be commended for the absence of editorial comment.</p>
            <p>The forty-two-page index reveals that during his third year as secretary of state <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> had considerable correspondence with or about such persons as John Quincy Adams, James
                    Barbour, Simón Bolívar, James Buchanan, George Canning, DeWitt Clinton, Albert
                    Gallatin, Andrew Jackson, Richard Rush, John Sergeant, and Martin Van Buren. Frequently listed
                    topics are Administration Party, Bank of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Congress of Panama, Federalist Party, and Jackson Party. Though the index also
                    includes William Hendricks, Jonathan Jennings, James Noble, and a few others from Indiana, there is
                    little in this volume that will be uniquely useful to Indiana historians.</p>
            <p>Volume six is the first to appear since 1973, and it is a welcome addition to this very important
                    series, a source which no student of the period can afford to ignore. James F. Hopkins and Mary W.M.
                    Hargreaves served as editors and successively as directors of the <placeName>

            <p>Joseph John Parot has written a fascinating account of a major ethnic group and its assimilation into
                    the Catholic church of a major American city before World War I. To the author the central issue is
                    the way in which Polish immigrants struggled to maintain their ethnic heritage when faced with the
                    force of Catholic universality identified with an Irish- or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName>-American hierarchy. Parot delves into the role played by the Reverend Vincent Barzynski
                    and other Resurrectionist priests, who staffed or approved appointments to all Polish parishes and
                    defended immigrant interests. Dislike of Resurrectionist dominance and personality conflicts
                    contributed to the only permanent schism in American Catholic history, the Polish National Church.
                    Finally, Parot relates events resulting in the consecration of the first Polish-American bishop,
                    Paul Rhode, and discusses the effects of World War I, the reestablishment of <placeName>
                        <country reg="pl">Poland</country>
                    </placeName>, and the strong-willed Archbishop George Mundelein on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Poles. The study concludes that the national parish phenomenon (worship by
                    ethnic origin) preserved the faith of the immigrant and that religious orders such as the
                    Resurrectionists were indispensable in bridging the gap between the institutional church and the
                    foreign adherent.</p>
            <p>Parot is weakest when providing historical background and data on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Poles. He tends to accept Oskar Halecki's nationalistic
                    interpretation of the Polish partitions and Oscar Handlin's romanticization of the
                    immigrant. He explains the <hi rend="i">szlachta-chlopi</hi> rift in <placeName>
                        <country reg="pl">Poland</country>
                    </placeName> but does not directly relate it to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> situation. Why did Poles continue to create a religious problem by coming to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in such great numbers? How did Polish spiritual practices contrast with those of other
                    Catholics? Were national churches actually regionally based, i.e., composed of those from the same
                    town or district in the old country? Did the Resurrectionists gloss over regional differences to
                    strengthen their hand in dealing with the chancery? Were parish societies really family affairs, and
                    how did they function in the national parish? Answers may have to await Parot's sequel on
                    the social development of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Poles.</p>
            <p>Religious and ethnic historians will admire this study for its succinct factual reporting and
                    impressive bibliography of <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-079-1-095"/> manuscript and published sources.
                    Indiana readers will seek parallels with Polish religious life in northern Indiana (Parot is from <placeName>

                    Peter d'A. Jones and Melvin G. Holli began several years ago with their collection of
                    essays entitled <hi rend="i">The Ethnic Frontier.</hi> In this new study the editors present eight
                    essays that explore the meanings of cultural pluralism and the "melting pot" over
                    time. The history of America's ethnic groups has been, in large measure, an urban
                    experience. As the major urban center of the nation's heartland, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with its rich diversity of ethnic groups, provides abundant material for study and
                    analysis.</p>
            <p>Seven of the city's ethnic groups are considered: Germans, Italians, Greeks, Jews,
                    Ukranians, Japanese, and Irish. While Germans and native-born Americans outnumbered the Irish, the
                    success of this group warrants the inclusion of two essays. Michael Funchion reviews "Irish <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>" in the late nineteenth century while Paul Green examines the twentieth
                    century's "multiethnic road to machine success" (p. 212). From humble
                    beginnings as laborers digging the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Canal, the "Irish trinity" of priest, policeman, and politician came
                    to positions of power. In his insightful contribution, Green argues convincingly that it took a
                    Bohemian, Anton J. "Tony" Cermak, to bring unity to the Irish Democrats. The
                    result was an Irish-led political machine composed of Poles, Jews, Bohemians, Italians, blacks, and
                    Irish. From 1933, the year of Cermak's assassination, this machine controlled <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> politics through the mayoral administrations of Edward J. Kelly, Martin Kennelly, and
                    Richard J. Daley.</p>
            <p>While the editors have not attempted to present comparative analyses, a number of themes do emerge.
                    One of the most significant patterns in ethnic history is the general improvement <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-079-1-096"/> in economic conditions by groups. This understanding is well documented
                    in the impressive accomplishments of the Greeks, Jews, and Japanese of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The essays by Andrew T. Kopan, Irving Cutler, and Masako M. Osako, respectively,
                    discuss this phenomenon. Of special interest is the latter study, which includes Osako's
                    reflections on the success of Chinese, as well as Japanese, in adapting to the urban environment.
                    The pattern of movement from city to suburb is evident in the Kopan and Cutler contributions and the
                    study of Italians in the suburb of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                        </placeName>
               </hi> helps dispel the myth of monolithic ethnicity. Diversity, tension, and even
                    discord are major features described in the essays by Funchion on the Irish and by Myron Kuropas on
                    the Ukranians. In a revisionist analysis of the impact of World War I on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> culture, Melvin Holli considers the "de-ethnization" of the
                    city's <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> community, which he interprets as a result of the interplay of external events and
                    conflict within the group itself.</p>
            <p>As these essays make clear, ethnic history considers such processes as adjustment, identity, and
                    assimilation. Holli and Jones use a passage from <placeName>
                        <country reg="is">Israel</country>
                    </placeName> Zangwill to describe the melting pot as "an all-around give-and-take by which
                    the final type may be enriched or impoverished" (p. 6). This reviewer's
                    disappointment with the absence of a chapter on Scandinavian-Americans is simply a quibble; this
                    book makes a significant contribution to an understanding of urban life in the Midwest and the
                    nation.</p>

                    </placeName>: Cornell University Press, 1981. Pp. 369. Notes, illustrations, tables, figures,

            <p>In subject, methods, and conclusions <hi rend="i">The Earnest Men</hi> is an important addition to a
                    substantial and sophisticated literature on the Civil War and Reconstruction. Somewhat distinctive
                    in its focus on the Civil War Senate, this volume is an artful blend of traditional and quantitative
                    forms of analysis. While consistently sensitive to idiosyncracies, Bogue carefully illuminates the
                    broader patterns of Republican factionalism and legislative behavior.</p>
            <p>Beginning with a brief, stylish description of each senator, a prosopographical analysis, and a
                    thoughtful consideration of <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-079-1-097"/> Senate structure and procedures,
                    Bogue moves to the difficult task of classifying all Republican senators in this era as radical or
                    moderate. Although nonspecialists may initially cringe at the appearance of indices of disagreement,
                    cluster bloc matrices, and Guttman scales, this reaction should soon be dispelled by the clear
                    explanations and by the judicious and fruitful handling of these statistics. In studying the
                    Thirty-seventh Senate Bogue first identifies eighty-seven roll calls that related to southern
                    issues, presumably the heart of any radical/moderate division. Through clustering and scaling
                    techniques he confirms the existence of these groups and identifies their members. Senators in
                    subsequent sessions are classified in like manner. The analysis reveals that although less important
                    than party conflict, this radical-moderate split was significant (and more so than sectional
                    differences). Second, despite considerable continuity, factional composition did change over time.
                    Third, neither institutional context nor personal background explain much about factional
                    membership.</p>
            <p>In Part II of the volume Bogue describes the substance of disagreement—the debates over
                    168 roll calls that exceeded a minimum level of disagreement. Somewhat predictably, considerable
                    conflict arose over slavery, emancipation, and civil rights, while reconstruction issues sparked
                    passionate but surprisingly brief debate. Also interesting is the factional conflict over subjects
                    rarely considered in this context—courts, loyalty, and Senate self-governance.</p>
            <p>Bogue compensates for over-burdening the reader with descriptions of minor matters (three fourths of
                    all roll calls are reported) with an excellent summary. Radicals, he argues, were somewhat
                    "punitive" (p. 297) toward even loyal southerners, while moderates were
                    "more deeply" racist (p. 299). Radicals emphasized more the federal government and
                    Congress, while moderates esteemed precedent and appealed to the Constitution with an arresting
                    passion. Such attitudes and values, Bogue suggests, fit within a modernization framework, an
                    approach which helps to explain why this division also appeared over nonsouthern issues. This
                    broader context and the excellent model of legislative analysis make this a valuable work not only
                    for period specialists but for a wider audience as well.</p>

            <p>The American Civil War occasioned an intense struggle between the demands of military commanders for
                    press censorship and the equally strong attempts by newspaper reporters and publishers to protect
                    their right to print news from the battlefield. In his study of the strained relationship between
                    the press and General William T. Sherman, John F. Marszalek argues that Sherman believed the
                    Constitution had to be set aside during the course of the Civil War. Sherman insisted that the
                    military had the right to maintain total secrecy; consequently, the First Amendment was invalid in
                    wartime. Any criticism of the war effort aided the enemy, according to Sherman, and newsmen helped
                    the Confederate cause by printing intelligence and criticizing the army and its leaders, thereby
                    lowering military and public morale. Sherman especially hated the reporters who followed his
                    army's movements, referring to them as "a set of dirty newspaper scribblers who
                    have the impudence of Satan" (p. 81). He blamed newspapers for the sectional split that had
                    brought on the war and once threatened to have any reporter found in his camp arrested "as
                    a spy and… tried by a Court Martial and if possible shot or hung" (p. 81).</p>
            <p>Marszalek's book is divided into seven well-organized chapters that cover the historical
                    development of military-newspaper relations; Sherman's civilian life before the Civil War;
                    the early war years; the military occupation of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
               </placeName>; the
                    court-martial of reporter Thomas Knox; Sherman's march through the South; and
                    Sherman's ill-fated "treaty" with Confederate General Joseph Johnston.
                    The weakest chapter in the volume, ironically, covers press relations on Sherman's famous
                    march to the sea. The first 150 pages of the monograph appear to set the stage for a forceful
                    conclusion, but the treatment of the military-press conflict during the march to the sea does not
                    reflect the dramatic nature of the march itself. Sherman had fought his major battles with the press
                    early in the war, and by 1864 neither antagonist seemed to have the inclination for further
                    editorial conflict.</p>
            <p>The sources used for the study are a skillful blend of Sherman's public and private papers,
                    newspaper accounts, diaries, memoirs, letters, and relevant secondary materials. Each chapter is
                    well documented, although some passages, such <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-079-1-099"/> as the discussion
                    of Sherman's alleged "exogenous neurotic depression" (p. 68), are more
                    speculative than substantial. One annoyance is the volume's lack of any illustrations,
                    charts, or maps; they could have made the presentation more graphic.</p>
            <p>Although Marszalek expends much effort trying to establish a "constitutional
                    struggle" framework for the book, he is soon forced to admit that the conflict between
                    Sherman and the press was actually one of personality, not abstract theory. Neither adversary seemed
                    to have a solid understanding of the larger constitutional issues involved in the Civil War that
                    raged around them.</p>
            <p>Just as Sherman and the other military commanders sought to achieve various degrees of press
                    censorship, the Civil War newspaper publishers and their correspondents were equally determined to
                    protect what they considered to be their constitutional guarantees. They battled government
                    restrictions and those military men who tried to enforce them. Since Sherman's antipress
                    activities were so blatant, he was a constant target of intense newspaper criticism. The war within
                    a war exemplified the problems inherent in the universal question of freedom of the press in a
                    democracy at war. Unfortunately for the reader this otherwise perceptive monograph does not offer an
                    adequate understanding of the press during the Civil War years. Too many pages are spent
                    rationalizing the behavior of an obsessed military commander who attempted to instill total
                    censorship over the press, and too few pages are offered to help understand what it meant to be a
                    reporter or a publisher trying to cover the military action of the Civil War.</p>

                    </placeName> ever done. Not only that, it provides a solid methodological model that integrates
                    quantification, oral history, foreign language materials, and major, primary documentary sources in
                    order to illustrate and dissect the complex interrelationship between blacks and white ethnics in
                    the factory neighborhoods they inhabited. The authors are especially <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-079-1-100"/> to be commended for utilizing a comparative framework and for examining
                    working-class life from the point of view, or value system, of their subjects.</p>
            <p>If racial friction was more inadvertent, subdued, and less noticeable in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s boom period, one coinciding with massive Italian and Polish entry into the
                    city, it certainly became more overt and far less accidental during the Depression years and after,
                    when municipal construction ground to a halt. Such is the thesis of "Seven Neighborhoods:
                    Stability and Change, 1930–60," a brilliant and model piece of microhistorical
                    investigation and analysis. The chapter emphasizes that job opportunities, even at the bottom rungs,
                    dried up in the 1930s, especially for blacks, who suffered unemployment rates as high as 43 percent
                    in the <geogName>Lower Hill</geogName> area as late as 1940. Blacks, for the most part, thereafter
                    became a permanent renter class in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in sharp contrast to the stable homeowner Italians and Poles whose neighborhoods were
                    propped up by dozens of homeowners and building-and-loan associations. When housing transactions
                    were conducted, Italians and blacks more often than not moved <hi rend="i">to avoid</hi> each other.</p>
            <p>The Bodnar-Simon-Weber study insists that the process of white ethnic-black adjustment is much more
                    complex than mere population succession. While never denying the persistence of blatant forms of
                    racism and discrimination in jobs and housing in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the authors argue that the white ethnic neighborhood infrastructure and kinship system
                    was more functional in the long run in a toughly competitive industrial city like <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The strength of white ethnic subsocieties, reaching back to primordial immigrant
                    origins, had more to do with blocking black movement upward than did racial hostility.</p>
            <p>With this concept as their focus Bodnar, Weber, and Simon engage in the still fashionable
                    historiographical pursuit of occupational mobility. The authors constantly reiterate, however, that
                    economic mobility is not always an upward-bound process; that <hi rend="i">downward</hi> mobility
                    frequently occurs (especially for blacks); that kinship patterns are a most significant variable in
                    finding jobs in the first place; that the white immigrant community's interlocking
                    associational structure (church-school-fraternal organization-neighborhood business/commerce) gives
                    such groups as the Italians and Poles a head start over blacks; that aside from racism and
                    discrimination in hiring, powerful and neutral economic factors contributed to heady competition
                    between Poles, Italians, and blacks in the workplace, all of whom were crowding each other at the
                        <hi rend="i">bottom</hi> rungs of the <pb n="95" id="VAA4025-079-1-101"/> occupational ladder.
                    Moreover, the race to escape the bottom was directly related to the overall economic health of the
                    entire <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> metropolitan area, a "city building" process over which no ethnic or
                    racial group, either individually or collectively, had control.</p>
            <p>Is there anyone out there who might like to apply the Bodnar-Simon-Weber model to northwest Indiana,

            <p>The title of this collection of essays is somewhat misleading. It implies a comprehensive treatment
                    of all the lesser-known tribes of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>. The slim volume actually provides several brief articles focusing on seven
                    tribes—the Nez Percés, Potawatomis, Peorias, Poncas, Otoes, Modocs, and
                    Wyandots—that were relocated in Indian Territory. Editor Robert E. Smith explains that
                    the essays "are an attempt to present case studies of representative tribes in the hope
                    that they will stimulate further investigation into the reasons why the Indians came to Indian
                    Territory and what happened to them after they arrived" (p. 7). Smith fails, however, to
                    explain the criteria that make these seven tribes any more representative than some of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>'s other forgotten tribes such as the Senecas, Shawnees, Chippewas, or Ottawas.</p>

                    of Native American history. It should be especially helpful to students of Indiana history who would
                    like to investigate the fate of the Wyandots, Potawatomis, and Peorias after they migrated westward
                    from their original homes in the Old Northwest. The book picks up the history of the seven tribes
                    where most historians have left off—when the Indians are placed on reservations. It shows
                    how the federal government often neglected to provide promised aid to the tribes, and it details how
                    the reservation experience frequently drained the Indians' physical and spiritual strength.</p>

            <p>Stephen Meyer III has provided the first intensive study of the Progressive Era labor policies of the
                    Ford Motor Company since the investigations of Allan Nevins thirty years ago. Inspired by the
                    writings of contemporary labor historians, Meyer focuses on the interplay between the
                    company's drive to make the labor force more productive and profitable and the resistance
                    of many workers to the company's efforts. Drawing upon sources in the Ford Archives and
                    contemporary periodicals, he significantly expands upon and corrects earlier accounts of this famed
                    experiment.</p>
            <p>Faced with an exploding demand for the Model T and a shortage of costly, skilled labor, Ford
                    engineers devised a series of manufacturing innovations, culminating in the moving assembly line,
                    that increased production and allowed the company to expand employment of unskilled, mainly
                    immigrant, workers engaged in repetitious, quickly learned tasks. In 1914 excessive turnover,
                    absenteeism, and other expressions of dissatisfaction prompted the company to launch the Five Dollar
                    Day, which offered to qualified workers wages nearly double those then current in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Qualification depended upon meeting a set of paternalistic standards established by
                    the company's Sociological Department. Investigators fanned out through the city, calling
                    at worker's homes to corroborate statements about marital status, living conditions,
                    savings, debts, recreation, and personal habits. The Five Dollar Day tried to transform workers into
                    cooperative, efficient, docile <pb n="97" id="VAA4025-079-1-103"/> operatives. The company also
                    insisted upon the "Americanization" of immigrant workers; in particular they were
                    required to learn English. The Ford English School's graduation pageant, in which
                    immigrants dressed in native costume descended into a "melting pot" and emerged in
                    American dress and waving the American flag, was a remarkable spectacle for that or any other time.
                    Eventually Ford abandoned its ambitious program. Many workers resented the company's prying
                    into their lives, and World War I disrupted the labor market. Continuing worker militancy convinced
                    officials that paternalism had failed. Labor spies, repression, and ultimately the brutality of the
                    Ford Service Department were the company's new response.</p>
            <p>Despite the paucity of sources emanating directly from workers, Meyer has produced a well-researched
                    account. Some may find an overemphasis on cultural at the expense of economic explanations of
                    behavior. Absenteeism, as Meyer's own evidence suggests, stemmed from the availability of
                    jobs in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s expanding economy as well as from the peasant or premodern origins of the
                    work force. Nevertheless, this is a detailed, convincing, and needed account of an important and
                    fascinating episode in American industrial and labor history.</p>

            <p>If you are a history teacher able to admit that local history is academically respectable, not afraid
                    of abandoning familiar textbooks, and willing to work as hard as students with non-traditional
                    sources, rejoice! This book is for you. All other teachers should ignore this manual of practical
                    suggestions.</p>
            <p>Metcalf and Downey have taught history for many years in secondary schools and at the University of <placeName>
                        <country reg="cou">Colorado</country>
                    </placeName>, respectively, and have collaborated on several publications dealing with local history
                    and innovative teaching. They have mastered the terrain and write readably and convincingly about
                    it. From their experience comes this analytical catalog of techniques. <hi rend="i">Using Local
                        History</hi> includes sections on such topics as oral interviewing, local economics and
                    politics, family history, material culture, and quantitative data. The authors discuss the merits of
                    each topic, sources available for study, guidelines for <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-079-1-104"/>
                    classroom use, and publications for further reading. Documentation for topics appears in the form of
                    success stories about forays into cemeteries, examinations of old insurance maps, and tours of
                    historic structures. Particularly impressive is the section on public schools as artifacts to study
                    demographic shifts and curricular changes.</p>
            <p>Excitement and intimidation characterize these discussions. It is obvious that these exercises have
                    generated student enthusiasm and have not degenerated into antiquarianism, family worship, and
                    provincialism. It is equally obvious that much hard work is involved in preparing and supervising
                    such class projects.</p>
            <p>Generally the authors are successful, largely due to their pragmatic approach. When they try to unify
                    their suggestions with a consistent intellectual premise, they are less convincing. They frequently
                    maintain that the study of hometown heritage is not enough in itself, that student projects should
                    ideally produce significant results, and that local information should illuminate national trends.
                    The latter, they assert, "is one of the most important reasons for studying local
                    history" (p. 219). This may be so, but could teachers not be satisfied when a student
                    emerges from class with a heightened appreciation for the past because of an interesting contact
                    with a small part of it? That alone is a victory.</p>
            <p>If this book has a second edition in a few years, as it should, certain revisions should be
                    considered. The authors should give the political section the same focus and practicality as the
                    others. Also, heavy dependence on <placeName>
                        <country reg="cou">Colorado</country>
                    </placeName> for many of the charts and photographs robs the book of a needed universal appeal.
                    Finally, a work which relies on teaching pioneers should cite those pathfinders at the bottom of the
                    page rather than in the back of the book.</p>
            <p>These few criticisms should not diminish the high praise which Metcalf and Downey deserve. Thanks to
                    them there now exists a convenient compendium of ideas previously available only in diffuse
                    pamphlets and articles. This book is a genuine service to enterprising teachers.</p>

            <pb n="99" id="VAA4025-079-1-105"/>
            <p>While he was a professor at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, James Marston Fitch devoted over two decades to the development of a
                    curriculum in historic preservation. This volume represents the culmination of that effort. In <hi rend="i">Historic Preservation</hi> Fitch has summed up his lectures and presented a written
                    synthesis of his extensive knowledge. The work provides an overview of the problems associated with
                    "the curatorial management of the built world," which is Fitch's
                    definition of preservation. In his own words the book offers "a holistic theoretical
                    apparatus for a wise and civilized system of solving" these problems (p. xi). In the volume
                    Fitch delves into the ideological confrontations with preservation, assesses the trends and shifts
                    in concern over comparatively recent years, and points out the urgent needs of the field.</p>
            <p>The major contributions of the book stem from the author's firsthand experience in
                    preservation on a broad, international scale. Presumably he has observed the field everywhere in the
                    world except <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName>. American preservationists are already well acquainted with the history and lessons to
                    be learned from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mount Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Williamsburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Although much valuable information and insight is provided by Fitch's
                    discussion of benchmarks in American preservation, other authors have written extensively on the
                    subject, prominent among them Charles Hosmer. Fitch's exploration of programs abroad will
                    introduce many Americans to hitherto unfamiliar examples of novel approaches to standard problems of
                    the field.</p>
            <p>The perspective that Fitch has gained through study of European programs is particularly valuable.
                    When in his concluding chapter he cites <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cs">Czechoslovakia</country>
                    </placeName> as having the most comprehensive and competent program in the world, this evaluation
                    does not come as a surprise after the numerous examples of remarkable achievements that have been
                    mentioned in the text. The relocation of a fifteenth-century Gothic church in Most, <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cs">Czechoslovakia</country>
                    </placeName>, by moving it intact along two kilometers of railroad tracks, is nothing short of
                    amazing. Two of the most interesting chapters in the book, "Restoration and Maintenance of
                    Historic Landscapes" and "Protection and Interpretation of Sites and
                    Ruins," draw heavily upon the author's experience overseas. Problems that may have
                    been thought to be unique to the American preservation
                    movement—"gentrification," in particular—are demonstrated to
                    be international in scope. Fitch repeatedly cites three European examples that have offered model
                    solutions to the displacement <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-079-1-106"/> of the native populace: Le Marais
                    historic district of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>; <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Split</settlement>,
                    <country>Yugoslavia</country>
               </placeName>; and <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Bologna</settlement>, <country reg="it">Italy</country>
               </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The major drawback of the book is that it is dated. In the sections on technical problems of
                    conservation of buildings, a concluding sentence or two has been added rather transparently to
                    "update" the material. (A check of references reveals cited articles to be from
                    five to ten years old.) Independence Hall is called "the most recent focus of American
                    expertise in restoration" (p. 104), though it was begun in the mid-1960s and completed for
                    the Bicentennial. The American preservation movement grew in exponential proportions during the
                    1970s, and the author does not appear to have kept apace of recent progress.</p>
