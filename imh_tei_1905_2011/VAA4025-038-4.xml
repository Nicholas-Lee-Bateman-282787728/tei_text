            <p>One September afternoon in 1906, the study hall of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> High School, usually presided over by a dignified elderly lady of formidable mien, was
                    being patrolled aimlessly by a quiet-looking, medium-sized man. The first impression upon one
                    thirteen-year-old student was that of a quizzical being with a sunken nose and bright shining dark
                    eyes. As the teacher drifted idly up the aisle and approached the school's popular fat boy
                    from the rear, those "in the know" began to sense excitement. This lad, who found
                    it difficult to exist from one meal to the next without supplementary rations, was, as usual,
                    feeding from his coat pocket. Suddenly he looked up into the face of the law—caught
                    red-handed. All was quiet. The score or more of students nearby held their breath and anticipated
                    the worst. We knew what the woman teacher would do under the circumstances; we could only imagine
                    what a man teacher would do. Then we heard a low question: "Are you eating
                    something?" Finally came the reply, "Candy." "Don't
                    they pass things around at your house?" It took a minute for the idea to penetrate. When a
                    handful of jelly beans was produced, the teacher, with a twinkle in his eye, said, "Thank
                    you," and walked on about his business eating them.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Within a few
                    minutes after that study period was over the news of the event had penetrated to the ends of the
                    building. An hour or so later this same man reappeared in charge of our ancient history class. A
                    short way down the roll he paused at the same Barney and said, "I used to have a horse
                    named Barney. He wasn't worth a durn." A revolution and a revelation had taken
                    place before <list type="footnotes">

                            by a sense of guilt." Otherwise the evidence is in substantial agreement.</item>

                    <pb n="338" id="VAA4025-038-4-008"/> our eyes. It was not to end for three years, in our minds not
                    ever.</p>
            <p>Shortly the ancient history classes were finding Greek and Roman mythology as interesting as G. A.
                    Henty or Horatio Alger, nor was it longer necessary to hide a good book behind the big geography,
                    which in its day covered a multitude of sins. One could read Herodotus, shocking stories and all,
                    boldly, right in the study hall, and claim that one was studying his history lesson. Occasionally
                    this new teacher would take over a Latin class. Then our well worn ablatives and gerunds received
                    but passing notice, and we reveled in Dr. Harold W. Johnson's <hi rend="i">Private Life of
                        the Romans</hi> or constructed a critique of Caesar's <hi rend="i">Gallic Wars.</hi> It
                    had never occurred to us before, of course, that even Julius Caesar might have made a mistake.
                    Cicero we leap-frogged, the class translating a few lines, the teacher reading several pages. After
                    all, we were in a hurry to get at Sallust's <hi rend="i">Cataline.</hi> Certainly one
                    by-product of that year's work was an expanded circulation for <hi rend="i">Collier's</hi>, which was offering <hi rend="i">The World's Greatest
                    Orations</hi> as a bounty. That, in turn, involved forays from Pericles to Chief Logan and William
                    Jennings Bryan. How dead was Latin when we reached Vergil, only to find, under another teacher, that
                    it was a business of counting meters and weighing syllables.</p>
            <p>We found in the interim that this teacher would now and then teach a German class and that an
                    entirely different mythology and lore would be discussed there. Also, that he could squat on his
                    heels and peg a ball faster and flatter to second base than anybody else in school. Though he made
                    little pretense of being an expert in football, the boys could always count on his being present at
                    practice. When track season began he helped measure and time and in class brought up the Olympic
                    games and Greek sports. He even took up a collection and took the school's outstanding
                    runner to the state meet—an unheard-of event. Frequently he recommended poor but able
                    students to Mr. Jake Gimble and other men of means who bet on promising boys' keeping their
                    promises after college. In assemblies we heard fascinating talks on the early history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. We learned that the <hi rend="i">voyageurs</hi> and <hi rend="i">coureurs de bois</hi>
                    performed feats as impossible as did the knights of old and that the strip-field system of the
                    medieval manor had been practiced right in our town— <pb n="339" id="VAA4025-038-4-009"/>
                    we even made trips on Saturdays and Sundays to see if we could find the old balk-lines. Right in the
                    midst of one of these discourses, the speaker would point to a Badollette, a Brouilette, or a Polk
                    and say, "That might have been your great-great-grandfather." Sometimes when James
                    Speed Rogers (later Professor of Biology at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>), who walked five miles to school when the old mare was needed elsewhere, would slip
                    apologetically into his seat, the speaker would stop and say, "James, you have missed a
                    mighty good talk."</p>
            <p>His office as principal, hitherto visited only upon invitation, became a loafing place during the
                    lunch hour and before school. Many a tall tale originated there. Discipline, too, could be
                    dispensed. Minor derelictions received penalties in proportion; for the few serious ones, the
                    penalty was never questioned. The offender knew that the overwhelming power of opinion against him
                    would permit no appeal. For the teachers he served as wailing wall and father confessor, and stood
                    as a bulwark between them and the political powers that were. The dedication of the 1909 <hi rend="i">White and Gold</hi>—"To our beloved principal, Mr. Logan
                    Esarey—our sincere appreciation of his untiring efforts to make our school life pleasant,
                    and to elevate the standard of our Alma Mater"—carried more import than the usual
                    yearbook formula. When, at commencement in McJimsey's Opera House, the principal gave away
                    the graduating class with the parting words, "We are glad that they can go; we are sorry
                    that they must go," there were those of us who had a premonition that the words might also
                    apply to the speaker.</p>
            <p>We were right, for that summer he left us. The next year was in many respects an anti-climax. We did
                    not know that a number of us would again have the good fortune to work with this teacher.</p>

            <p>Despite the fact that his mother said she "found him under a cliff," Logan Esarey
                    was born in a small frame house about three-quarters of a mile up the hill from Branchville, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Perry County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, January 3, 1873. Since he was the sixth child (of nine), the mother often had
                    to park the infant on the kitchen floor and go about her work. On such occasions the youngster would
                    sit, with lugubrious countenance backed by ample lung power, and cry; so his care was <pb n="340" id="VAA4025-038-4-010"/> often delegated to the older children. Care of a two-year-old was not
                    permitted too seriously to interfere with the usual activities. At the swimming hole one would push
                    him in at the narrow end and another pull him out some six feet away at the other side. (A few years
                    later the same boys were swimming the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, commonly called a mile wide, and with a very fair current.)</p>
            <p>At four young Logan started to school at Branchville, which, besides the school, consisted of a
                    general store and a cluster of a dozen or so houses. Keeping two lessons and two classes ahead of
                    his primary group still left a certain amount of time for pinching and hair pulling. Before long the
                    youngster had the reputation of being "the meanest kid in school." Since
                    intelligence tests, standardized achievement tests, and other means of painless avoidance of
                    learning had not yet been invented, the scholars learned to add, multiply, and do cube root via
                    Ray's arithmetic,—to spell, to analyze the sentence, to know some facts of
                    physiology, geography, and history, and to write a good hand. They were confronted with facts, not
                    "proper attitudes"; the burden of proof was upon them. They could not fill in the blank
                    spaces with answers already provided. The quantity of knowledge dispensed was not great, but its
                    quality was good. In addition there were the books at home or those borrowed from neighbors. Just as
                    important was the education derived from woods and fields and the tales told around the fireside and
                    in the store or blacksmith's or cooper's shop: tales of the Indian wars, the
                    Revolution, the Mexican and Civil wars; of hunters and keel boatmen, hound dogs and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The Esareys had come to America, probably from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wlk">Wales</region>
                    </placeName>, some time before the middle of the 18th century. Great-greatgrandfather John Esarey
                    ("John the Hunter," 1744–1828) had served with George Rogers Clark and received
                    a sizeable land grant on a branch of Salt River in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> country. Difficulties with speculators over land titles crowded the pioneer and his
                    family of grown sons and daughters, some married, out of the Elizabethtown neighborhood. They
                    crossed the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> about 1806 and settled in a little valley at the head of Oil Creek, in the present <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Perry County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. In this neighborhood in turn lived Jonathan Davis Esarey
                    (1783–1858), Jesse Clark Esarey (1817–1869), and John Clark Esarey
                    (1841–1924), father of Logan Esarey. Game <pb n="341" id="VAA4025-038-4-011"/> was
                    plentiful along Deer, Poison, Anderson, and Oil creeks; and the great overhanging cliffs interested
                    not only the original settlers, but also later generations of exploring children. Instead of <hi rend="i">Startling Comics</hi> and radio thrillers, there was a rich heritage of
                    hunters' and fighters' tales, often somewhat confused as to principals, but
                    satisfying, nevertheless. There was still plenty of woods left in the 1870's and the
                    children did not have to draw too heavily on their imaginations when they re-enacted these tales.</p>
            <p>Some of the stories might seem fairly pointless to the case-hardened young sophisticates of today;
                    still, if they were told by an expert, one can not be too sure. There was, for instance, the story
                    of the bewitching of Blackstock, the rifle of old John the Hunter. The piece, fired at forty paces,
                    simply refused to kill a standing deer, though the powder exploded and the bullet left the barrel.
                    In disgust the hunter took his cherished piece home and set it in the corner of the cabin, just like
                    any old rifle gun, and said n'ary a word to his wife. Those pioneer wives understood guns
                    and maybe men, too; so after her husband was asleep, she melted down a precious silver coin into a
                    bullet, loaded Blackstock and put it back on the rack. The next day old Blackstock felled the deer
                    the very first time, as she had "oughter done" in the first place.</p>
            <p>On another occasion the hunters kept running into a thing which just sat on stumps and looked at
                    them. It looked like a gorilla, yet it was too big and didn't act like a gorilla. It had a
                    terrible look in its eyes, and was kind of foggy around the edges. It wouldn't kill and it
                    wouldn't scare. Finally, after the hunters quit wasting shot on it, it just gradually eased
                    off into the woods and was never seen again. Perhaps in this case hunter instead of gun was somewhat
                    "pixilated."</p>
            <p>Then there was the story told by Newton Braxton Pollard, cooper and <hi rend="i">raconteur</hi>
                    extraordinary, of the bullfrogs of Reily hole. That these frogs could drag a fence-rail down to the
                    creek and paddle across on one was common knowledge. But one night the hunting houn' dogs
                    hit the trail of something mysterious. You could tell by their voices that it wasn't a coon
                    trail, neither a wildcat, a fox, nor yet a bear. Certainly not a pole cat. They didn't seem
                    to be trying to catch it, but every time they got to where it had hit the ground <pb n="342" id="VAA4025-038-4-012"/> last they just let out a kind of disgusted "Boo!"
                    Finally it treed, and the dogs came back wagging their tails plumb crazylike. When the hunters
                    approached the tree, they could see it by the light of the rising moon—hunched up about
                    like a big Dominicker rooster. Suddenly it jumped clean over the heads of hounds and hunters, hit
                    the ground twice or so, let out a great "Garrumph," and dived into Reily hole a
                    quarter of a mile away.</p>
            <p>Such a story, told in the upland south dialect in a deep, slow, musical voice, and dragged out for
                    the better part of an hour in the telling—there were many of them for the youngsters to
                    hear and pretend to believe.</p>
            <p>John Clark Esarey, after marrying Barbara Ewing, had served about a year in the Union army. Besides
                    their own numerous flock, usually several other children, orphans or otherwise, were housed and fed.
                    All were supposed to do some work, but one surmises that the discipline was not too rigorous, for
                    many a time the father returned from town to find the horses standing fresh behind the plow and the
                    boys all gone fishing. In addition to the farm chores known to boys of today, they learned to use
                    the ax and broadax, the frow and drawing knife, crosscut saw, bucksaw, maul and wedge and cradle.
                    They knew dozens of trees, what the wood was good for, and when to cut them. They could trap and
                    prepare pelts, dress or tan hides, help butcher, and make soft soap and maple syrup. The girls, in
                    addition to the woman's work of milking, churning, and caring for the kitchen garden,
                    helped dry and preserve fruits, knit, spin, and tend the chickens and such.</p>
            <p>For a few years the family lived in an old two-story double-unit cabin of hewn logs and clapboards,
                    about one mile below Branchville; but since it was drafty and cold and the mother was in delicate
                    health, a new house was built farther up the hill. The boys still played in the old house,
                    ostensibly a sort of cooper shop; but actually—since the Esareys were
                    Methodists—they spent many hours there at seven-up, euchre, and pinochle. At least one of
                    them developed card sense which furnished the foundation later of a very sound game of bridge. About
                    the age of ten, young Logan also made his debut on the dancing floor. Despite the efforts of the
                    local midwife to prevent the young boy from going to hell in that particular fashion by dragging him
                    from the floor, he was <pb n="343" id="VAA4025-038-4-013"/> able, due to his mother's
                    intervention, to continue. In time he cavorted agilely and cut many a sharp French Four or flung a
                    high and fancy double and twisted Lord Massey, to the delight of those whose scruples did not forbid
                    dancing.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>They danced all night 'til broad day light</p>

            <p>At the age of sixteen, having finished common school, Logan got a school at German Ridge. Here for
                    three years, 1889–92, he walked three miles, built the fires, swept the floors, and
                    dispensed knowledge for —40 a month. While he was teaching, his small library was
                    enhanced by books sent home by an older brother who had gone to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Danville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Normal. Summers, the baseball team, which was almost a family affair, was an obsessing
                    activity, and bitter local wars were fought.</p>
            <p>In the early autumn of 1892, Logan entered <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Danville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he finished the teachers' and business course in a year. Another year
                    of teaching, then back for the law and scientific course, 1894–1895. At home for a short
                    time in the summer, he borrowed some money on life insurance, and returned for the classic course,
                    which he finished in the summer of 1896. Like most schools of its kind in the period, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Danville</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a poor man's school; it accepted students after completion of common
                    school and tried to offer any course which anyone might want, from common branches up to
                    trigonometry, Greek, and philosophy. From the standpoint of advanced training, degrees, and
                    independent investigation, the faculty would hardly compare with that of the modern college; yet it
                    was strong where the latter is often weak. There was a high proportion of sound and inspiring
                    teachers. Among those always remembered by the young student were Jonathan Rigdon (later president
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Winona</settlement>

                    </placeName>) in grammar, A. J. Kinnaman in mathematics, G. L. Spillman in Latin and Greek, and
                    particularly J. A. Joseph in history—a teacher who was no slave to a text book, but who,
                    "widely read," ranged over the field.</p>
            <p>Much time, but not all, was spent in serious study. At the time of his first arrival Esarey had met
                    on the train one Lewis Turman, and the boys shared a room heated with a wood stove, about a block
                    from the college.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Soon they were <list type="footnotes">

                    more mature in scholarship than most college boys of today, they would be regarded in some respects
                    as strangely naive. On one occasion it developed in discussion that Turman had never seen a drunk
                    man. So his roommate purchased two bottles of beer, picked up some sandwitches and one other boy,
                    and the three took to the woods. There after a few sips Esarey's head began to loll and his
                    eyes to roll. It was a good act and apparently convincing.</p>
            <p>At the college bookstore clerked quiet and attractive Laura (Pearson) Mills, whose family lived in <placeName>

                    declared her independence of spirit by cutting bangs and going to college. That the Esarey-Mills
                    friendship progressed apace is evidenced by the fact that during Christmas vacation, 1895, the one
                    opportunity of the year for visiting home, the young man spent eleven consecutive evenings at the
                    Pearsons' playing dominoes.</p>

                    help save the country from free silver and repudiation. He began his school in January, 1897, and
                    was married in May. In June the county commissioners appointed him county superintendent. The salary
                    was now —100 per month, and by living at home, he was able to pay off the debt, about
                    half college and half typhoid, in little over a year. Thereupon his father took him to Tobinsport to
                    buy seventeen acres of land—something to save for. The parents lived with their son at
                    Tobinsport until 1899, when Logan's family moved to <placeName>

            <p>The next two years were spent in completing the work on the A.B. degree in history at Indiana
                    University. Outstanding in the department at that time were James Albert Woodburn, of pioneer <placeName>

                    </placeName> family; Amos Shartle Hershey in ancient and modern European history, European
                    government, and international law; and Samuel Bannister Harding in European and English history.
                    Probably no other western history department had at that time three peers of these men as combined
                    scholars and teachers. Woodburn, Ph.D., from Johns Hopkins' famous Adams
                    seminar—genial, anecdotal, and precise—hewed closely to politics and the
                    principles of the fathers. Hershey, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Heidelberg training—unmethodical, at times absent-minded, always
                    brilliant in the field of international relations—opened the eyes of even undergraduates
                    to the scholarship and literature of other lands. Dr. Harding, from <placeName>

                    scatter-mindedness—forceful, exacting, a dynamo of energy and an encyclopedia of
                    knowledge. No serious student ever left one of his classes without resolving to storm the bulwarks
                    of historical knowledge and master it all before he came back again.</p>
            <p>Esarey wrote a senior thesis on "The Abolitionists and the Freedom of the Mails,"
                    won the William Jennings Bryan Prize in discussion, and graduated in 1905. At the time of
                    graduation, in addition to a major in history, he had on the record what would now constitute majors
                    in government, English, and possibly language (Latin and German) as well. In his personal library

                    Philosophy was received in June, 1913, and Dr. Esarey was made instructor in history and secretary
                    of the newly-created Indiana Historical Survey. Courses were established in Indiana history and in
                    the development of the American Middle West, the latter being among the first courses of its type in
                    any university. The historian now began the threefold work of teaching, collecting, and writing and
                    editing which was to continue for almost thirty years.</p>
            <p>Although Middle West historians a century earlier had realized the vital importance of the history of
                    the region and of the study of history from the base of the pyramid up, rather than from the apex
                    down, and though Frederick Jackson Turner had won national renown by developing the latter idea in
                    the 1890's, relatively little had been done during the century. True, the historical
                    societies—notably those of <placeName>

                    </placeName>—had been collecting and publishing volumes of reminiscences, articles by
                    antiquarians, and documents; editors such as Reuben G. Thwaites were adding scores of volumes of
                    documents and travels; and monographs were beginning to come from the seminars of Turner at <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Yet the fact remains that in 1913 there were hardly a half dozen important scholarly
                    works, other than monographs, on the history of the region. Not a state in the Middle West possessed
                    a general, balanced history of itself. There were no scholarly biographies of George Rogers Clark,
                    William Henry Harrison, Abraham Lincoln, Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, Benjamin Harrison,
                    William Tecumseh Sherman, Ulysses S. Grant, Cyrus Hall McCormick, and a dozen others. Of the two
                    histories which bore the name of the region, one (Theodore Roosevelt's <hi rend="i">Winning
                        of the West</hi>) failed to touch the social, economic, cultural, or institutional history of
                    the region, while the other (Burke A. Hindsdale's, <hi rend="i">The Old Northwest</hi>)
                    ended with the organization of the territory in 1787. There were no real histories of agriculture,
                    of transportation, of journalism, of religion, of education, of science, or of folklore. The history
                    of the Middle West was, if not a virgin field, at least an inviting one.</p>
            <p>And of all the states, possibly excepting <placeName>

                    line <pb n="349" id="VAA4025-038-4-019"/> of working officers—Lyman Copeland Draper,
                    Reuben Gold Thwaites, Milo M. Quaife, and Miss Louise P. Kellogg—distinguished writers
                    and editors all, and the finest library of materials on the West in the country. The society by 1913
                    had published twenty volumes of <hi rend="i">Historical Collections</hi> (not to mention
                    Thwaites's seventy-three volumes of <hi rend="i">Jesuit Relations</hi> and twenty-eight
                    volumes of <hi rend="i">Early Western Travels</hi>, published separately) and many volumes of <hi rend="i">Proceedings</hi>, full of articles by scholars. Though <placeName>

                    </placeName> Historical Society also had been relatively moribund, though it had published nineteen

                    But with the advent of Clarence W. Alvord at the University of <placeName>

                    </placeName> Historical Survey was established, a state appropriation was allotted, and soon Alvord,
                    his associates, and graduate students (Solon J. Buck, Theodore Calvin Pease, Arthur C. Cole,
                    Clarence E. Carter, and others) were presenting volumes of collections, special works, and
                    monographs. By 1913 there were nine volumes of the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                        </placeName> Historical Collections</hi>. As for Indiana there were four volumes of <hi rend="i">Publications</hi>, mostly papers and short articles, no documentary collections, and eight
                    volumes of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, then practically expiring.</p>
            <p>The Indiana Historical Survey was modelled after that of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. The idea was to undertake the collecting and publishing of documents, the assembling
                    of materials, and the writing and dissemination of the history of the state. To that end, graduate
                    theses in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history were to be assigned largely in the field of state history.</p>
            <p>Dr. Esarey's problem was not an easy one. Without adequate collections of manuscripts,
                    documents, newspaper files, and all the other material, it was impossible to publish collections,
                    almost impossible to write. Without publication it was hard to arouse interest and get materials.
                    Without interest it was impossible to get money. It was necessary to break out of the circle, to
                    attack on all fronts at once. Since the regular appropriations for the survey usually amounted to
                        <pb n="350" id="VAA4025-038-4-020"/> about —500—enough for a part-time
                    typist and incidentals—obviously, valuable materials could not be purchased. It would
                    have to be beg and borrow, not buy. The prospectus or Appeal for Funds stated the case and plans. It
                    announced a series of studies, collections of territorial papers, messages, and letters of the
                    governors, and other publications, "if the necessary funds are forthcoming." They
                    never were.</p>
            <p>While Ernest V. Shockley was working on his Atlas of Indiana History and compiling the political
                    platforms, Esarey began his Newspaper History and Directory of Indiana.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> When

                    editor. A small but enthusiastic seminar in Indiana history was now at work, and by adding their

                    labor of love. The editor "rustled" circulation and exchanges, kept its accounts,
                    read dozens of contributions quarterly, helped rewrite those accepted, compiled the mailing list,
                    read the proofs, at times even addressed wrappers and tied up the bundles for the mail. Help was
                    used when available—the Esarey family, graduate students, a part-time typist, sometimes
                    an assistant from the department. Proof was read anywhere—on the front porch, under a
                    beech tree in the woods, in army barracks in 1918.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> By arrangement with the

                    annually in exchanges, no regular budgetary provision was made for maintaining the publication. It
                    was always a matter of wrestling with the deficits and overdue bills by requests for special

                    Indiana</hi>.</p>
            <p>The articles in the <hi rend="i">Star</hi> ran more or less regularly for several years and covered
                    every phase of Indiana history. Some were on popular subjects, others almost chronicles; all were
                    sound. Sunday mornings, having read the papers, comics included, the historian would grab a bundle
                    of notes and a long cigar, light almost anywhere, and write his piece for the next week. These
                    articles helped to keep alive interest in the state's history—and they
                    "kept the kids in shoes."</p>
            <p>Although Indiana, the second state of the Northwest Territory, was nearing its hundredth birthday,
                    the state had no scholarly, balanced history of itself. What histories it had were either episodical
                    and popular or else the work of the older literary avocational historians. Best known of the latter
                    type were the works of John Dillon (<hi rend="i">History of Indiana</hi>, published in 1859) and
                    Jacob Piatt Dunn (<hi rend="i">Indiana, A Redemption from Slavery</hi>, which appeared in 1888). The
                    former practically ended with the War of 1812, and the latter with the admission of the state.
                    Dunn's work was built around an indefensible thesis. Neither work covered the more
                    important periods or topics in the history of Indiana.</p>
            <p>Drawing heavily upon his general knowledge and such documents and newspaper files as were available,
                    Dr. Esarey rushed to completion the first volume of his <hi rend="i">History of Indiana (From its

                    but it is a balanced and scholarly history, based upon the sources. All phases of the life of the
                    state are treated—political, military, social, economic, and cultural. There are chapters
                    on constitutions, religion, public lands, banking, and home life. The second volume, although fuller
                    of source references, ran into the practically insolvable problem of presentation which arose from
                    the lack of a central thread to tie to in the later period. The author was well aware of this. He
                    also neglected the opportunity of including an evaluated bibliography of materials for the study of
                    the history of the state; and he, better than any other, was qualified to do this. There were some
                    statements and viewpoints presented which were reversed or considerably modified in the
                    author's mind in later years. At the time of writing he had been through all the important
                    published documents and had laboriously run, page by page, the files of the <hi rend="i">Western

                    newspapers but into diaries, journals, letters, and other sources. Most of these he himself had
                    collected. Dr. Esarey spoke often of completely rewriting the work, but never got around to it. With
                    all its defects it is still the best history of the state and the best one-man history of any of the
                    states of the Old Northwest. All who have written since have drawn heavily from it.</p>
            <p>In 1916 came the state's centennial celebration. The main event was a pageant. William
                    Chauncy Langdon, expert producer of pageants, was imported from the East to provide the scenario;
                    and many hours were spent in consultation with the Indiana historian. Main performances were staged
                    in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. For three days illustrative scenes from the state's history, from French
                    explorers to the day of the automobile, were staged by a large troop of townspeople, faculty, and
                    students. Indians, scouts, pioneer farmers, circuit riders, and politicians got all mixed up with
                    the nymphs, dryads, butterflies, and zephyrs. The unscrambling process was not completed even hours
                    after the last scene. It was quite a show. Esarey was a scout or hunter, for which part he needed
                    little make-up besides coon-skin cap, leggings, rifle gun, and pouch. He had lots of fun approaching
                    the cabin in the clearing and yelling "Hallo-o the <pb n="354" id="VAA4025-038-4-024"/>
                    house!" according to the best frontier etiquette. For months afterward the greeting
                    resounded over the campus.</p>
            <p>By 1918 the university had been turned over to the S.A.T.C. and the war effort.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>I very well remember the heyday of 1918 when the patriots, along with the stay-at-home rangers
                        flooded the campus and almost wrecked the University… and how we broke up the
                        football field and cut down our apple orchard east of the big gymnasium and sowed the whole
                        blooming four or five acres in wheat. How in due course of time we reaped that wheat and hauled
                        it to a threshing machine, and after the turmoil we had about five bushels of Number Two wheat,
                        worth two dollars a bushel, but it had cost us something like twenty dollars.</p>
                    <p>There was then in our midst a most distinguished educator,… who with some assistance,
                        evolved a magnificent dream of a nation wide course in War Aims. We signed up something over one
                        hundred per cent…. every one on the campus regardless, was required to take it [for a
                        year]…. I lectured alternately to one of these classes made up of four companies of
                        S.A.T.C…. I have lectured to that class when a little over three hundred of them were

            <p>When Uncle Sam decided he could use even over-age college professors without technical training as
                    instructors for student army training corps, half a dozen signed up. Among them was Esarey. The
                    military interlude at Camp Sheridan was, by all reports, not too strenuous. On one occasion, when
                    the outfit was lined up for grenade throwing practice, they were ordered to go through the motions
                    but not to throw. There may have been some bets down at the end of the line. Some claimed they did
                    not hear the order. At any rate, several let loose with fine heaves—and so did the
                    officer. From here on accounts vary. Esarey maintained that an innocent look saved the day, though
                    admitting that he threw his grenade farthest. Dr. Clarence May, Indiana University chemistry
                    professor, insisted that they all went on kitchen police, although they were squeezed out after a
                    few hours by other criminals with more recent sentences.</p>
            <p>On another occasion Esarey dropped out from a hike, sat on a stone, and, against orders, lighted a
                    cigar, no one being in sight. When he looked up there was a captain standing right up against him.

                    The work was not absolutely complete; such works seldom are. The editor's idea was that
                    such papers should be made available for use, even though a few documents were still missing. He
                    assembled the items as he insisted the historian had to use them, that is, chronologically,
                    regardless of whether they were written by or to his man, and provided the introductions and
                    explanatory notes. Another two volumes of messages of the early Indiana governors following
                    Hendricks were prepared but not published.</p>
            <p>In 1927, Dr. Esarey resigned the editorship of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>. The immediate and
                    obvious cause was a difference of opinion regarding the statement, "Published with the
                    Cooperation of the Indiana Historical Society," which had appeared on the title pages of
                    the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, and the meaning of that statement. In the argument things got
                    somewhat confused and some University authorities even spoke of "further subsidy [of the
                        <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>] by the Society," depending upon the continuation of the
                    statement. Others almost reached the conclusion that cooperation was impossible, because Dr. Esarey
                    would "not cooperate with anybody." The editor had grown exasperated with the
                    uncertain financial arrangements and what he regarded as the divided control and vascillating
                    policy; so he remained obdurate, as he could on occasion. But the basic cause of Dr.

                    and university, who had the allotting of funds for work in Indiana history, were allotting the funds
                    to one place, while the work was being done in another. As a matter of policy, whatever the reasons,
                    the editor admitted their right to do this. Also, since all his editing work had been carried in
                    addition to a full time university teaching schedule and without compensation, he felt he had a
                    right to sever his connection with it.</p>
            <p>One other factor no doubt had its influence. Dr. Esarey had realized for some years that, due to his
                    editing and writing largely in the field of Indiana history, he had been labelled or
                    "typed" as a local historian. This not only limited the demand for his services,
                    but, far more important in his mind, his reputation as a historian. After all, the Middle West was
                    his field; Indiana was merely his special patch in that field. At any rate he wanted to write the
                    first volume of a projected three volume work on the Old Northwest from earliest times to the Civil
                    War.</p>
            <p>In 1925 he began the unfinished and unpublished manuscript on The Old Northwest to 1815. Lighting
                    right into the middle of things, he began with Braddock's Campaign in 1755 and carried
                    through to about 1790. This period, which entirely antedates the history of Indiana as a state, was
                    his favorite period. Probably no one knew it as intimately as he. Using mainly the published
                    sources—colonial documents, military papers, journals, correspondence of participants,
                    and the accounts of contemporary historians—it was truly a job of
                    "re-search." The work was not intended to be all-inclusive. Where good treatments
                    already existed, the account was minimized. But around certain important topics, such as
                    Braddock's defeat, Pontiac's Conspiracy, the Ordinance of 1787, and the Whisky
                    Insurrection, new presentation and conclusions were built. For the first time it appears that not

                    impact of the French and Indian wars and the War of Independence upon the frontier. That this was
                    total war for its time, that more civilians than soldiers lost their lives, is impressed upon the
                    mind by the sheer weight of the chronicle of the border wars which continued after the
                    "war" had ended. Above all is the emphasis on the viewpoint of the West, of the
                    men who bore the brunt of the struggle, a viewpoint frequently at variance with that of those in
                    power at the time, as well as that of many of our historians. Considerable documentary material has
                    been made available since this manuscript was written, but it changes the picture in no essential

            <p>Although Esarey, like Turner, published relatively little in the field of the history of the Middle
                    West, his contributions were large. In both cases the contributions were largely indirect, that is,
                    through the seminar teaching and the work of their students. Turner, Alvord, Paxson, and Esarey all
                    have their own "intellectual offspring," but their
                    "grandchildren" and even "great-grandchildren" are far more

                    situation which, on the evidence they had, did not make sense. As a historian of the Middle West
                    Esarey will certainly rank among the leading half dozen or so scholars of our day.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

            <p>Impressive and sound as was the work of Dr. Esarey in writing and editing Indiana history, it was
                    equalled if not surpassed in lasting importance by two other cherished labors. Most of what he wrote
                    in Indiana history can, and probably will, be better done within twenty years. But this will be
                    possible largely because of his own collecting and teaching.</p>
            <p>Collecting of materials on Indiana and the Middle West began simultaneously with his writing. In this
                    work Indiana had been almost criminally negligent. Much valuable historical material had gone
                    outside the state into other libraries. Worse still, much had been destroyed after years of storage,
                    simply because no one seemed interested in collecting and preserving it. On more than one occasion
                    Esarey arrived a week or a year after valuable newspaper files or other materials had been burned,
                    given to the Salvation Army for scrap, or used for packing. Separating historical materials of
                    public value from people is often a delicate as well as a fascinating task, particularly so when
                    little or no money is available for purchase. In this work Dr. Esarey had three outstanding assets,
                    one almost peculiarly his own: patience, sincere and unselfish interest in the history, and a
                    personality and appearance which enabled him to establish intimate contacts with and gain the
                    confidence of all classes of people. His was the natural "travelling man's
                    disposition," though he had nothing material to sell. He just liked people. He did not have
                    to "meet" people; they were friends before they spoke. <list type="footnotes">

                     <hi rend="sup">24</hi> It has been the writer's good fortune to have studied with
                            four of these scholars; he knows the others fairly well. Although comparisons are entirely
                            futile, it seems fair to state that Esarey had one advantage over most of them. He was by
                            nature, type, personality, and environment a bit closer to, more in rapport with, the people
                            of the period in which he worked. It is a hard thing to get at. Put it this way: Drop Esarey
                            back into the period 1760–1825, he could with no essential change (often not even
                            of dress) have been accepted outright as a Scout on Bouquet's or Clark's
                            expeditions, as a keel boatman or barger, as a school teacher, small farmer, banker, editor,
                            fence viewer, or member of Congress.</item>

                    newspaper that a hundred-year file of their publication was in a way public property and should be
                    turned over in indefinite loan to the state libraries, even though outsiders might offer thousands
                    of dollars. On the other hand, he could win the confidence of the backwoods farmers, suspicious of
                    "city fellers" with too glib a tongue. Though he spoke not their grammar, he spoke
                    their language; they considered him one of them. In many instances, individuals, whether well-to-do
                    and educated or poor and illiterate, gave their possessions to the man rather than to the Historical
                    Survey, the university, or the state.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> It is impossible to measure the value of
                    such collections in dollars; many items are unique. Suffice it to say that —200,000 would
                    not now duplicate the mid-west Americana added to the Indiana University Library by Esarey. Probably
                    no one in the field since Draper did so much with so little. The library spends now, in a single
                    year, as much as was available for this work over a period of twenty-five years.</p>
            <p>Teaching, like writing or clowning, is an art. It is not something one learns by formula from a book
                    on pedagogy or a teachers' college. No great teacher is ever aware of what
                    "method" he uses. Besides knowledge and scholarship (still <hi rend="i">sine qua
                        nons</hi>, modern educational theory to the contrary notwithstanding), successful teaching is
                    built upon an understanding of people, patience, versatility of interests, graphic and dramatic
                    ability, humor, wit, and common sense. So it was with Esarey. Mix portions of all usable
                    "systems" from Socrates' to the latest psycho-physio-bio-chemic,
                    emphasize the logical, the chronological, and the unlogical, add an inexhaustible supply of graphic
                    illustrations, and compound with equal parts of the man—it cannot be described, it can
                    only be experienced. If any definite features could be picked as outstanding, they would probably be
                    the unconscious Socratic technique—getting the student to develop his mind by pulling one
                    brain muscle against another—and the graphic. The man could come nearer to drawing the
                    picture of an abstraction on the blackboard than any teacher his students had ever known. Such a
                    teacher enjoys teaching, can teach at any level, will always be teaching. Whether <list type="footnotes">

                    on the nature of history, it was all the same to Esarey. He would need no "lesson
                    plan" at his finger tips; the historian would not be certain as to what is the plan of
                    life.</p>
            <p>Although the three "courses" usually taught at Indiana University by Dr. Esarey
                    were pitched at different levels, the underlying goal was ever the same. The Indiana history he
                    regarded as general and cultural. It drew heavily from all types of students. Many took it who never
                    had any other course in history. In every section there were usually three distinct groups:
                    students, possible students, and loafers (athletic and otherwise), who were looking for an easy two
                    hours' credit. The teacher worked on all three; he felt they were equally important. An
                    instance or two may illustrate. Two very prominent athletes were finding the ordinary books quite
                    too formidable opponents. The teacher provided them with a simple but contemporary story-book on
                    pioneer life. The students read it and reported for conference. The first dozen questions he asked
                    were primary. A child could have answered them. But gradually they were led into contradictions;
                    they were caught "swallowing yarns." "Go read it again!" Hours
                    were spent in conference. Several readings were made. A small rudiment of a critical sense was
                    developed; the boys got to the place where they could discard the evidence that razorback hogs and
                    buffalo could climb trees. Another time an innocent young thing, who had identified <hi rend="i">

                    as "ministers of a religious sect on the frontier," was taken through an
                    individual course of instruction on hogs, sheep, chickens, and the like, which looked quite
                    kin-dergartenish to the outsider. But step by step the discussion got around to the tariff, and the
                    student began to realize that this was not (as the instructor had related an old pioneer had
                    thought) a disease of sheep. In both cases the students were quite proud of themselves. They passed
                    the course with as good grades as some better students who had not made similar intellectual efforts
                    on much more advanced problems.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the teacher lectured, quietly, logically, effectively. More often it was informal
                    discussion, background- <pb n="361" id="VAA4025-038-4-031"/> building and thought-provoking. The
                    teacher often took great delight in demolishing his own <hi rend="i">History</hi> when cited by a
                    student in support of some point. He had no faith in text books and wanted his students to be
                    satisfied with nothing less than first-hand evidence. Students were endlessly startled by the
                    teacher's detailed knowledge of their home town, its people and history, their ancestors,
                    and local customs. It was not unusual to hear one say, "Why I've lived next door
                    to that all my life and had to come to college to learn about it."</p>
            <p>In the course on the Middle West a more advanced group presented. Here the students were dumped
                    without ceremony into the vast literature of the subject: published documents, personal records,
                    chormcles of border wars, constitutions, monographs, general histories, historical periodicals, even
                    newspapers. The reading lists were purposely unorganized. It was part of the student's task
                    to learn, under guidance, what was what and how to use it. One of the things the instructor watched
                    for was the beginning of realization on the part of the student that the history of any region or
                    period, however limited, is a body of knowledge far beyond the individual's capacity to
                    comprehend in its entirety. At times the class period would be given to sweeping views of the
                    "stream of history." At others the whole hour would be consumed testing the
                    evidence regarding Major Samuel McCulloch's famous leap down the rocky precipice and into
                    the creek with his rifle and accoutrements (the Indians were after him). Many such problems were
                    never solved. Some students never knew what it was all about; they wanted some definite
                    "information" which they could memorize and hand back on examinations. Frequent
                    brief oral reports on an infinite variety of subjects were a regular part of the program. When a
                    student, allotted fifteen minutes, spent all the time leading up to the subject, the instructor
                    would like as not say, "time is up, Mr. Smith," and then ask the class what the
                    report was about. When no one could guess, Mr. Smith was sometimes slightly embarrassed. As a rule
                    it never happened again to him.</p>
            <p>The course on the Far West was offered in alternate years. Dr. Esarey never pretended to be a
                    specialist in this field, yet so omnivorous was his reading that few had a <pb n="362" id="VAA4025-038-4-032"/> better grasp of the subject, from Spanish explorers to the Grand
                    Coulee. If he had any hobbies in the Far West they were the cow country, cowboys, and the Mormons.
                    If at times irreverent students referred to the course as "cowboy history," there
                    were also times when their lack of preparation on the geography, Indian wars,
                    transportation—to say nothing of cows—made them feel caught off base.</p>
            <p>During the years from 1913 to 1930 when there were regularly half a dozen or so graduate students in
                    the Mid-West seminar, students and instructor worked in the same room, often at the same table.
                    Problems were discussed whenever they came up. No work the instructor was engaged in took precedence
                    over constant interruptions by the students. His patience in listening to the same old jokes which
                    the students discovered in the old newspapers was remarkable. For years he worked at the rusty old
                    print of newspapers by the light of an obsolete yellow bulb eight feet overhead, and made gentle fun
                    of those who had to have a better light. He surrendered in time, however, and got not only a closer
                    lamp, but spectacles as well. In the preparation of theses or studies the student was expected not
                    only to be able to find and use the evidence, but to present it in a correct and readable manner.
                    The instructor had as keen an eye for wandering sentences, dangling participles, and antecedentless
                    pronouns as any English expert. In the early years he was also insistent regarding the use of
                    footnote references and other "scholarly appurtenances." He was never as good a
                    critic of his own writing as of that of others; and in later years he not only became indifferent
                    to, but revolted against, what he called the "paraphernalia of scholarship." The
                    graduate seminar produced, besides those previously mentioned in connection with the Magazine,
                    studies of Indiana counties, educational institutions, roads and railroads, reform movements,
                    constitutions, and many other topics.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>Regardless of what course, period, or region Dr. Esarey was teaching, he was always teaching the
                    methods, processes, and uses of history. Most of his more mature students rated this teaching as his
                        <hi rend="i">forte</hi>, above all others. More or less regularly in the advanced classes,
                    "blue Mondays" were devoted to this subject. An unscheduled seminar met around the

            <p>History was presented in its broadest sense as everything that has ever happened in the life of
                    man—the sum total of human experience; in its narrower sense, as that part of this
                    experience on which we have direct evidence. He emphasized the continuity of history, chronology,
                    and evidence. <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Time is the most stable concept we have, the widest, most definite of concepts. Time is a
                            convention which holds the fabric of history together. An infinite number of things,
                            crossing an infinite number of times, makes an infinite number of events.</p>

                    he had to catch students up before the class for accepting as bona fide a document which was dated

                        <p>Evidence is, in a sense, the foundation of history. Evidence offers the historian more leeway
                            than chronology. He seldom has all the evidence. A case at law is essentially an historic
                            investigation, but there the interested parties <hi rend="i">select</hi> the evidence. This
                            is argument. The historian should merely clarify and present all useful evidence on the case
                            of life, and leave the verdict to the reader. The interpretative historian presents a
                            verdict.</p>

                    one and the same with his concept of democracy. "Take away the one [the

                    can not exist." Merely presenting the evidence did not assure a correct verdict. A critical
                    sense was necessary on the part of the juror. But a critical sense could be developed <list type="footnotes">

                            difficult grounds. In the ordinary meaning of the word, "How" refers to
                            the means used in accomplishing an end and so comes in the field of historical
                            investigation. "Why" is usually understood to refer to the motives in
                            men's minds and these can only be approximated on the basis that men intend to do
                            the things their actions would naturally lead to. This is historical interpretation and
                            never can be settled absolutely by any methods now known to historians.</p>
                        <p>If a theological determination is implied in the "How" and

                    checked with a jerk by those who were seeking to pervert and prostitute history for a purpose. No
                    matter how good the end in view—whether good citizenship, character building, morality,
                    or patriotism—it made no difference. He insisted that history itself is no more moral or
                    immoral than a proposition in mathematics or a biological form, and on those who sought to make it
                    so by some hocus pocus he could vent not gentle satire but blunt ridicule. When a well-meaning
                    preacher sought to add to Lincoln's stature by making of him a great lover as well, the
                    historian wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Lucy [Lincoln's grandmother] is thrown into probable contact with soldiers, she
                            attended probable balls, made probable journeys along probable roads, saw probable sights,
                            held probable amours with probable suitors and finally became the probable mother of a
                            probable daughter by a probable man…. One might question the title of the volume
                            outright—Did Lincoln love all these women or any one of them? He saw his
                            grandmother Sparrow a few times when he was a small child. May never have seen his
                            grandmother Lincoln, certainly not often enough to "love" her much; the
                            girl in the covered wagon was a pipe dream of Lincoln—and he had many; Katie Roby
                            was at a spelling match with Lincoln; Caroline Meeker was present at a trial where Lincoln
                            was a party and perhaps sympathized with him, may even have told him so; Polly Warnick was
                            one of the six daughters of Sheriff William Warnick for whom Lincoln worked as a day
                            laborer. She was of marriageable age at the time—further evidence of love, none.
                            That Lincoln exceeded in filial devotion all other boys born or reared in southern Indiana
                            at that time is a reflection which thousands will resent; that thousands of other children
                            were left orphans at a similar age in early Indiana is a commonplace; that Nancy Hanks was
                            the only "Angel Mother" that ever inhabited southern Indiana is
                            gratuitous; that Abraham Lincoln was more than ordinary as courtier or husband is doubtful.
                            Lincoln was great enough and Indiana glories in his greatness but such balderdash as the

                    "Education as training for life" is perfectly checkmated by the practice of
                    withholding from the pupil anything that isn't "delectable."
                    "Frames of reference" and catechisms are drawn up and the pupils are indoctrinated
                    with the "correct attitude." Teachers are trained on the theory that
                    "content knowledge" is a handicap. History as a content subject, the storebin
                    whence come the facts on which are based not only economics, government, law, and sociology, but
                    life itself, is largely eliminated. And without the facts there can be no thought process, no
                    verdict. Even universities are occasionally told that the intellectual objective is certainly not

                    thinking in government, religion, and education. But he never surrendered the idea that it was the
                    duty of the state, and of the teachers, from primary grades to the university, to accept what pupils
                    or students were the current output of the populus and to do the best by them that was humanly
                    possible. A state university in his <list type="footnotes">

                            before. Beard leaned heavily on Croce, and as for Croce, Esarey's students had had

                    worth the investment at the top levels, for he was not sure at just what level the "natural
                    aristocracy" would break out. As for condemning some, by means of those "terrible
                    weapons, intelligence tests" or otherwise, to become hewers of wood and drawers of water,
                    it was anathema to his democratic soul. He wrote in 1917: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>This was the general theory. In practice Esarey did emphasize the intellectual objective above all
                    others. At times he did recommend frankly to students that they try to be happy horse traders rather
                    than unhappy lawyers or teachers. He believed that the best way to administer most disciplinary
                    cases—absences, "activities," and the like—was by way of the
                    scholastic requirements. And when it came to moral lapses—cheating, lying, or
                    hypocrisy—he could drop a student like a hot coal. He was vastly distrustful of and
                    impatient with anything—administrative topheaviness, too many rules, revolutionary
                    curricular changes, or reforms—which seemed so frequently to lose sight of the main idea.
                    When the university in the 1930's went through the throes of a curriculum revision, he
                    said, "The mountain labors…. " He felt it did not face the major fact,
                    the need of more work of better quality. And again, more recently, when after scores of committee
                    and faculty meetings and two years of effort, the university produced a self-survey report of some
                    thousand pages, he wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            worse, such men are not on the market. It is hard to pick one before he is developed and
                            impossible to buy him after he is developed…. You no doubt have heard of the
                            terrible danger of what they call inbreeding. I merely suggest that along that line, it is
                            barely possible that Indiana men and women, trained in our own institutions may possibly

                            borne by Indiana men, and in that forty years, I think I can safely say that if one were to
                            pick out fifty leading men on the campus, at least fifty of them would be "to the

                    he hoped that war might help us realize how far we had strayed from them. In April, 1942, he gave
                    his last written advice to President Wells of Indiana University: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I don't doubt that you will have endless suggestions for the reform of the
                            University. We have always had these cattle with us, and you are farmer enough to know what
                            happens when they find a gap in the fence. In the thirty years I have been acquainted with
                            the University, I have never known one of these reformers, but what in some way intended to
                            lessen the time required for a student to get through school. Regardless of the fact that
                            scores of new subjects have been put in to enrich the curriculum, many of them in times of
                            stress or distress, all of them have led toward the primrose path. It was a rather long call
                            from calculus to ring around the rosie bush, but in the course of our reforms there, the
                            ring around the rosie bush has been made equal in educative value to Homer or Logic or some
                            such frivolous study of the old days. One would think, looking back over the period and
                            noting just the general features, that attendance at college was a penalty inflicted on a

            <p>Such was the loyal Hoosier's idea of a great mid-western or provincial university as
                    contrasted to the great metropolitan or international university. The power to run such a university
                    he would grant no more to an administrative bureaucracy than to a sectarian, political, or personal
                    clique, but only to the agents of the people, advised by a faculty of responsible teachers and
                    scholars. When, as often happened, great teachers and scholars were not consulted, the state as well
                    as the university lost. There should be no men who were in the university but not of the university.
                    On deans (always his personal friends) his classic comment was, "There are too damned many

                    thread as any around which to organize history. It has to draw upon all history for its being.</p>
            <p>The historian is usually interested in politics; Dr. Esarey, unusually so. Always a serious student
                    of political philosophy, his deepest interest centered in the principles and processes upon which
                    the American republic was founded and operated. His belief in a proper balance between liberty and
                    authority, the states and the nation, and between the different branches of the governments, in a
                    "government of measures not of men," and in the essential dignity of the
                    individual was a deep-seated conviction; it was founded on faith as well as reason. He was a
                    democrat by environment and instinct. He had the frontiersman's penchant for deflating any
                    person who put on airs or assumed importance, whether because of wealth, power, or superior
                    intelligence. Yet he envied not wealth and greatly respected intelligence. That he was never seen in
                    dress clothes, and in academic costume but two or three times in his life, was not due to a personal
                    whim. Like Jefferson and John Adams, he believed that government and society should be run by the
                    "natural aristocrats democratically selected"; and he had faith that, by and large over a
                    period of time, the people had gumption <list type="footnotes">

                    experience in self government behind them. As Jefferson emphasized education and local
                    self-government as the hooks upon which democracy hung, Esarey emphasized <hi rend="i">critical
                        ability and integrity</hi>. The puritan in him revolted at dishonesty and hypocrisy. He often
                    argued about which was more dangerous to representative government, the "honest ignoramus
                    or the intelligent but not hypocritical crook." As between the two evils, he preferred the
                    latter. He came nearer manifesting personal hatred toward those who robbed the people of their

                    dwell so often or speak with such intense seriousness in later years. He often emphasized the point
                    that humor was a critical quality, that as long as the people could "laugh it off"
                    there was still hope for them, in spite of all their derelictions and turpitude. The most brilliant
                    lecture he ever delivered on this subject was unrecorded and unprintable.</p>
            <p>Back in the "era of the red flag—SLOW MEN WORKING," Dr. Esarey
                    contracted for a small WPA outbuilding at his little refuge on <geogName>White River</geogName>. He
                    needed amusement and felt that the project would furnish a quantity for some period of time. As he

                    seminar" from week to week. But he had not foreseen the final effect. When, in due course,
                    the job was finished, and a detailed and intimate set of government instructions was furnished for
                    its use, it was too much. The ensuing discourse was more than satire. It was an annihilating and
                    devastating Philippic. He out-Lincolned Lincoln at his best (or worst) and out-Rileyed Riley. He

                            perfectly the line of progress laid down by Plato for all popular governments. Whether we
                            can extricate the old republic from this mob rule is a grave question. There are very few
                            instances in history where a people have been able to retrace such a fatal trip. It might
                            have been salvaged after '36 and possibly part of it after '40 but by
                            '44 a numerous part of our population will have had no appreciation or experience

                    learned that no single man is indispensable, any time, any place. He disliked very much a cynical

            <p>Many people knew Logan Esarey, not as a historian or teacher, but just as Logan Esarey, a character,
                    a personality. His widest circle of acquaintanceship centered around his activities as humorist at
                    large and in fraternal work. He has been variously referred to as a Hoosier Will Rogers, as an
                    educated Abe Martin, and as an "onery old cuss." If there be such a thing as
                    "marginal uniqueness," he had it; the margin was wide and merged with the whole
                    page. His humor was distinctive yet inseparable from the personality. It was dry, whimsical, shot
                    through with a streak of mis-chievousness, never biting. The characteristic was no doubt inherited
                    but, since it was appreciated, was also cultivated. "Life is a high comedy," said
                    he, "so why not play a part?"</p>
            <p>Some facets of this humor are easily delineated. There was the same knack for using the homely,
                    sometimes salty, metaphor of the Lincoln type. Such allusions came naturally to both. There was the
                    Mark Twain tall tale—but not too tall—strain, also the double-level effect of
                    a Swift or Lewis Car-roll. <list type="footnotes">

                            that the dirty infighting was not all one-sided, as Dr. Esarey frequently inferred (entirely
                            without documentary evidence) that the writer had suffered a similar lapse about twenty

                    there any tendency towards the practical joking dear to the pioneer; but the "wise
                    crack" in its better form was prominent. Permeating all, and most distinctive, was a
                    drollery and whimsicality, which to be effective needs not only a slant of mind but also a cast of
                    countenance.</p>
            <p>Humor of this type comes not from a reservoir, to be drawn from upon occasion; it seeps and trickles,
                    ebbs and flows. Whether the audience be one or a thousand makes no difference; its anticipation in
                    the barber shop is no less keen than at the rise of the toastmaster at the big banquet table or on
                    the lecture platform. When a person approached Esarey he expected something. Maybe he got a squint
                    and a chuckle, and soon both were chuckling—about what, nobody knew. Something outside or
                    inside of them was mildly funny. They might sit and observe a dog. If the dog cocked an eye or
                    frowned, the humorist might begin to speak "Old Dog's" thoughts for him,
                    and they would be plausible thoughts. The conversation might turn to the merits of the weather, what
                    constitutes a cigar, or whether the carp is a fish.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> It would be solemn, the
                    observations profound, and the meaning almost nil. It was the art of small talk without
                    personalities, highly developed. Some went to Esarey, as they expressed it, "to get a lift
                    when feeling low"; others went to sharpen their wits in another round of an argument which had been
                    running for years—yet which no one knew for certain what it was about.</p>
            <p>Esarey's humor is not to be found in his formal writing and only to a degree in his letters
                    and fugitive essays. A few samples only are at hand. In a business letter from <placeName>

            <p>On the margin of the paper of a correspondence student who was copying passages liberally from his
                    textbook (Esarey's <hi rend="i">History of Indiana</hi>) he wrote: "At times you
                    show a very brilliant style. Continue to cultivate this." On entering a. class in the

                    from the beginning that my weakness is whiskey, not women!" When during the same period the
                    rumor got out (he probably started it himself) that he was a Ku Klux Klanner, and negroes
                    disappeared from his classes for several years, he enjoyed it immensely and teased his negro friends
                    about it. In a class in Indiana history he bore down on the Methodists and the Republicans until

                    Purpose: unknown for certain. In the late summer of 1942 an old friend greeted him on the campus,
                    "Hello, Logan,… where you living now?" (He then had two homes, one in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> and one in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>.) "Oh, I hain't got any home, just wander around."
                    "Don't you still live on South Henderson?" "Yes, sometimes, but
                    there's a little red devil, with pitchfork and sharp tail, living over
                    there.—Don't know what we can do about it, unless the government will come over
                    and straighten things out!" The friend at first thought he was losing his grip, but soon
                    found out otherwise.</p>
            <p>As a <hi rend="i">raconteur</hi> Esarey had all the qualifications—deliberation, dialect,
                    the art of mimicry, and the ability to impress the importance of the story. Aside from the earthy
                    stories of the Lincoln type, he never told a story not acceptable to mixed company of the Victorian
                    era. Favorites most often related were of an old timer, who, overcome by excitement, bad liquor, and
                    political oratory in the campaign of 1912, broke up the meeting by rising and yelling, "
                    'Ray fer Ga-a-rfield! 'Ray fer Ga-a-rfield!" Or of old Uncle Jake, well
                    along in years but young in spirit, who went to the doctor for a check-up. Nothing was wrong, but
                    the doctor and the boys, deciding to have fun, told him he would have to lead a calmer life. A bit
                    later, after having been seen looking on at a barn dance, Uncle Jake was called in by the doctor.
                    Examination now revealed a heart palpitation. Further inquiry brought to light the barn dance.
                    "Do ye think that's what causin' it, doc?" "Certain of
                    it." A pause and a bit of calculation, "Well, doc, if you're sartin
                    that's what's causin' it, gawd dammer, jist let 'er
                    palp."</p>
            <p>Around such a person accumulates a volume of anec-dotage of considerable proportions. And most of it
                    is true. One or two examples must suffice for illustration. No one looked neater than Esarey when
                    haircut, shave, and suit-pressing happened to coincide. Perhaps it was the contrast. At other times
                    trousers and coat of heterogeneous color, no tie (or else a shoe-string bow set northwest by
                    southeast), and ten days' growth of beard made it impossible to distinguish him from the
                    laboring man or farmer. One day he dropped in for Rotary lunch at a neighboring town. Seated next to
                    him was a young man in an olive green uniform. <pb n="376" id="VAA4025-038-4-046"/> Esarey inquired
                    whether he was in the army. The young man explained that he was a forester and resettler. Further
                    questions brought out quite a little speech on the nature and importance of his work in
                    rehabilitating southern Indiana. Esarey manifested a naive interest and implied that he would like
                    to have such a job. Whereupon the young man explained that one would have to be a college graduate,
                    be able to handle much paper work, as well as people, and know a lot about trees; in general he
                    deprecated the prospects of a plain farmer's making the grade. Then without previous
                    warning Esarey was called to the speakers' table. There he repeated his conversation with
                    "that young squirt," asked him a lot of questions about Indiana trees, their
                    habits and uses, explained how many trees he had cut down and worked up before the young man had
                    even had a diaper, and admonished him in general about the immorality as well as the futility of
                    trying to educate the hillbillies of southern Indiana in the Tugwell idea. For forty minutes he
                    entertained the group in the true after-dinner style of which he was master. At the end the young
                    man came up, laughingly shook hands, and said, "You sure had me fooled."</p>
            <p>During the early years of the depression, when university salaries were cut and an appropriation
                    reduction was feared, university speakers at Foundation Day meetings over the state were expected to
                    emphasize the direness of the situation. Those in charge in a certain town drew Dr. Esarey. Quite a
                    build-up followed and a respectable crowd assembled. When the speaker appeared it was in
                    mud-splattered leggings, a more or less out-at-the-elbows coat, and other articles in keeping. He
                    talked of starving Armenians and Hindus, of American humanitarian instincts and generosity. Then he
                    brought the picture closer home—told of starving Hoosiers right under our
                    eyes—good, honest, upright, moral, hardworking college professors at the state
                    university. It was a sad and doleful picture that he described. According to one report, those in
                    charge were apologizing and explaining for weeks. There was probably no necessity for this. Esarey
                    seldom misjudged his audience—certainly not a Hoosier audience. Likely the audience knew
                    someone's leg was being pulled—and whose leg it was.</p>
            <p>Esarey enjoyed the friendliness and informality of Rotary. If at times he got his motto confused and
                    solemnly <pb n="377" id="VAA4025-038-4-047"/> announced that "He serves best who profits
                    most," it was all in fun. His interest in Masonry, however, was much more than social. The
                    principles of Masonry were his religion. He often called himself "a doubting Methodist, an
                    unregenerate Republican, and a Mason." For years he was a faithful worker in the order and
                    a student of Masonry. Here, too, he was probably the teacher, also. He worked regularly with the
                    Eastern Star and, on the outside, with many young men studying for their degrees and offices. For
                    years he was not only the fraternal faculty sponsor of the Acacia chapter on the campus, but father,
                    step-father, and even "Dutch Uncle" to the boys. In his mind a Mason, like
                    Caesar's wife, had to be beyond suspicion. In 1932, the year of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> bicentennial celebration, Esarey was much in demand with his speech on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Masonry, and, despite the fact that that was one of his years of bad health, he
                    spared not himself, but travelled from the Appalachians to the Rockies. He was a thirty-second
                    degree Mason. Masonry played a far more important part in Esarey's life than is here
                    indicated, but it is a chapter which cannot well be covered in a general sketch.</p>
            <p>In addition to his fraternal interests Dr. Esarey had the usual number of side interests. Reading, of
                    course, is hard to separate into work and pleasure units, particularly in a historian's
                    life. Classics were ever at hand and, unlike most, he renewed old acquaintances by regular though
                    sketchy rereading. Historical fiction, especially with American settings, he read in quantity.
                    Modern novels and detective stories did not interest him, though he often sampled the
                    "pulp" magazines for their portrayal of the Far West. Newspapers and periodicals
                    of all types were one of the main props of his current as well as historical knowledge.</p>
            <p>Up to mid-life, college sports were more than a perfunctory interest. Football, basketball, and track
                    he followed and attended, in part for themselves, in part because some of "his
                    boys" were engaged. But baseball, his first love—professional and
                    amateur—remained to the end. When, with a pocket full of cigars, Esarey sought a sunny or
                    shady seat on the bleachers, kindred souls gravitated around, and the game would be played with
                    suitable comments and contributions.</p>
            <p>Hunting and fishing carried over from youth. Rabbit <pb n="378" id="VAA4025-038-4-048"/> and bird
                    hunting revived when it came time to teach the youngsters. He indulged in a coon hunt now and then
                    when some local friend promised a good one, but his own choice was a fox hunt. Many a night he
                    travelled the hills to listen to the music of hound dogs—a music with which no other can
                    compete in the minds of some. In the art of Ike Walton, Esarey never advanced so far. It was largely
                    a matter of drowning worms. He always pretended, at least, that trying to catch a tarpon on a light
                    line was silly, when good carp could be had with a piece of clothesline and a sapling.</p>
            <p>In music likewise his tastes were simple. His own output, likely to break out almost any time,
                    consisted of the old hymns. After the radio came, the ballads and "mountain music"
                    of the Saturday night "Grand Old Opery" were the favorite program. The Saturday
                    evening card games and the music went together; it was not a good combination for those who took
                    both their bridge and music seriously. Cards had a double attraction: the game itself and the people
                    who played the game. The older games (euchre, seven-up, etc.) were played with certain friends to
                    the end, but bridge probably ranked first in later life. In this as in some other things, Esarey
                    refused to be bound by too many rules. He had card sense, a fine memory, and a philosophical
                    attitude, and he enjoyed matching his wits with others.</p>
            <p>Family life for the Esareys was simple in its externals. As five children grew up, a system of
                    parental <hi rend="i">laissez faire</hi> prevailed in ordinary things—unless someone got
                    seriously out of bounds. Beyond a grounding in the life of the outdoors and good literature read
                    aloud, the members were encouraged to try out different talents. The household abounded with musical
                    instruments, tennis rackets, ball bats, guns, and what not. There was little coddling; self-reliance
                    was the rule. As the youngsters reached high school age they were given the privileges of the family
                    check book on their own responsibility. No attempt was made to influence choice of careers. The five
                    children received ten college degrees, no two in the same subject. (All told, the Esarey's
                    had almost forty years of regular work at Indiana University.) Others than the immediate family were
                    also helped through college. As the grandchildren came along, their grandfather began to establish
                    in the minds of the third generation the love of the outdoors and the continuity which ran back to
                    their pioneer <pb n="379" id="VAA4025-038-4-049"/> ancestors. Many hours he spent with them in the
                    woods and in the telling of tales. His best single bit of writing is a simple account prepared for
                    his grandchildren of the round-the-calendar activities of young people in the woods two generations
                    ago; under the title "My Indiana Home" it exists in various lengths. It was read
                    to historical groups and used as a manual in C.C.C. camps. It has been described as a prose-poem on
                    Indiana life. He also wrote several shorter essays and recorded a number of tales handed down from
                    the pioneers.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Former students corresponded with their old friend from all over
                    the world. When they came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a personal call was a matter of course. Some of the "boys" became
                    wealthy, famous, important. When they talked to their former teacher, it was inevitably on the old
                    basis—not as master and student, but as minds expecting to give and take.</p>
            <p>The thought naturally arises, how did anyone who so enjoyed people and loafing ever get any work
                    done? (Once, when Esarey left a barber shop, a man who had known him for years remarked,
                    "There goes the biggest loafer in town.") The answer is probably two-fold: the
                    loafing was partly an illusion; and the work was efficient, regular, and unspectacular. Esarey could
                    give the impression of having done a lot of loafing in the six blocks and fifteen minutes between
                    the library and home. For many years he averaged about nine hours a day in the library, in addition
                    to classes and other work. The ordinary social distractions drew but little upon his time; holidays
                    and Sundays were work days too. Then he had the ability to utilize the fragments of time wasted by
                    most. A half hour between a class and a committee meeting might produce the book review or speech
                    outline which he had been mulling over in his mind while "loafing."</p>
            <p>Dr. Esarey's health was never robust; years of work among the dusty newspaper volumes did
                    not help it. By the mid-1920's he was beginning to show the serious effects of pulmonary
                    trouble. He had had some lots in West Palm Beach since <placeName>

                    In 1939 he was forced to discontinue active teaching. He officially retired and became professor

            <p>Logan Esarey was the last of the Hoosier historians. He bridged the gap between the pioneer and the
                    modern. In him the traditions and virtues of an earlier period were deep rooted; of inclinations to
                    adapt to the "new order" there were none. He was historian, teacher, humorist, and
                    friend; individualist, non-conformist, Hoosier. As Mr. Justice Holmes said in 1886: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The power of honor to bind men's lives is not less now than it was in the Middle
                            Ages. Now as then it is the breath of our nostrils; it is that for which we live, for which,
                            if need be, we are willing to die. It is that which makes the man whose gift is the power to
                            gain riches sacrifice health and even life to the pursuit. It is that which makes the
                            scholar feel he cannot afford to be rich.</p>

            <p>It is a familiar fact that Abraham Lincoln spent part of his early life—from 1816 to
                    1830—in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. This period, formative years as they were, partially moulded his
                        viewpoint.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> In still another way Indiana exerted influence on the
                    Emancipator's career. This occurred in 1860, when he was elevated to the Presidency of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. In ascending to this exalted office Lincoln was to have the indispensable help of the
                    state in which he had spent part of his youth. For in this critical year the Hoosier State was to be
                    a vital factor in national affairs.</p>
            <p>Indiana had never been rabidly opposed to slavery. The lower counties, settled originally by people
                    from below the Mason and Dixon line, were so strongly filled with southern sympathies that
                    antislavery work there was discouraging. Free Soil meetings were frequently broken up, and the
                    genuine opponents of slavery had almost come to accept the Compromise of 1850.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    to the dominant proslavery Democratic party were able to unite only on a three-cornered platform
                    taking in antislavery men, prohibitionists, and Know Nothings: "Freedom, Temperance, and

            <p>Nevertheless, Indiana was a political prize for which the anti-Democratic forces were willing to

            <p>When the Presidential year 1860 opened, the opposition (as those combating the Democrats were called)
                    was still divided into three main groups—the Republicans, the
                    "Americans" (Know Nothings), and the remnants of the old Whig party who still
                    declined to believe that Henry Clay's party was all but dead. Cooperation between them was
                    especially difficult because the large German element in the Republican party disliked the
                    "Americans," and the Old Line Whigs feared the radicalism of the Republicans. But
                    one factor was in their favor—the growing schism in the Democratic ranks. The Indiana
                    Democrats, surfeited with success, had begun to quarrel among themselves. Some were disappointed
                    over meager spoils; some were angry at the party autocrat, <placeName>

            <p>Lincoln had some justification for believing that "the whole of Indiana might not be
                    difficult to get." Besides having lived part of his early life in Indiana and having his
                    debates with Stephen A. Douglas in 1858 well received there, he had been cordially welcomed when he
                    spoke at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in September, 1859. More significant, he had much in common with the conservative
                    Indiana "opposition" leaders; like many of them, he had been a Henry Clay Whig.
                    His anti-slavery views were not so strong as to antagonize the abolition-hating elements in the
                    southern counties, who were for Bates. In short, Indiana Republicans could logically support <placeName>

            <p>Indiana's choice narrowed down to Bates or Lincoln. And the determination of the way the
                    state would vote rested primarily with Caleb B. Smith and his friends.</p>
            <p>Smith had served in Congress with Lincoln during the session of 1847–1849. Like Lincoln,
                    he had been a Whig who had finally entered the Republican ranks. Having succeeded in being appointed
                    one of Indiana's four delegates-at-large and chairman of the delegation, Smith decided to

                            opinion gathered strength that Mr. Seward would be nominated on the first or second ballot,
                            and our delegation, while they were divided into those who preferred Mr. Bates, Mr. Lincoln,
                            Mr. Cameron, Mr. Seward and Mr. McLean, were, with two exceptions, unanimously opposed to
                            him, on the grounds of his being the subject of too great prejudice with our people. It was
                            then moved that our delegation vote as a unit for Mr. Lincoln in order to defeat Mr.
                            Seward…. Indiana having no candidate of her own was in a position to make her

                    from former "Americans" and antiforeign conservative Whigs, and was at this time

                    V. Johnson, were welcomed to a great rally at the state's metropolis. Tens of thousands
                    heard Douglas in an open-air demonstration. He blasted the Buchanan administration for deserting the
                    Democratic National Platform of 1856, and pleaded with his audience to resist both the northern
                    sectionalism as represented by Lincoln and the southern sectionalism as symbolized by
                        Breckinridge.<hi rend="sup">89</hi> Then Douglas proceeded to other parts of Indiana.<hi rend="sup">90</hi> But it was plain that he was being blocked by Bright's organization,
                    which would prefer the election of Lincoln to that of Douglas.</p>
            <p>Destiny was smiling on the Republicans in another way. This was due to the hatred of the Whig-minded
                    Constitutional Union men for anything smacking of the Democratic party. It was an era of ardent past
                    party loyalties.</p>
            <p>The Constitutional Union State Convention was held in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> on August 15 and endorsed Bell for President. The attendance was disappointingly small
                    and it was evident that Bell could not carry Indiana. Governor Morehead of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> was present, full of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> feeling that the Bell men and Douglasites should unite on one state ticket to defeat
                    the "sectional" Republicans. But Richard W. Thompson, most influential of all
                    Indiana Constitutional Unionists and never reconciled to any Democrat, had other ideas. At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Thompson denounced all Democrats as the authors of all the mischief that had been
                    done, and interpreted the rupture in the Democracy as a just reward for their tampering with the
                    nation's peace and welfare. He stated that none could be elected by popular vote except
                    Lincoln. He feared that if none of the four White House contenders—Lincoln, Douglas,
                    Breckinridge, or Bell—should receive a majority of the electoral college and the election
                    should be decided by Congress, the House of Representatives <list type="footnotes">

                    </quote> Thereupon Thompson issued a circular addressed to the "Conservative Men of
                    Indiana," contending that too much attention was paid to national politics and not enough
                    to state affairs. The prospect of Joe Lane as President would be a triumph for disunion, Thompson
                    argued. He could not see how Whigs, who constituted the bulk of the Constitutional Union party,
                    could be asked to vote for Hendricks, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, who had supported

                    Republican Henry S. Lane for governor, since his election would revive the spirit of Whiggery, for
                    which Thompson had long been laboring. Between Lane and the Bell men there was but one
                    difference—slavery—and upon that question Lane as governor would have no
                    opportunity to do anything, since he would have no power outside Indiana.</p>
            <p>William K. Edwards, next to Thompson the most powerful Bell leader in the state, shared
                    Thompson's views. Other Constitutional Unionists became impressed with such reasoning, for
                    they began to drift toward the Republican state ticket, "not because they believe in its
                    principles but because of the desire to defeat the Democrats." By early October it was
                    obvious that most Bell men would vote for Henry S. Lane for governor.<hi rend="sup">94</hi> Too,

            <p>The state election was held October 9. With the Bell men supporting Lane, and with the Bright
                    Democrats doing likewise rather than go for the pro-Douglas Hendricks, there could be only one
                    result: the election of Henry S. Lane as governor. It was a close race. Of over 260,000 votes cast,
                    Lane received a majority of less than 10,000 over Hendricks. The Douglasites blamed

            <p>Even a casual reading of Jack London's chief autobio-grahpical novels, <hi rend="i">The

                    that their author was a hearty proponent of the scientific concepts of Darwin, as elaborated by
                    Spencer and others. Time and again occur such phrases as "the iron facts of
                    biology," or "the savage interpretation of biological facts"; and as London rides
                    over the peaceful acres of his ranch in the Valley of the Moon he sees even there "the

                    of these two biographers in stressing the significance of her father's own reading, strikes
                    an iconoclastic note. Particularly after his return from his "Odyssey of the
                    North" his desires for immediate intellectual attainment coupled with brilliant literary
                    success were so strong that he gave up any effort at independent education. "A devout
                    believer in short cuts, and with access to the stored-up knowledge in the minds of generous friends,
                    he postponed serious study to a time when he had begun to earn a living at writing and could slow
                    his pace." But this leisure never came; and from his too hasty and superficial acquaintance
                    with, and too facile acceptance of his scientific and economic authorities Jack London, in the eyes
                    of his daughter, emerged actually "little better than half-educated"; for he had a
                    "lifelong dependence" on expository books written, or ideas expressed by other
                        people.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>It is at this crucial point that Jordan steps in as a highly influential mediary in clarifying and
                    interpreting the problems of the physical world for the young London. President David Starr Jordan
                    of <placeName>

                    </placeName> Bay region. Already celebrated as a research scholar and writer while at Indiana
                    University, Jordan had gone west in 1891 on the invitation of Leland <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Sr., to head his new institution. Under the aegis of his beloved mentor, Agassiz,
                    Jordan had originally refused to accept the Darwinian theory, but had acquired from the older man
                    the scientific attitude of questioning all authority and of keeping his mind hospitable to new
                    ideas. So in his own serious studies in zoology and icthyology Jordan was eventually
                    "converted to the theory of divergence through Natural Selection," though not
                    without some argument. In looking back on this formative <list type="footnotes">

                    I went over to the evolutionists with the grace of a cat the boy 'leads' by its

            </p>
            <p>As a public figure Jordan was called upon for frequent lectures and addresses, in addition to his
                    work as university administrator and professor. He divided his interest between scholastic and
                    inspirational topics, and discussions of the new science which he deemed so vital in its application
                    to life and society. Writing prolifically and speaking widely, he elaborated and popularized the
                    doctrines of Darwin and Spencer. And while giving such a series of scientific lectures he first came
                    in contact with Jack London: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I first met him in Oakland as an attendant at my university extension course on Evolution. He
                            was then a stocky young fellow of great physical strength and endurance as well as of
                            decided individuality. Being much interested in the subject of my lectures, he became in
                            some degree an intellectual disciple, a fact he freely recognized and testified to in
                            "The Call of the Wild" and other tales. At one time I asked him to come to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                            </placeName> to read from his Alaskan stories. His manner was both modest and effective, and
                            awakened the kindly personal interest of his hearers.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote>That Jordan made in good faith such a claim of discipleship of this "thorough
                    master of trenchant English and picturesque incident" cannot be doubted. Jordan was a world
                    renowned figure in the realms of education, scientific research, and pacifism at the time he wrote
                    his memoirs, and was in no need of any derivative publicity. But it is interesting to find
                    verification, too, in Jack London's own words.</p>
            <p>He undoubtedly heard Jordan lecture on "Evolution: What It Is and What It Is Not,"
                    "The Elements of Organic Evolution," "The Kinship of Life,"
                    "The Evolution of the Mind," and kindred subjects. In addition he had heard Jordan
                    as a guest speaker at the socialistic Oakland organization known as the Ruskin Club.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> So it is not surprising that in July, 1899—a year after his return from
                    Alaska—one finds Jack London writing to his friend Cloudsley Johns: "I am glad
                    that you took Jordan in the right way. He is, to a certain extent, a hero of mine… Would

                        "<hi rend="sup">10</hi> These are strong words from the self-assertive and
                    individualistic Jack London. That this admiration was intellectual as well as personal is borne out
                    by the fact that London three months before writing this had acquired Jordan's published
                    lectures and essays called <hi rend="i">Footnotes to Evolution</hi>.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Part of
                    the material in this volume he must have already heard in the classroom; and he could also have

                    example, to which Jack London was a contributor, had published three. In spite of these facts London
                    evidently wished to own and to have constantly available Jordan's treatises on science.</p>
            <p>There should be no exaggeration of the influence of David Starr Jordan on Jack London. Nevertheless,
                    as a young man of boundless confidence and ambition but little actual scientific knowledge, London
                    quite naturally revered an authoritative, practical scholar whose defense' and exegesis of
                    the newer science appealed to him in view of his own past experiences. Too, as has been pointed out,
                    London felt so pressed for time that any digest or simplification of a body of knowledge beckoned
                    irresistibly to him. And of such a course of lectures Jordan remarked: "Its chief quality,
                    highly praised at the time, lay in bringing abstruse conceptions into line with the common knowledge
                    of educated people."<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is not illogical to believe that it was Jordan with his popularization and summary of the
                    thought of Darwin, Spencer, and Huxley, and not London's own juvenile and groping reading,
                    that served as the most active influence in the building of Jack London's intellectual
                    platform; and that in the realm of science and evolution, with its struggles and survivals, Jack
                    London was indeed an "intellectual disciple" of David Starr Jordan.</p>

                    </placeName>, on October 16, 1942, brought vividly to my mind his visit to the office of the
                    Historical Bureau in the State House in February, 1925. After explaining the probability of a new
                    bridge over the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, just above the site of Fort Sackville, he asked me if the Indiana Historical Society
                    could not be induced to erect a statue of George Rogers Clark on the site of the fort, the surrender
                    of which on February 25, 1779, was the climax of his heroic "Conquest of the Old
                    Northwest." The enlargement of the plan of the proposed memorial and its realization were
                    the center of his activities for the following fifteen years. The story will bear retelling here.</p>
            <p>The approach of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the surrender of Colonel Henry Hamilton
                    made the project timely, and the observance of other anniversaries of the War of the American
                    Revolution brought it added enthusiasm. Not long afterwards, Culbertson, Mason J. Niblack, and I
                    went over the ground at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It became apparent to us that something more than a statue would be appropriate. A
                    plan, which at first seemed visionary, of acquiring the area between the church of St. Francis
                    Xavier and the river and between the future bridge and DuBois Street, was suggested. At a meeting of
                    the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Historical Society on August 25, 1925, Culbertson and Niblack secured the passage of
                    rousing resolutions calling for a national celebration of the anniversary of the capture of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and asking the Indiana Historical Society to "take full charge of this
                    celebration." They presented these resolutions to the executive committee of the society at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> during a historical pilgrimage which the society conducted to that city, <placeName>

            <p>The memorial committee, thus named, at its first meeting, on January 26, 1926, added D. Frank
                    Culbertson to its membership and elected William Fortune chairman. The effort to secure cooperation
                    from the other states of the Old Northwest, continued throughout the movement, while it had a
                    far-reaching educational effect, got no financial contributions. I well recall Culbertson's
                    eloquent presentation of the Clark memorial to a committee of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Legislature—which resulted in bringing to life a bill (all hope of which had
                    been lost) appropriating a considerable sum for the acquisition and marking of sites in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> associated with the War of the American Revoluution.</p>
            <p>The committee operated on an appropriation of nine hundred dollars from the Historical Society, a
                    grant of several hundred dollars from the Society of Indiana Pioneers, contributions secured by
                    Culbertson in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and help from the Governor's Contingent Fund.</p>
            <p>It was soon decided to ask the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to purchase the old blockhouse square, to have both the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> County issue bonds to the amount of one hundred thousand dollars each for the purchase
                    of additional land, to introduce a bill in the Indiana General Assembly for a tax levy, the proceeds
                    of which would be used for the purchase of land and for the erection of a memorial, and to ask
                    Congress to make an appropriation. The pledge of the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to present the old blockhouse square to the memorial organization was given at a large
                    luncheon at the Gibault Boys' School on May 24, and in due time bond issues of one hundred
                    thousand dollars each by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> County were authorized by the legislature. Both were subsequently issued and sold.
                    Culbertson proved a consummate master in drafting bills providing for the erection of a memorial by
                    the state of Indiana and for an appropriation by Congress and in promoting their passage. The former
                    created the George Rogers Clark Memorial Commission of Indiana, with fifteen members, and made a tax
                    levy which yielded approximately four hundred thousand dollars. It was passed by unanimous vote in
                    the house, and <pb n="413" id="VAA4025-038-4-083"/> with only one dissenting voice in the senate,
                    and was approved by Governor Ed Jackson, February 23, 1927. The bill introduced in Congress about
                    the same time made little progress during that session.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, from the very beginning, an extensive educational program was carried out by the committee
                    of the Indiana Historical Society and by the state commission when it took over. <hi rend="i">The
                        Indiana History Bulletin</hi> devoted part of each issue to the memorial movement. Many
                    newspapers carried full accounts of the meetings and of events of the Revolution in the West. A
                    pilgrimage was made to the birthplace of George Rogers Clark near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Monticello</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, on the one hundred and seventy-fifth anniversary of his birth, November 19, 1752; the
                    one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of each significant event in Clark's campaign in <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and Indiana was successfully and appropriately observed. The John Hancock Life
                    Insurance Company made Clark the subject of one of its illustrated historical pamphlets and
                    circulated hundreds of thousands of copies. Milo M. Quaife's edition of Clark's
                    account of his campaigns and Colonel Henry Hamilton's report (both with corrected spelling
                    and grammar) was reprinted; and a copy was presented to President Ccolidge and to each member of
                    Congress, with his name in gilt letters on the front cover. It became apparent afterward that many,
                    probably the majority, of these read the book. Several biographies of Clark and accounts of the
                    conquest of the Old Northwest were issued by commercial publishers. George Rogers Clark was the
                    theme of innumerable public addresses before historical societies, clubs, teachers'
                    meetings, and hereditary patriotic organizations. The Italians of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> organized a Francis Vigo Memorial Association to memorialize Clark's friend
                    and financial backer.</p>
            <p>At the hearing before the Joint Committee on the Library at the 69th Congress, January 18, 1927, the
                    significance of the taking of Fort Saqkville was presented by speakers from Indiana and other
                    states, including the late Dr. J. Franklin Jameson. A favorable committee report was obtained after
                    weeks of personal interviews by Mr. Culbertson with nearly all of the leaders of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate and House of Representatives. A bill strongly supported by Senator Simeon D.

                    </placeName>, and others, the bill passed the House of Representatives on May 7, 1928. As passed,
                    the bill created the George Rogers Clark Sesqui-centennial Commission of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and appropriated a million dollars for the construction of a memorial at Vin-cennes by
                    that commission. Thus the movement, begun as a historical society memorial project, promoted as an
                    interstate celebration, and changed by Indiana statute to a state project, assumed the form of a
                    national memorial to be erected by a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> commission on land provided by the city of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the county of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName>, and the state of Indiana.</p>
            <p>Plans for the memorial developed apace with the scope of the movement. The committee of the Indiana
                    Historical Society engaged H. Van Buren Magonigle, an architect of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> City, to make a study of the whole situation and draft a general plan for the memorial.
                    He insisted upon the enlargement of the grounds, proposed a monumental structure, and urged the
                    changing of the proposed <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> River bridge from a steel truss type to a concrete structure. The federal commission
                    engaged William E. Parsons, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as architectural advisor and the firm of Bennett, Parsons, and Frost as architect of
                    the grounds. In a competition arranged by Parsons, the plans submitted by Frederic C. Hirons, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> City, were selected for the memorial building. It took three years, numerous meetings
                    in Indiana, two formal visits of the commission to Governor Len Small, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>—the last time with Governor Ed Jackson in the company—and the
                    cooperation with <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> in building a bridge at Mount Carmel to get the present beautiful concrete bridge
                    instead of the proposed steel truss bridge over the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. A veritable fight was necessary to have the memorial building of suitable granite, in
                    the face of the opposition of Indiana limestone interests. An additional appropriation was made by
                    the state of Indiana. Culbertson, by this time well acquainted with most of the members of Congress,
                    secured three additional appropriations from the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government. The greatest disappointment of the whole movement was the failure to secure
                    the removal of the railroad track from the memorial grounds. The final success of the movement was
                    reached in the dedication of the memorial by the President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> on June 14, 1936.</p>

            <p>The Progressive Party of Indiana had made an auspicious beginning in 1912, for although the election
                    had gone to the Democrats the Progressives had run ahead of the Republican ticket.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Two years later, however, the new party dropped far below its two rivals. Yet it remained a
                    political factor of considerable importance, and speculation as to its probable influence in the
                    next presidential election began immediately and continued unceasingly. At the Progressive National
                    Convention of 1916 Theodore Roosevelt was nominated for President, but he rejected its proffered
                    honor and bade his followers support the Republican nominee, Charles Evans Hughes. The Indiana
                    Progressives were thereby confronted with the choice of going back to the Republicans, going over to
                    the Democrats, or making a last ditch fight to maintain a separate state organization. The following
                    letters, taken from the William Dudley Foulke Collection<hi rend="sup">2</hi> of the Indiana State
                    Library, Indiana History Division, reflect that situation.</p>
            <p>In the first letter Foulke wrote to Theodore Roosevelt of the feeling among local Progressives that
                    the party had been betrayed by its leaders. Roosevelt replied with strong indictments of President
                    Wilson and expressed his opposition <list type="footnotes">

                            author he was perhaps its leading citizen throughout most of that period. His wide ranging
                            interests and versatility were indicated by his many publications on topics as diverse as

                            he was one of the most ardent of the military preparedness advocates. Foulke, a former
                            Republican, had joined the Progressive Party in 1912, activated apparently by his liberal
                            political philosophy (he had been a Mugwump in 1884) and by his admiration for Theodore

                    the papers in the Theodore Roosevelt Collection at the Library of Congress for the period since
                    March, 1909, will not be available for a number of years. The last three letters are between Foulke

            <p>Taken together these communications indicate that Hughes was more acceptable to the local

                    that Progressives and Republicans found greater emotional unity in opposing Wilson than they did in

                        <salute>My dear Col. Roosevelt:</salute>
                        <p>I think you ought to know the condition of affairs in Indiana. At a meeting of
                                    Progressives from all parts of the state yesterday, the feeling of about two-thirds
                                    of those who attended was very bitter against you, Perkins, Garfield, Dye (our
                                    national committeeman) and others, for what they were pleased to call a betrayal of
                                    the party, and against the Republican machine and candidates, particularly
                                    Fairbanks, New, Watson and some of the men of the Republican State
                                    ticket….</p>
                        <p>I am not sure that there is not some Democratic scheme behand it. I don't
                                    quite see how the campaign is to be otherwise financed. Many of those who attended,
                                    acted like wild men. I tried to call their attention to the greater need of the
                                    country and to dangers from without but to no effect. This was all a scheme they
                                    thought to run them back into the Republican party and the danger from within was
                                    much greater than that from without, etc.</p>

                                        Progressives in 1912 had labeled the "Old Guard." Ironically,
                                        from the standpoint of the Progressives, Hughes was to be defeated in the coming
                                        election (though he carried Indiana) and the Republican State candidates

                                    would cool down. But it is now more intense than ever and utterly uncontrollable. Of
                                    course you have done just right and every sensible man ought to know it, but their
                                    disappointment won't let them see anything else. I don't know what
                                    to advise. Probably it is best to let the thing run its course. I am not sure but

                        <salute>Dear Foulke:</salute>
                        <p>I am really pleased that you should have given me the information that you have given
                                    me about Indiana. I am utterly unable to understand the attitude of Lee.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> For nearly two years I have been attacking Wilson as no
                                    Republican has attacked him, and I attacked him for a year when most of the
                                    Republicans, including Mr. Taft, were inclined to support him. The Progressives who
                                    then supported me, and who insisted upon my nomination, must have done so, if they
                                    were intelligent and sincere, because I represented extreme hostility to Wilson. It
                                    is therefore now utterly incomprehensible how these men can support Wilson.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe in maintaining the Progressive organization in the various states.
                                    They have become small derelict parties of the kind that are the natural prey of
                                    cheap crooks, and of those cranks whose crankiness has in it something sinister.
                                    Bainbridge Colby is taking substantially the attitude the people in Indiana of whom
                                    you speak are taking.</p>
                        <p>Some entirely honest Progressives will vote for Wilson, but I have no possible
                                    sympathy with the movement. It should be understood that the real Progressives have
                                    no sympathy with fake Progressives who are trying to run the party as an adjunct of
                                    the Democracy.</p>

                        <p>Reports that are coming to me from all sections of the West are most encouraging. I
                                    am confident that not less than eighty-five percent of those who followed Col.

                                    such substantial numbers as I believe them to be, the Republican National ticket
                                    will be elected with a rousing majority.</p>
                        <p>I hope that Progressives everywhere will get into this fight with enthusiasm. When
                                    Mr. Hughes has been elected, I want every fair minded man to recognize his victory
                                    was due, in no small degree, to the enthusiastic support accorded him by those of us

                        <salute>Dear Sir;—</salute>
                        <p>I think the majority of Progressives in this neighborhood are for Mr. Hughes though
                                    it is more divided than I should like to see it, the County chairman I think being
                                    for Wilson. The majority of us however will not support the Republican ticket all
                                    through. I shall certainly not vote for Mr. Watson after his Mulhall record in
                                    Congress and our present mayor, a Progressive tells me he intends to support a
                                    Democratic State ticket. He is probably for Hughes but not certainly. He wants to
                                    see what more Hughes says and does and is somewhat disappointed with his campaign.</p>
                        <p>I have received letters from <placeName>

                                    </placeName> showing great disappointment there by Progressives. I cannot say there
                                    is great enthusiasm for Hughes and I think his main support is on account of the
                                    utter disgust and contempt for the hypocritical weathercock now in <placeName>

                        <p>I appreciate very much your letter of September 12th. Mr. William D. Cousin, who is
                                    in Indiana at my request canvassing the situation by personal interview among
                                    Progressives, writes me that you have <list type="footnotes">

                                    National issues that we can use from these headquarters as publicity. I am very glad
                                    indeed that you are willing to do this, and I look forward with interest to seeing
                                    the statement.</p>
                        <p>I realize that the Progressives of Indiana have a situation to face that is
                                    distressing to most of them. I hope, however, that regardless of local matters, the
                                    Progressives of Indiana will do as you indicate they are likely to do, namely,
                                    support Mr. Hughes for President.</p>

                    South suffered severely during the war. The fall of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and the control of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, however, tended to immobilize such military or economic strength as the state
                    retained, and this book gives one the impression that <placeName>

                    </placeName> contributed little to the Confederacy beyond manpower. It is because Professor Bragg

                    </placeName>, has not received the attention it deserves from students of the Confederacy that he
                    has written this book, "an attempt to tip the scales, howsoever lightly, in favor of a
                    neglected section and people."</p>
            <p>In broad outline, the book is a straightforward narrative of the history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> from secession to June 10, 1865, when Governor Wells congratulated the people on being

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> flag. The study is based upon extensive collections of manuscript and printed sources,
                    as the extensive bibliography indicates. Primarily, the treatment is political and economic,
                    although military events receive sufficient consideration. In so far as the secession movement and

                    accomplishments of governors Moore and Allen receive attention.</p>
            <p>If one were to venture a general criticism of the study, it would be that it does not go far enough,
                    that it does not reveal some important aspects of the life of the people, that it is more a factual
                    narrative than a penetrating analysis. One may wish to know, for example, what happened to the
                    literary or cultural life of the people, whether there were amusements or diversions to relieve the
                    tension of war, whether civil liberties were submerged. If <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> had an educational system which was affected by the war, it is not revealed in this
                    book. What happened to the churches, orphan homes, and similar institutions? We find no discussion
                    here of the Confederate judiciary in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>. The reviewer thinks other topics could have been more adequately treated. The author
                    points out, for example, that the racial population of the state was heterogeneous; but he does not
                    explain what difference this made in the history of the war era. The discussion of the wide-spread
                    disloyalty in the state seems too general. The problem of the hospitalization of soldiers is
                    dismissed in a brief paragraph. There is, however, an interesting account of the manufacture of
                    medicinal supplies. The book, in short, whets our appetite but does not satisfy it. It is possible
                    that the restraint which the author has shown so admirably in treating military events has been used
                    with less justification in presenting other topics less well known.</p>

            <p>On December 9, 1816, the House of Representatives adopted a resolution recognizing Indiana's
                    admission to statehood; on the same day Peter H. Wendover offered a resolution to the same House for
                    the appointment of a committee to consider the problem of the alteration of the Flag. This
                    alteration was to consume fitful discussions for a period of eighteen months. By the Flag Act of
                    April 4, 1818, the Flag of fifteen bars was abandoned, and the present basic <pb n="423" id="VAA4025-038-4-093"/> description of Old Glory was adopted; as of July 4th of the same year,
                    the Flag of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> was to consist of "thirteen horizontal stripes, alternate red and
                    white," and a Union of "twenty stars, white in a blue field." It was
                    furthermore provided that, effective the July 4th following the admission of each new state, an
                    additional star should be added to the Union. It remained for President Taft's proclamation
                    of 1912 to determine the present form of the Flag—thirteen bars and forty-eight stars.</p>
            <p>In a volume that has popular appeal, Dr. Quaife has traced the history of the Flag of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, prefacing his main discussion with several chapters devoted to the history of the use
                    of flags in general and the evolution of the British Union and Meteor flags in particular. In
                    illustrating the easy stages by which our own Flag evolved from Britain's banner, the
                    author has dispelled those myths which have been held tenaciously by the popular imagination. This
                    book may well provoke controversy, for Quaife has appeared here as an iconoclast: Betsy Ross is
                    dismissed as the flag-maker to the Continental Congress; the design did not come from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> coat-of-arms; the Stars and Stripes as popularly known was not carried by any of the
                    Revolutionary armies; the story of the Portsmouth quilting party and the John Paul Jones flag is a
                    pious fraud; Peale and Trumbull obviously "doctored" their historical paintings to
                    make them more marketable; Old Glory is not the world's oldest existing flag—all
                    these romantic musings the author punctures by careful analysis and comparison of the myth with the
                    available facts.</p>
            <p>Scholars working in American history will find much of this no news; but to the general reader,
                    Quaife's refutation of "truths" gained through grammar school study of
                    American history may come as a revelation. Even today patriotic agencies, the
                    "movies," and official handbooks continue these historical
                    falsehoods—myths, perhaps, is a happier word. Among the numerous volumes on this same
                    subject, even such recent writers as Frederick Hicks and Willis Johnson have hesitated to whack at
                    the old myths about the flag with the same vigor that characterizes Quaife's most recent
                    work. Despite the emotional character of the subject, the author has remained largely free from
                    chauvinistic expression. He does not write down to his audience, and <pb n="424" id="VAA4025-038-4-094"/> though the book reads with ease, the footnotes are adequate guides for
                    more extensive reading for those who question Quaife's contentions or prefer to investigate
                    at greater length. The volume would have benefited by the addition of a bibliography of the
                    literature about the Flag.</p>

                    biographer, he was "galloping into history, art, editorials, folklore, poetry; the beat of
                    those hooves never to be forgotten." Even at his death, forty-three years later,
                    "the legend had not as yet risen up to swallow the actual man…. [Those] who had

                    face enveloped in the blackness of a famous night of almost half a century before, to become in time
                    hardly a man at all—only a hurry of hooves in a village street, a voice in the dark, a
                    knock on a door, a disembodied spirit crying the alarm."</p>
            <p>Esther Forbes has given us, in five hundred garrulous pages, the portrait of a man far different from
                    the mysterious, romantic figure of Longfellow's poem or Grant Wood's painting. Her
                    Paul Revere emerges as a solid, practical, versatile individual, a regular churchgoer addicted to
                    card-playing, the father of sixteen children, a maker of false teeth, a skilled worker in silver,
                    and an outstandingly successful entrepreneur in the age when the artisan was becoming the modern
                    industrialist. The Paul Revere who, at the age of sixty-five, invested —25,000 of his own
                    and —10,000 borrowed from the young Federal government in one of the first copper-rolling
                    mills in the country is probably of greater significance in our history than the Paul Revere who
                    carried subversive messages between <placeName>

                    the redcoats in <pb n="425" id="VAA4025-038-4-095"/> 1775, and participated in the ill-fated
                    Penobscot expedition in 1779.</p>
            <p>The present volume, which traces the varied lives of its subject, is both much more and much less
                    than a complete biography. Less, because there is not enough material available to give any but the
                    thinnest account of Revere's activities during a considerable part of his life and because
                    Miss Forbes eschews the methods of those biographers who make up what they cannot find out. More,
                    because to compensate for the inadequate material the author paints in a background of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> in the eighteenth and early ninteenth centuries which at times almost completely
                    swallows up the subject. This is a discursive, leisurely, and often fascinating book. Miss Forbes
                    has evidently steeped herself in the literature of the time, manuscripts as well as printed
                    materials, and through her pen old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> comes to life again. Let the historical scholar complain, as he will, that she rarely
                    indicates the sources of her information, even in the case of direct quotations; the average reader
                    will take her word and admire her erudition. Bits of lore on all sorts of odd subjects find their
                    way into the pages; the peculiar characteristics of eighteenth-century New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> horses and Dr. Samuel Willard's advanced ideas on occupational therapy for the
                    mentally deranged are alike grist for Miss Forbes' slow-grinding mill. A quiet humor often
                    enlivens her descriptions of the customs of the times:</p>
            <p>"There were plenty of frolics during which an old English roughness of manner and courting
                    customs come to the top (this phase of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> life has been ignored by Thanksgiving magazine covers and school pageants)."</p>
            <p>The defect in Miss Forbes' virtues is that there is no balance in her book between the
                    significant and the trivial, and between Revere and his surroundings. She is at times like a
                    talkative octogenarian who starts to tell something but wanders off into all sorts of conversational
                    byways before getting anywhere near her goal. (Notable example: in the midst of an interesting
                    description of the expulsion of Tories from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> she gets sidetracked, p. 328, into irrelevant comments on Revere as an engraver.) This
                    lack of discipline is accompanied by a certain shallowness of perception regarding the forces
                    responsible for the Revolution. For all her skill in painting a colorful and animated picture of <pb n="426" id="VAA4025-038-4-096"/> eighteenth-century <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the author fails to convey any such understanding of why New Englanders were
                    rebellious as does, for example, John Miller, in his comparable but much more condensed biography of
                    Samuel Adams. The spirit of Oliver Wiswell is abroad in the land, and at times Miss Forbes comes
                    close to being a gentler, less poisonously reactionary Kenneth Roberts. To be sure, since her
                    subject is a Revolutionary hero, she cannot, like Roberts, make <hi rend="i">all</hi> the rebels
                    dirty, insolent, and pockmarked. But it is curious that twice (pp. 103 and 126) she compares the
                    first strong demonstration of the Sons of Liberty to the Fascist march on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName>; and of these rough-mannered but essentially democratic Revolutionists she goes so far
                    as to say (p. 125): "With their marchings and their feasts and their secret oaths, they
                    bear an unpleasant likeness to modern storm troopers." Some indication of the
                    author's attitude can be had from a comparison of her grossly unfair remark about Sam Adams
                    with her approving comment on the Reverend Mather Byles, a Tory:</p>
            <p>"That Adams had a certain affection for humble people cannot be questioned, but he had
                    abysmal contempt for their intelligence. He appealed only to their emotions, not to their minds.
                    Fireworks, illuminated pyramids, flags, free feasts, and slogans were all he seems to have thought
                    they could understand [p. 108]."</p>
            <p>"Certain of his [Byles'] remarks handed down to the present make pretty good sense.
                    'They call me a brainless Tory,' the famous Doctor Byles once said as he watched
                    three thousand Sons of Liberty parading the streets of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 'but tell me, my young friend, which is better, to be ruled by one tyrant
                    three thousand miles away or three thousand tyrants not a mile away?' "</p>
            <p>Lesser errors are the lack of grammatical logic which leads Miss Forbes into repeated errors of
                    structure when her sentences grow somewhat complicated, the misspellings of the name of Lord Bute
                    (p. 101) and of Noddle's Island (p. 440), and the author's reference to
                    "a pence a week" (p. 27). The book is provided with a bibliography, a section of
                    genealogical data, and a set of supplementary notes for such miscellaneous items as even Miss
                    Forbes' ingenuity could not weave into, or pin on, the fabric of her narrative. Good
                    printing and generous illustrations increase the pleasure of <pb n="427" id="VAA4025-038-4-097"/>
                    the reader in an interesting book. The attractive adaptation of Price's map of <placeName>

            <p>Two years ago the educational world may have been only mildly interested in an effort to popularize
                    for adolescents "man's struggle for freedom and what those freedoms
                    are—here—now." And the <hi rend="i">Booklist,</hi> XXXVII, p. 328,
                    may have properly expressed doubt that this attractive little book by Mrs. Albjerg and Dr. Knight
                    "will have value as a permanent addition to children's collections." But
                    teachers of social studies who are wracking their brains to make adaptations in response to an
                    all-out war effort will find here an excellent collateral reference. Apparently the larger cities
                    and towns have already found it quite usable, judging from comments heard by the reviewer at recent
                    professional meetings.</p>
            <p>Although nominally for junior high school pupils, <hi rend="i">We, the Guardians of Our Liberty</hi>
                    recounts so many interesting incidents in what is all too often a catalogue of legislative and
                    constitutional developments, that seniors studying government will also appreciate it.
                    Academically-minded teachers doubtless will be pleased to learn that the chapter on the English Bill

            <p>A valuable bibliographical aid to historians and scholars <pb n="428" id="VAA4025-038-4-098"/> in
                    general has been produced by Doctor Winther. It is both a bibliography and a bibliography of
                    bibliographies because it lists bibliographical articles on the Trans-<placeName>

                    </placeName> West.</p>
            <p>To be evaluated intelligently its limits must be understood. It is an index of professional and
                    semiprofessional periodicals, including the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>

                    the <hi rend="i">American Political Science Review,</hi> and a number of the general magazines which
                    were more likely to contain historical articles, such as the <hi rend="i">Atlantic Monthly,
                        Harper's Magazine, Hunt's Merchants' Magazine, Mid-America,
                        Niles' Weekly Register, North American Review,</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Overland
                        Monthly.</hi> The list includes approximately fifty titles, most of which are published west of
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> River. It does not include state historical periodicals published east of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, nor special publications of professional societies, such as proceedings and reports of
                    historical societies, published either east or west of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. The compiler suggests the desirability of a second volume to include the material
                    omitted. This is desirable because important material is excluded by this limitation. An example is
                    Frederic L. Paxson, "The Pacific Railroads and the Disappearance of the Frontier in
                    America," which appeared in the American Historical Association <hi rend="i">Annual Report
                        for 1907,</hi> a type of publication that is not included in the index.</p>
            <p>To make the volume thoroughly usable, a preface, a table of contents, a list of periodicals and
                    abbrevations, and an author index are included. The table of contents gives the topical arrangement
                    in considerable detail. Each entry in the list of articles is numbered and the author index refers
                    to these numbers. After each entry appears a symbol which indicates the nature of the entry, e. g.,
                    article, bibliographical material, journal or diary, letters, miscellaneous, newspapers, official
                    documents, and reminiscences.</p>
            <p>A perfect piece of work is too much to be expected and omissions may be found. For instance, slight
                    notice is taken of the farmers' movements; the table of contents does not refer to
                    agriculture, farmers, or Populists, and, although some of the literature is included in the index
                    under the separate states, not all of it appears. Whether it will be a substitute for the combing of
                    the tables of contents of western periodicals will depend upon a longer experience in using <pb n="429" id="VAA4025-038-4-099"/> the index than is possible in a hurried examination. Certainly
                    it will be invaluable as a check on the search of historical investigators for materials and as a
                    ready means of locating periodical material on western history.</p>
            <p>The amount of work incorporated in the volume may be roughly indicated by the number of entries,
                    3501, or by the fact that 244 volumes of the <hi rend="i">North American Review</hi> were indexed.</p>
