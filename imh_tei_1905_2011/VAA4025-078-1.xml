                    </placeName>, a small city in eastern Indiana, is one of the great landmarks of sociological
                    research. The Lynds and three assistants did the field work for the principal study in 1924 and
                    1925, and the results were published in 1929 as <hi rend="i">

                    influenced all subsequent American studies of stratification, local institutional patterns, and
                    community power. Robert Lynd, with a staff of five assistants, returned to <placeName>

                    quality report in the second survey because they already had a network of contacts and, mainly,
                    because they had "streamlined all their procedures and eliminated all luxuries and
                    exploratory devices." In other words they knew the questions they wanted answered; they had
                    a well-developed theoretical structure; thus, "they went directly into a newspaper-clipping
                    routine, into an analysis of the records that had accumulated since they had left and they
                    straightway undertook ‘scores of interviews, both formal and informal.’ Thus,
                    with obviously much reduced effort they brought together the material for the second

                    Lynd] had overlooked the all-permeating influence of the city's leading family of
                    industrialists." Accordingly, when required to do a research paper in sociology at the

                            numerous conversations, and for substantiation of them I wrote letters to several persons

                    planning to return to the middle western community for a follow-up study. He reacted to the

                        city sometime for employment. The sociologist did embody my study, supplemented by additional
                        interviews which it suggested, as a chapter on "The X Family" in his new book,

                    </placeName> had changed since 1924–1925 and whether the Lynds' original report
                    had been an accurate portrayal of community life. His paper applied these two questions to each of
                    the six major activities—getting a living, making a home, training the young, using
                    leisure, engaging in religious practice, and engaging in community activities—around

                    evident is the use that the Lynds made of the Perrigo paper in other contexts. A review of the book
                    and of Perrigo's manuscript reveals at least four points of comparison: 1)
                    Perrigo's criticism—or those of individuals whose written opinions he had

                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as recorded in his manuscript, are sometimes used as primary data from local
                    informants; and 4) in at least one case—a content analysis of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapers in 1934—-Perrigo functions as a researcher whose findings are

                    </placeName> that he knew. His major criticisms were that the influence of the X family had been
                    overlooked, that the city's ecology had been largely ignored, that local artistic and
                    spiritual values had been slighted, and that the influence of the state normal school had been
                    minimized. In <list type="footnotes">

                            1/2 printed pages. Frequently a summary sentence or two from Perrigo is the occasion for
                            several paragraphs or pages by the Lynds, and sometimes it appears that the Lynds have, in
                            effect, "dug where Pemgo pointed the way."</item>

            <p>In sum, the Perrigo manuscript served several functions for the Lynds: it was one of a number of
                    works providing criticisms of the earlier study that the Lynds answered in print; it provided
                    preliminary data on a topic to which the Lynds decided to devote an entire chapter; it contained
                    some source material which was used directly as the words of local informants; and it seems to have
                    had some "sensitizing" effect, not so much in telling the Lynds what to say as in
                    identifying some avenues which might merit additional documentation.</p>

                        population here does not read books as difficult as MIDDLETOWN. On one occasion when I expressed
                        surprise to a citizen that he had not read the book he asked me if it had pictures in it

                        … who, after reading it, told me that it was a microscopic study which caught
                        everything a microscope would catch. It, in his opinion, did not have enough perspective. He
                        used this figure: "a fly crawling over a brick wall might see the wall but certainly
                        could not see the building." He felt that there were forces there in <placeName>

                        forces, however, were just as potent, if not more potent than the ones that came under the

                    used by the Lynds, either as a guide to topics worth investigating in greater detail, as a
                    reflection of the relevant definitions held by the townspeople, or as authoritative primary source
                    material. Perrigo's treatment of the X family consisted of six paragraphs, some of them
                    over a page in length, with extensive footnotes. Paragraph one identified the X brothers as the
                    peers of Mid-dletown's industrial lords and briefly sketched their history. The second
                    paragraph described the extent of their "fiefs beyond their original manor" and
                    then said that in the remainder of the paper discussion would be limited to that "original

                    philanthropies; the fourth asked: "What does all this mean to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName>?" and summarized the benefits to the city; the fifth paragraph described
                    "some less beneficial effects" in considerable detail; and the final paragraph
                    concluded that despite "what might have been," the family had, on balance, borne
                    the responsibilities of wealth quite well. "They have," wrote Perrigo,
                    "done more in proportion to their means to distribute the benefits of wealth and promote
                    worthy causes than most others so favored."<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

                            in the then socially nondescript Normal School section of town. These houses have

                            college (p. 83). It is stated by one man who lived in this section that the agent secured
                            one of these properties by suggesting that a pesthouse was to be established in their midst
                            as part of the new hospital development, and that the X's did not feel that it
                            would be fair to property owners unless they bought up the homes in the neighborhood (p.

                            Normal School be built out of the moribund institution. In 1922 the X family gave a quarter
                            of a million dollars to the school toward its new building program (pp.

                    <p>[By 1934] the radio had established itself in nearly all homes. The latter no longer existed as a
                        manipulative hobby except for a very few, and its use had become entirely passive, yet it
                        offered a different kind of recreation from that of organized groups (p. 23).</p>

                        sometimes burdensome financially to their members and the community at large, and in some cases
                        their humanitarian service is crippled by too much emphasis on ability to pay (p. 45).</p>

                    <p>Music and athletics remained important phases of school activities in 1934; but in the latter
                        year the high school ‘Bearcats’ no longer occupied the whole stage because
                        of the competition for people's loyalty of good teams at Burris High School, the
                        college, and the several junior high schools (p. 17).</p>
                    <p>There had been, however, an era of church-building since Lynd's observation that
                        economic and social considerations had stopped that kind of activity. Easy money, building loan
                        companies, denominational rivalry, and crusading preachers—all figured as factors in
                        this spectacle. At least five new buildings went up before the depression reached its depths,
                        and two of them, downtown, were great cathedrals with fully modern equipment and machine-made
                        imitations of medieval artistry. This enthusiasm for building, even where not ultimately
                        realized, tended to stimulate church attendance in the boom years, while the continued expansion
                        of the program into extra-religious activities maintained Sunday school attendance. The
                        depression brought some change. The last mentioned activities were not seriously curtailed, but
                        the churches that had not yet built new homes had to postpone realization of their ambitions,
                        and those that had built were burdened with depressing financial obligations (p. 26). The
                        "building preachers" moved on to other fields, leaving the financial problems
                        and depleted and haggling congregations to their successors (p. 26n).</p>

                        part of the college laboratory school, in the junior high schools, and at the college. All of
                        these have tended to divide somewhat the loyalty that, ten years ago, headed up exclusively in
                        the Central High School team. As one citizen remarked, "The Bearcats no longer occupy
                        the whole stage" (p. 292).</p>

                        train. In the heart of the downtown section of the city two imposing new stone churches have
                        replaced rusty brick buildings that dated back to the gas-boom days of the 1880's. One
                        of these churches is a $350,000 plant including a $30,000 organ. In the
                        outlying sections of the city three other new churches were completed during the early years of
                        the depression. … All of these churches represent boom-time planning of the late
                        1920's (p. 296) Easy money, denominational rivalry, and crusading preachers coincided
                        with the obvious obsolescence of much local church property in producing this church-building
                        boom. At least three other churches began to build but were caught by the depression; they
                        succeeded only in putting in foundation and basement, roofed the latter over, and now worship in
                        these dugouts. Both ministers who drove through the building campaigns for the two large
                        downtown churches have since left, one of them under fire (p. 296).</p>

                    They bought the college site, gave it to the State, and then erected or aided in the finishing of
                    most of its present buildings. Nearby is the million-dollar X Memorial Hospital, which stands as an

                    spend a part of their vacation each summer. The Xs also helped put up the local Masonic Temple and

                    </placeName>? Obviously, the whole city has been benefited in many ways, for the Xs have been
                    benevolent lords. They have built, worked, contributed, and advised, as few men in similar
                    circumstances do or have done. And throughout the city stand structures that are not only monuments
                    to the Xs but great educational, religious, humanitarian, and artistic centers. The depression, too,
                    was alleviated in <placeName>

                    </placeName> by the presence there of the Xs and their factory, for they not only gave generously to
                    aid the poor and helped the banks through the crisis, but when other factories were closed, the
                    return of home canning everywhere made business for the glass industry. The X factory produced at
                    peak load throughout those critical years, and even more employees than were needed were added to
                    its payroll.<hi rend="sup">63</hi> And finally, the Xs themselves by their industry and altruism,
                    their interest in art, education, and religion, and their own high moral standards, have been an
                    inspiring and stimulating example to the whole community.<hi rend="sup">64</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, all this is not without some less beneficial effects. First, the very fact that so many
                    local groups are indebted to the Xs in one way or another tends to limit freedom and stint
                    initiative. Above all else, the very name of this family stands for the existing economic system,
                    for individualism and <hi rend="i">Iaissezfaire</hi>. So, as one of my correspondents cautioned,<hi rend="sup">65</hi> a person must be careful what he says about them lest they might cut some
                    local group out of their will. That means, too, that if one is employed in any of the X-supported
                    institutions he must be discreet in his criticism of the existing social and economic order. If one
                    adds the number of people connected with the college, the city schools, the X stores, and so on, to
                    the 1200 employed in the glass factory, it becomes apparent that about one-tenth of those gainfully

                    without the express sanction of the Xs or confidence that what they do is in harmony with previously
                    delineated X policies. There is one other less serious result. Not all of the X monumental
                    structures have adequate endowments for maintenance. The hospital, Masonic Temple, Y.M., and Y.W.,
                    for example, with their splendid equipment have high operation costs. As a result, these
                    organizations are sometimes burdensome financially to their members and the community at large, and
                    in some cases their humanitarian service is crippled by too much emphasis on ability to pay. Of

                    would have had to bow down to no one. Just who from among the masses would have given initiative and
                    leadership to such enterprises is not clearly indicated as a part of that argument. Perhaps the Xs
                    themselves, as mere members of a cooperative society, would have given coordinating leadership to
                    community projects. Or have they emerged as benevolent and foresighted promoters under the existing
                    system merely as a result of that system's giving them the wealth that made leadership not
                    only possible but almost unavoidable among economic men?</p>

            <p>During the first three decades of the twentieth century one of America's most important
                    humorists was Indiana's Frank McKinney "Kin" Hubbard, creator of
                    "Abe Martin." For twenty-five years, from 1904 to 1930, the comic sayings of
                    Martin and his neighbors in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName> in southern Indiana were highlights of the newspaper to millions of Americans. By 1910
                    the Abe Martin mania had so enthralled the country that there were "Abe Martin cigars,
                    overalls, cookies, whiskey, porch-furniture, lead pencils and moving picture theatres…<hi rend="i">."</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">1</hi> At the time of Hubbard's death in 1930
                    his humorous comments were nationally syndicated in more than three hundred newspapers and

            <p>Hubbard's Abe Martin appeared during the waning years of the crackerbarrel ascendancy in
                    American humor. The nineteenth-century crackerbarrel figure traditionally focused on political
                    involvement, rural residency, the fatherly image, employment, and success. Above all else he was a
                    capable figure in a world still based in eighteenth-century rationalism. If problems arose, common
                    sense and past experience would be enough to make any life well ordered again. The inability to cope
                    with a dilemma was an individual rather than a societal <list type="footnotes">

                        individualism.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the early twentieth century a transition was taking place in American humor. This change would
                    find its first full articulation in the <hi rend="i">New Yorker</hi> magazine of the 1920s,
                    especially in the writings of Robert Benchley, James Thurber, Clarence Day, and S.J. Perelman.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> These new writers focused on the comic antihero, a character almost the
                    complete antithesis of the crackerbarrel type. The antihero was nonpolitical, urban, childlike,
                    leisure-oriented, and frustrated—ften at the hands of his domineering wife. In his
                    earlier appearances in the comedy world the comic antihero had invariably represented the whipping
                    boy for the capable hero, and his frustration usually resulted from a failure to follow the
                    commonsense model of his crackerbarrel counterpart. By the second decade of the twentieth century,
                    however, the antihero was appearing on center stage. Abe Martin was a product of this transitional
                    period. He was in most respects a typical nineteenth-century crackerbarrel figure; yet, he was
                    increasingly at home in the twentieth-century world of the antihero. An examination of this
                    dichotomy will perhaps help to restore both Hubbard and Martin to their proper places in American
                    humor.</p>
            <p>The most dominant characteristic of the crackerbarrel figure, his fascination for politics, is a
                    trait for which Martin became famous. In fact, the birth of the character was the result of the 1904
                    presidential election. Hubbard had followed the Theodore Roosevelt-Alton B. Parker campaign for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>

                    accumulated a notebook full of drawings, including the figure of the eventual Abe Martin.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Never one to waste things, Hubbard introduced this character to the newspaper
                    shortly after the election. In the years that followed "Abe" became famous for
                    such classic political observations as "It's purty hard t' underpay a
                    city official" and "We'd all like t' vote fer th' best
                    man, but he's never a candidate."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>Despite the balance of subject matter in Hubbard's humor, when Abe Martin emerges from his
                    relative obscurity in the late twentieth century, he is usually quoted in a political context. Two
                    possible reasons occur. First, audiences have come to expect a political emphasis from the
                    crackerbarrel humorists; hence, readers focus on politics even though Hubbard did not. Second, the
                    political observations that Hubbard did make have weathered the passage of time somewhat more
                    gracefully than those of other, more political, crackerbarrel figures such as Will <list type="footnotes">

                    Mr. Dooley. The political sayings of Rogers and Dunne are more readily available and more frequently
                    quoted than Hubbard's; but politics was their main theme, and they dealt with more
                    topical—although quickly dated—subjects. Hubbard, on the other hand, generally
                    wrote in political generalities; such as, "How'd you like t' be marooned
                    in Napolean, Indianny, an' dependin' on th' Congress t' git you
                        out?"<hi rend="sup">9</hi> When he did deal with politics, he was thus seldom off the
                    mark; for example, "You can lead a feller to the polls, but you can't make him

                    </placeName>, Indiana, was in keeping with another basic trait of the crackerbarrel
                    figure—residency in small-town, rural America, of which Hubbard himself was a product.
                    Idealization of country life was a characteristic of eighteenth-century rationalism, which saw the
                    city as an unhealthy, unnatural place to live. The key to freedom was an agriculturally oriented
                    America in need of little government. Throughout his life Hubbard strongly believed in the
                    superiority of this self-reliant, small-town America. Abe Martin comments in 1907:
                    "Th' biggest ‘rubes’ at a State Fair er city
                        people";<hi rend="sup">11</hi> in 1929, near the end of his career, he cracks:
                    "I'm continually readin' o' fellers who've made good in
                    the city, but makin' good in a little town is the real test."<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Hubbard populated Martin's small-town America with a large collection of other
                    eccentric, crackbarrel neighbors reminiscent of the family Seba Smith gave Yankee Jack Downing in
                    his tales. It is from one of Abe's friends, the Reverend Wiley Tanger, that the most
                    thorough praise of the rural way of life is presented. <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>In true crackerbarrel tradition Abe Martin is an older, fatherly figure. His crackerbarrel wisdom is
                    a product of tried and tested experience, a valid premise in a world considered to be rational.
                    Situations and experiences repeated themselves, rationalists thought; thus, cause and effect became
                    predictable. In the crackerbarrel world, therefore, age is equated with wisdom and is venerated
                    because it represents an accumulation of experiences. Abe Martin neighbor Tell Binkley perhaps best
                    expresses this philosophy in a short essay entitled "Sixty." (Hubbard
                    "just happened" to be sixty at this time.) Binkley noted: one "has only
                    reached the shank o' young manhood at sixty," a condition with "judgment
                    an' experience … piled up…. "<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Hubbard
                    had earlier claimed that people only improve with age: "Cato took up Greek an'
                    learned it at eighty; Goethe wuz eighty when he put the finishin' touches on Faust;
                    Sophocles wrote Oedipus at four-score an' Theophrastus wuz ninety before he became popular
                    as a writer."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A major axiom for Abe Martin was that life is the only real teacher: "Ther hain't
                    no favorites in th' school o' experience"<hi rend="sup">17</hi> and
                    "Experience is a dear teacher but he delivers th' goods."<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Thus, like the vast majority of crackerbarrel figures, from Sam Slick to Will Rogers,
                    Martin questions formal education: "Lester Mopps has been out o' school fer nigh
                    on two years an' he can't even play a saxophone," Hubbard wrote in
                        1924.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> In fact, in typical crackerbarrel style, Abe often suggests that
                    formal schooling is a liability: "Miss Tawney Apple's cousin says he's
                    never been able t' find as good a job as he had before he went <list type="footnotes">

                    himself had profited little from formal education: he had dropped out of school during the grades,
                    and his one attempt at an advanced academic setting (the Jefferson School of Art in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>

                    critical and commercial success through the time-honored crackerbarrel "school o'
                    experience." Hubbard and Abe Martin obviously understood each other.</p>
            <p>Martin's crackerbarrel credentials have thus far been impeccable. He has personified the
                    wise, elder statesman of rural, small-town America. Two final characteristics associated with the
                    traditional crackerbarrel figure, career and success, are not, however, consistently apparent in Abe
                    Martin. Though Hubbard's drawings of Abe suggest that he is a farmer, they also depict a
                    perennial loafer; and Martin's sayings often underline this inactivity: "more
                    people die from overwork than all th loafin' put t'gether."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> That the posture of a loafer was a conscious move is implied by Hubbard biographer Fred
                    C. Kelly, who notes that early in the humorist's career he experimented with, but
                    discarded, a more "industrious farmer."<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Comedy historian
                    Norris Yates thus seems justified in calling Martin a "pensive loafer."<hi rend="sup">24</hi> Yates might also have added that Abe was often a most "frustrated
                    pensive loafer."</p>
            <p>Martin's deviation from the crackerbarrel mold in terms of leisure and frustration reflects
                    events in and characteristics of Hubbard's own personal life. Lesiure-time activities had
                    always been a central focus in the humorist's life; certainly his love affair with this
                    antiheroic trait predates the Abe Martin period. From childhood Hubbard had had a special weakness
                    for circuses and traveling theater productions, and his lifestyle had always been structured to meet
                    that fascination. As a young man he had become something of a carnival vagabond, moving from job to
                    job and place to place—always in or on the fringes of the entertainment world. During
                    this period he was employed as gatekeeper at an amusement park, ticket seller for a traveling show
                    that featured a mummified Aztec mother and child, and manager and performer in his own minstrel
                    show. Not surprisingly, people close to the young humorist often saw <list type="footnotes">

                    moved into newspaper work, several of his early positions often seemed contingent on his ability to
                    get free passes to local vaudeville performances; moreover, he had a tendency to spend much of his
                    early, modest newspaper salary on flashy clothing that he felt replicated that of the touring

            </p>
            <p>Abe Martin's great success allowed Hubbard to feed his vagabond nature in a grander style.
                    In 1924 he took a trip around the world. Unlike most crackerbarrel figures, who used travel to
                    report on national politics (such as Rogers's fame for covering each party's
                    presidential convention), Abe focused his travel reports on such leisure activities as girl-watching

            </p>
            <p>The second antiheroic characteristic in Hubbard's work—frustration—is
                    more a product of changes that the humorist experienced while writing the Martin material than an
                    innate characteristic of the man. Comedy references about wives and/or maniage—generally
                    a key focus of frustration for the antihero although virtually nonexistent in crackerbarrel
                    humor—best exemplify this developing frustration. Marriage was a rare institution among
                    the always independent Hubbard clan. None of the humorist's five older brothers and sisters
                    ever married, and Kin did not find his way to the altar until 1905 when he was in his late thirties.
                    Even then he felt 80 embarrassed about being a bridegroom that wedding guests were not allowed to
                    watch the ceremony.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> His union with Josephine Jackson, though generally

                    caused 'bout ez many tragedies ez liquor."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Children, too,
                    created special frustrations; the Hubbards had three such "blessings." Again, Abe
                    capsulizes things nicely: "Th' worst thing about bein' a parent is
                    havin' a little tired child come home from school ever' evenin' loaded
                    down with algebras, histories, French text books, an' writin' pads, an'
                    believin' we know enough t' help it."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the years passed, the frustrations visited upon Hubbard and Abe Martin were not limited to the
                    domestic scene. The most dramatic example stemmed from another real event in Hubbard's
                    life: during the 1920s he was robbed at gunpoint in his own home. The humorist drew several comic
                    sayings based in frustration from this incident as well as from the apparent increase in crime
                    during the 1920s. Martin noted: "The first thing a feller does when he's held up
                    is change his mind about what he used to think he'd do."<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
                    Automobiles also gave Hubbard problems. His alter ego moaned: "Why does a tire allus go
                    flat on the side where we're liable to git bumped off changin' it?"<hi rend="sup">37</hi> The ever-increasing sense of absurdity in the world—the whole
                    Hubbard clan was considered to be eccentric—was a constant source of comment:
                    "Th' Father o' Oscar Kite wuz found dead in two feet o' water,
                    t'day, weighed down by a sack o' doughnuts."<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although Abe Martin's frustrations and his focus on leisure are not enough to make this
                    crackerbarrel-based figure a true comic antihero, Hubbards comedy tended more in that direction with
                    each successive year of the twentieth century. By incorporating the relatively new, antiheroic
                    motifs into the more established milieu of the crackerbarrel figure, the Hoosier humorist emerges as
                    something of an innovator. His significance as a major figure of transition between two worlds of
                    comedy should be recognized.</p>

                        robbery at home also characterized the frustration of other comic antiheroes, especially those
                        in the work of James Thurber. See, for example, James Thurber, "Mr. Monroe Holds the
                        Fort," <hi rend="i">Owl in the Attic and Other Perplexities</hi> (<placeName>

                        a crime rarely does what he thought he would do anticipates Thurber's most famous
                        antihero, Walter Mitty, the milquetoast husband whose only bravery came in daydreams.</item>

            <p>On April 14, 1861, Confederate arms forced the surrender of <placeName>

               </placeName>, and
                    signaled the opening of the Civil War. News of the surrender brought an immediate transformation in
                    northern opinion. Months of passivity gave way to a profound commitment to preserve the Union.
                    Almost immediately companies of troops formed in cities and hamlets in the North. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington County</region>
                    </placeName>, nestled in the rolling hills of south-central Indiana, was no exception. The county
                    responded with a company of soldiers within a week. Before the initial enthusiasm flagged and the
                    proclaimed brevity of the conflict was belied by escalation of the term of enlistment from three
                    months to three years, nearly three more complete companies volunteered for service.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the initial flurry of excitement, volunteering lagged. Not until mid-1862 did substantial
                    numbers of enlistments resume. Both the anticipated use of the draft and the promise of a handsome
                    bounty to each volunteer may have spurred this new wave of enlistment in southern Indiana, but the
                    proximity of the war may also have been a factor. By late July, 1862, Confederate General Kirby
                    Smith was advancing rapidly through central <placeName>

                    </placeName> became. In early August an estimated five thousand people attended a war rally at the

                    Shortly thereafter four companies of men formed in various places across the county. The first group

                    head off the northern advance of General Smith. Most of the troops had been in camp less than ten
                    days, and all were without adequate military training or sufficient equipment. On August 30 the

                    employer, and he and his young family began farming for themselves. Soon the Davis family grew to
                    six in number with the birth of another son, William, in 1856 and a second daughter, Caroline, in
                        1860.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Situated on his own farm, surrounded by family and friends, Davis could have scarcely imagined before
                    April, 1861, that he would be unable to live out the rest of his life in relative tranquility. In
                    little more than a year, however, Davis's future was full of uncertainty. By late 1862 he
                    was instructing his wife on how to run the farm, lecturing the children on their behavior, and
                    inquiring about neighbors and friends from a distance of several hundred miles. As was probably true
                    of many soldiers, Davis was not particularly concerned with the tactics of war. Troop movements
                    interested him only insofar as they affected him personally, and he did not ponder, in his letters
                    at least, why he was fighting or what victory or defeat might bring. From the moment he left his
                    farm in mid-August, 1862, through his march with General William T. Sherman from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>

                    </placeName>, in June, 1865, Davis was concerned about the situation at home. All of his worries and
                    instructions had to be conveyed by a most awkward means—the writing of letters.
                    Davis's frustration with this means of communication is often evident; yet, his vivid
                    phonetic prose provides an interesting and informative account of a soldier's preoccupation
                    with life at home and in camp.</p>
            <p>One of the first letters that Davis wrote to his wife was sent from Camp Sullivan in <placeName>

                                    some one to save it. if the hay is stack in the meddow meby I can git home after
                                    awile and git it in the barn. I wold rather do that than put it out to some one. I

                                    have plenty hay. some of the men hear think the war will be over in three month. we

                                    in side of three weeks. I hope it may be so. it was thought that we wold go thare

                                            the war, Davis's reference must have been to the one led by Captain
                                            Thomas Hines. On June 17, 1863, Captain Hines and 150 Confederate troops
                                            crossed into Indiana to steal horses, destroy bridges, and disrupt rail
                                            service. During the raid they at least partially burned Valeene, a hamlet in <placeName>

                                            </placeName>. Early the following month Captain Hines joined forces with
                                            General John H. Morgan in a more well-known Confederate raid into Indiana.

                                            program for enlisting recruits. Under the plan each regimental commander
                                            selected one noncommissioned officer or private from each company to be sent
                                            home to gain recruits. If the man selected recruited a certain stated

                                            able-bodied men; and the promotion of Corporal Huston in April, 1864, to

                                 <hi rend="sup">40</hi> Davis's optimism about his chances of
                                            returning home may have reflected General William T. Sherman's
                                            tentative response to a letter that President Abraham Lincoln wrote to
                                            Sherman on September 19, 1864. In the letter Lincoln asked the general to
                                            allow as many Indiana troops under his command as he could spare to return
                                            home so that they might vote in the state election in October. Since the
                                            Indiana troops could not vote from the field, Lincoln believed that their
                                            return home would keep Indiana's Governor Morton in power and
                                            prevent Indiana from falling into Democratic hands. In the final analysis,
                                            however, Sherman was not left with a choice. In early October Confederate
                                            General John Bell Hood proved so menacing that Sherman could only allow some

            <p>Anthologies of essays and of excerpts from primary and secondary works about Indiana abound. The
                    first <hi rend="i">Readings in Indiana History</hi> appeared in 1914. Two years later the Indiana
                    Historical Commission issued <hi rend="i">Indiana as Seen by Early Travelers</hi>. After a long
                    lapse came Richard E. Banta's <hi rend="i">Hoosier Caravan</hi> in 1951. Banta's
                    volume was primarily a literary sampling, and its sale warranted an enlarged edition in 1975.
                    Between them the Indiana Historical Bureau published in 1956 a new <hi rend="i">Readings</hi>
                    followed in 1974 by another gathering, <hi rend="i">Progress After Statehood: A Book of

            <p>Now a seventh collection, <hi rend="i">The Hoosier State</hi>, has appeared in two volumes edited by
                    Ralph D. Gray. The first volume contains forty-five pieces, extending in time from prehistoric
                    cultures to post-Civil War political and railroad developments. Thirteen of the new selections are
                    source materials written by participants in or witnesses of the events narrated. The editor has
                    supplied introductions to the eight sections in which he has grouped his selections and provides
                    numerous bridges in his chronological arrangement. He has not hesitated to use secondary summaries
                    of what happened rather than dreary, incomplete contemporary accounts. Thus Ross
                    Lockridge's relation of La Salle's penetration of Indiana is much better than the
                    explorer's own account, and Theodore C. Pease evaluates the Northwest Ordinance as no
                    contemporary could. Similarly, Jacob Piatt Dunn gives an overall picture of slavery in early Indiana
                    that no slave narrative or abolitionist could supply. L. C. Rudolph's essay on early
                    settlers is a needed corrective to William M. Cockrum's idealized account.
                    Rudolph's paper on religion is perceptive but says nothing about frontier revivals,
                    although it is plainspoken about the preference of southern immigrants for "sect
                    groups" of "old-time religion." Farm life in the 1850s is wonderfully
                    done by Harvey L. Carter.</p>
            <p>Some other modern research articles are not as successful. Carmony's account of the fiasco
                    of internal improvements is limited to the agitation for them and their financial failure. He does
                    not describe the reasons for failure. the colorful canal <pb n="60" id="VAA4025-078-1-066"/>
                    traffic, or the construction work. George M. Waller sets George Rogers Clark's achievement
                    in its historical perspective, but he does not write with the flair and excitement of Clark himself
                    in his edited recital of the march on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. A curious choice is novelist Jessamyn West's fictional interpretation of the
                    trial of the white murderers of several Indians on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fall Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1824. It is well written, of course, and fills thirteen pages; yet, this brief
                    selection needs the atmosphere, motivation, and realism she developed in her book previous to this
                    scene. What apparently neither West nor possibly Gray knew was Samuel Woodworth's 1825
                    account of the principal perpetrator.</p>
            <p>The second volume covers the last one hundred years and contains fifty-two excerpts, of which at
                    least sixteen may be considered source materials. Four are from John Bartlow Martin. Excerpts from
                    Hoosier authors are a mixed bag. Booth Tarkington says something about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Theodore Dreiser reveals something about southern Indiana. James Whitcomb Riley
                    does not earn separate consideration. The essays on Kurt Vonnegut and Jean Shepherd throw no light
                    on their Indiana extraction. William E. Wilson's firsthand account of the Klan in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> is an excellent eye-opener, and Neil Betten's study of the Klan in two
                    northern cities is equally depressing.</p>
            <p>Indiana resorts, such as the northern lake towns, are given scant treatment; only French Lick is
                    described. Nothing is included on how Hoosiers entertained themselves, and there is nothing on their
                    health or medicines. Sports are confined to the 500-mile race, football, and a brief note on Indiana
                    University basketball, without mention of the all-absorbing high school tournament. Still, the
                    nearly one hundred selections offer something for almost every taste. Both volumes are profusely
                    illustrated, as the earlier anthologies were not, although the cover picture on the first volume
                    appears to be an enlarged fuzzy halftone. It is unfortunate that the publisher found it necessary to
                    charge $35.90 for the two volumes—and in paperback.</p>

                    Folklore Society. Since its inception in 1968 <hi rend="i">Indiana Folklore</hi> has earned a
                    reputation as one of the best state folklore journals in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, mainly because of its unique emphasis on publishing well-annotated field collections
                    from contemporary traditional culture. Largely due to the influence of Linda Degh, the editor of
                    both the state folklore journal and this anthology, graduate students in folklore at Indiana
                    University in the middle 1960s began more systematically than ever before to complement their broad
                    comparative studies of international folklore with in-depth contextual studies of folk culture in
                    Indiana. These well-trained student folklorists often published the results of their fieldwork in
                        <hi rend="i">Indiana Folklore</hi> and thus contributed significantly to the success of the
                    state journal and subsequently to the success of this collection.</p>
            <p>The articles in this anthology have been arranged under five general headings, called
                    "topical chapters" by the editor (p. viii). The first section, "Old
                    Crafts and Skills," contains articles on dry-stone walling, covered-bridge building, and
                    quiltmaking. "Old Crafts and Skills" is a rather unorthodox label for what
                    folklorists more commonly call "traditional material culture" or "folk
                    arts, crafts, and architecture." "Old Crafts and Skills" is an especially
                    inappropriate section heading in this anthology since it connotes what the editor has attempted to
                    avoid—a view of folklore "as something old and romantic, a voice from the
                    distant past …" (p. vi). Of course, the proper study of folklore includes an
                    examination of survivals of older ways of traditional life in modern society as well as an
                    investigation of contemporary folk culture, so it is to the editor's credit that she
                    included three articles on traditional material culture in her collection.</p>
            <p>Conspicuously lacking in this first section is any treatment of traditional-dwelling architecture in
                    Indiana. Excellent articles on traditional log architecture have been published in professional
                    journals, though not in <hi rend="i">Indiana Folklore;</hi> and this omission suggests the major
                    weakness of the anthology. Since the editor included only articles from <hi rend="i">Indiana
                        Folklore</hi>, the collection is not truly representative of the scholarship that has been done
                    on Hoosier folklore. The editor certainly acknowledges this shortcoming, however, for she writes:
                    "The anthology is necessarily incomplete and disproportionate because of the varying
                    quality of our resources. … For example, we could not include articles on proverbs,
                    riddles, ballads, jokes, life-cycle and calendar customs" (p. viii).</p>
            <pb n="62" id="VAA4025-078-1-068"/>
            <p>The other four sections, emphasizing beliefs and legends, are more typical of the content of the
                    state folklore journal. The second section, "Place Names and Oral History,"
                    includes one article on legends of two places called "Devil's Hollow"
                    near <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> and another article dealing with legends of "Hangman's
                    Crossing" and the Reno brothers from Seymour. The third section, "Folk Belief,
                    Medicine, and Magic," includes three articles dealing with the curative power of string
                    measurement in Indiana, with contemporary root doctors and psychics in the Calumet Region, and with
                    a seer from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Porter County</region>
                    </placeName>. The last two sections, "Horror Stories" and "Ghosts in the
                    House and on the Road," consist of seven representative articles on legends collected from
                    Hoosiers of all ages.</p>
            <p>The editor is relatively successful in achieving her objective of introducing "the general
                    reader to folklore as it is created, re-created, and circulated today among the people of
                    Indiana" (p. vi); however, while most of the material is of general interest, some of the
                    articles should have been edited for a general reading audience. The organization of some of the
                    articles as well as the abstracts of texts and unexplained abbreviated references and annotations,
                    although valuable to professional folklorists, will be confusing to general readers. The collection
                    certainly fills a need for a volume on Indiana folklore, however, and the very useful appended
                    bibliography of Indiana folklore, prepared by Nickolai Burlakoff and Carl Lin-dahl, lists 439 items
                    that will be of interest to the scholar as well as to the general reader of Indiana history and
                    culture.</p>

            <p>Untiring in his devotion to the documentary coverage of the Harmonist Society, Karl J. R. Arndt has
                    come out with another splendid volume. With his well-known editorial competence he offers in what he
                    conceives as the first volume of a <hi rend="i">Documentary History of George Rapp's
                        Harmony Society, 1700–1916</hi>, pertinent documents largely from the
                    Wûrttembergische Hauptstaatsarchiv and the Landeskirchliche Archiv Stuttgart. The present
                    book is an in-depth illustration of the intricate <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-078-1-069"/> relations
                    among representatives of established religion (Land-eskirche), pietists, separatists, and government
                    in the duchy of Wûrttemberg, <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, during the age of absolutism and enlightened despotism. The general background on
                    these issues is provided by the "Prolegomena" (pp. 1–62). This
                    introduction is followed by "The Evolution of Rapp's Separatism between 1785 and
                    1792" (pp. 63–226); "George Rapp's Separatist Church,
                    1793–1803" (pp. 227–353); and "Flight of Rapp's
                    Separatist Church to America, 1803–1805" (pp. 355–462). A useful
                    index concludes the work.</p>
            <p>Although in his other books Arndt presented all documents in English, this volume provides only short
                    English introductions to all chapters and subdivisions. With regard to language the
                    author's assumption that "the documents are too distinctly Swabian to be
                    translated into such a commercial language as American" (p. xxvii) is questionable. At any
                    rate, it takes graduate-level reading power to plow deeply into the eighteenth-century language of
                    German records, decrees, hearings, statutes, and contracts. For those who can read it, this book is
                    a gold mine for the study of the genesis of Harmonist separatism and the political mixture of
                    religious tolerance and intolerance in the time before the separation of church and state became a
                    reality in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Arndt's disappointment about the lack of Swabian financial support for his meritorious
                    publications on the Harmonists is understandable. But to brand Swabian "avarice"
                    and to speak of "a tragic moral decline … symbolized in the star of materialism
                    [Mercedes emblem] shining over the city [of Stuttgart]" in the introduction is most
                    regrettable. The few misprints found do not endanger meaning.</p>

            <p>Ray Allen Billington has left western scholars and students with a thought-provoking study as his
                    last contribution to a lifetime's research and writing on the American frontier. Moving
                    east, across the Atlantic to nineteenth-century Europe, he has turned his attention to the old
                    continent's view of the new country. Reading travelers' accounts, guidebooks,
                    "American <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-078-1-070"/> Letters," promotional literature of
                    land and railroad companies, propaganda circulated by territorial and state immigration agencies,
                    emigrant newspapers, and fiction published abroad, he proposes a dual image of a land of savagery
                    and a land of promise. Some Europeans "were convinced that the West was a forbidden
                    horror-land, where dense forests or parched deserts tested human frailty, where savage Indians and
                    bloodthirsty bandits lurked, where daily battles with bowie-knives and six-shooters took their toll;
                    and where unkempt squatters and tobacco-spitting pioneers mirrored the decay of civilization. Others
                    gained the impression that the frontier was a golden land of Promise, where untold riches waited the
                    industrious and where the humblest peasant could be transformed into a respected gentleman"
                    (p. 291). There are no means of ascertaining how Europeans handled such conflicting images.
                    Presumably they made up their own minds about what to believe depending partly on the nature and
                    timing of their reading and partly on their own cultural backgrounds. Whatever their final decisions
                    they certainly found the image-makers irresistibly appealing.</p>
            <p>Readers should also find this study appealing for it contains a wealth of information. Billington not
                    only spent several years working on the subject, but he also had the invaluable assistance of a
                    large team of European academics and translators. Indeed, the sources are so plentiful that at times
                    there is too much evidence and not enough analysis. The organization of the material also presents
                    problems. The dual images and their relationship to reality keep emerging in the discussion of
                    image-makers, the landscape, native Americans, pioneers, farmers, the western character, the use of
                    the land, equality, law and order, and European reactions, but it is difficult to place the findings
                    into a systematic framework. It is perhaps best to treat and to enjoy each topic separately.
                    Illustrations are liberally sprinkled throughout the volume. It is a pity that they were not better
                    integrated with the text and more stylishly reproduced. Despite these shortcomings <hi rend="i">Land
                        of Savagery, Land of Promise</hi> will become a standard reference book. The footnotes alone are
                    a godsend. It is hoped that the volume will also act as a "pilot study" to
                    "encourage other investigators, particularly in Europe, to dig more deeply into the
                    sources" (p. xv). There is evidently still much work to be done in exploring the American
                    frontier.</p>

            <p>Thousands of groups populated the American frontier from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries,
                    but few of them coalesced into stable and enduring communities. Robert V. Hine wants to know why.
                    Rejecting the traditional historical view of frontier life that touts individualism and
                    self-sufficiency as premier values, Hine adopts a perspective that values community. He examines
                    groups as diverse in goals, practices, and fates as <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> Puritans, Mexicans of Alta California, miners, utopians, vegetarians, and anarchists.
                    In general, he asks what factors promoted or undermined community development; in particular, what
                    attention was paid by specific groups to three essential characteristics of
                    community—sense of place, appropriate size, and values held in common.</p>
            <p>He finds a few legitimate communities (rather than accidental groupings or chance associations),
                    including the Mormons in the 1840s, German farm colonists in the 1870s, and <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> Puritans who "steadfastly practiced the highest levels of community that white
                    Americans have ever achieved …" (p. 33). Why these groups succeeded (at least
                    for a time) when others failed serves as a central theme of the book. Puritans realized the
                    importance of face-to-face relationships and "hived-off" when the population got
                    too large. The Mormons and the German farm groups kept their communities intact by stressing values
                    (social and/or religious) that affirmed the precedence of the group over the individual. All three
                    strengthened connections to the community by nurturing in its members an attachment to place.</p>
            <p>These three groups are, however, the exceptions. More often, community urges on the frontier fell
                    prey to wanderlust, boosterism, commitment to growth, abandonment of "old ways"
                    for new, the rise of subgroups, and the emergence of clearer class differences. Even under ideal
                    conditions cohesive and strong communities develop only with difficulty, and the American frontier,
                    Hine argues, exacerbated the difficulties by enhancing individualism. The frontier encouraged
                    mobility, individual land ownership, unlimited expansion, scores of get-rich-quick schemes, and the
                    dream of better opportunities just over the next hill. Most important, frontier individualism upset
                    the balance between group and individual that is crucial to the survival of the community.</p>
            <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-078-1-072"/>
            <p>Hine has written a thoughtful account of a topic too long overlooked. He applies a fresh perspective
                    to well-known information. The book does suffer from several problems because of Hine's
                    tendency to overlook nuance, detail, and complication. He compares groups across time without paying
                    attention to social and cultural changes over time. He draws too easy generalizations about groups.
                    Few colonial historians will accept his monolithic representation of Puritans. Most western
                    historians will reject portrayals of miners or women or any number of other groups that betray no
                    gradations or subtleties.</p>
            <p>Finally, although Hine has compiled a fascinating array of secondary works, novels, and published
                    reminiscences, his use of them is disconcerting. Reminiscences and novels offer rich information
                    unavailable elsewhere, but they cannot be taken at face value. They tell a particular kind of truth
                    and must be used with caution. Hine, however, uses scholarly, personal, fictional, and fanciful
                    accounts interchangeably, apparently interpreting one as valid as the next.</p>

            <p>Construction of public works projects has often required the assembling of people, equipment, and
                    materials at remote locations—the Panama Canal, Hoover Dam, Burma Road. This fine new
                    case study by John N. Dickinson portrays the trials of the promoters, workmen, and engineers who
                    constructed a canal to circumvent the falls of the St. Mary's River in the mid-1850s. Few
                    studies of nineteenth-century engineering construction offer such a lucid view of the "nuts
                    and bolts" of canal building. The book also contributes to an understanding of how the
                    quirks of geology, geography, and hydrology have enormous political, economic, and engineering
                    consequences.</p>
            <p>The canal was an effort to overcome one of nature's anomalies. Lake Superior exceeds Lake
                    Huron in elevation by some twenty-one feet, and most of the drop on the St. Mary's River,
                    which connects the two lakes, occurs in a three-fourths-mile-long stretch. Some 74,000 cubic feet of
                    water per <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-078-1-073"/> second roared along the rapids that effectively
                    blocked navigation between Superior and Huron. In the seventeenth century the French devised a
                    timber flume to facilitate the dragging of boats and cargo around the white water. A lock built by a
                    trading company in 1797 was destroyed by American troops in the War of 1812. The subsequent
                    discovery of rich sources of iron and copper ore in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> prompted action to provide a navigable waterway on this treacherous reach of the river.</p>
            <p>Dickinson carefully chronicles the convoluted story of the canal's gestation, especially the
                    negotiations between the state and federal governments with respect to the canal's funding
                    and construction. He also captures the eccentric character of Charles T. Harvey, who helped form the
                    St. Mary's Falls Ship Canal Company that was retained by the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> government to build the facility. The heart of the book relates the canal's
                    star-crossed construction. The project was somehow completed despite poor engineering, weak
                    construction management, labor disputes, serious epidemics, lawsuits, financial difficulties, and
                    political wrangling. The undertaking was often delayed because of inadequate numbers of skilled
                    workers, primitive construction equipment, and a host of other ills brought on by working some four

            <p>Ironically, the canal was a dismal disappointment to its builders. The rapid demand for iron did not
                    immediately occur after the canal was opened in 1855. The hopes of land speculators, who staunchly
                    supported the canal, were not realized. Once steel emerged as the foundation of American industry,
                    the canal became obsolete. The Army Corps of Engineers took over the facility in 1881 and
                    subsequently built one-lock canals that permitted the passage of larger ships.</p>

                    Resettlement Administration in order to relieve pressure on urban slums, Forest Park, or North
                    Greenhills as it was known <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-078-1-074"/> at the time, became a separate entity
                    in 1950. Planned by the <placeName>

                    communities, North Greenhills was designed to contain five self-sufficient neighborhoods of twelve
                    thousand to eighteen thousand homes each with central shopping and community facilities. Renamed
                    Forest Park in 1954, North Greenhills had its first residential area by 1956 and 4,800 residents by
                    1960. Under threat of annexation of parts of its land to <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1961, Forest Park incorporated as a village. It became a city in 1967 and, by 1970,
                    was the third largest city in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hamilton County</region>
                    </placeName>. Forest Park, like other suburban communities around <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the nation, had a highly transient population, but, unlike them, it consisted of a
                    larger percentage of persons who were white-collar, professional, cosmopolitan, and black than did
                    similar suburban areas.</p>
            <p>Hired by the Forest Park city council to write the community's history, Zane L. Miller not
                    only did a case study of planning and growth in this one atypical community but also analyzed social
                    attitudes concommitant with development. In a short passage in his introduction Miller details his
                    historical premises: that the past is a "series of discrete and discontinuous chronological
                    periods separated by shifts in the ways people characterize reality," that the historian
                    should first study social structure, and that next the historian should study social process. By
                    taking his own advice, Miller has created a periodization, based upon changing community definition,
                    of three social taxonomies in Forest Park. Created originally in a
                    period—1920–1950—-that Miller titles the
                    "metropolitan" mode, Forest Park was part of a strategy to encourage commitment to
                    the welfare of an entire metropolitan area, in this case <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Built and growing early in a period—1950–1965—-that
                    Miller dubs the "community of limited liability," Forest Park became a collection
                    of autonomous citizens whose devotion was limited by the claims of other communities. From 1965 on,
                    Forest Park was a "community of advocacy" characterized by claims for services by
                    disparate groups and by residents who felt no obligation for civic improvement, who had no concept
                    of general welfare, and who, while talking about civic interest, acted as if it did not exist.</p>
            <p>Miller has, in essence, written two books. One is a detailed urban history of the growth of Forest
                    Park, complete with conflicting interests of developers, residents, races, planners, and the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The other is an intellectual history <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-078-1-075"/> of the values
                    of suburban dwellers. Both books are successful and important. Unfortunately, combining the two
                    makes a volume that can, at times, be tedious, complex, and difficult to read. Despite these
                    caveats, however, <hi rend="i">Suburb</hi> is an important book.</p>

                    bibliography, index. $19.95.)</head>
            <p>Ulysses S. Grant has not suffered for want of biographers. Few men of his century were so written
                    about, while the present century has produced both the 1935 classic by William B. Hesseltine, <hi rend="i">Ulysses S. Grant, Politician</hi>, and the remarkable trilogy on Grant's
                    military career by Lloyd Lewis and Bruce Catton. Grant is worthy of such attention. He was the
                    greatest general of the nation's most terrible conflict and served as president for eight
                    of the nation's most critical years.</p>
            <p>William S. McFeely falls short of the mighty prose of Lewis and Catton and also fails to match the
                    brilliant political analysis of Hesseltine. He does, however, achieve something that his
                    predecessors failed to accomplish. His goal in writing <hi rend="i">Grant: A Biography</hi> was to
                    make this most representative of nineteenth-century Americans understandable—in human
                    terms—to today's generation. Americans, McFeely declares, "deserve to
                    know a man they would recognize if they met him in a crowd" (p. 522). McFeely's
                    triumph, and the great worth of this fine biography, is that Grant's heart and
                    mind—or at least the author's interpretation of them—are opened for
                    all to see. It is a melancholy revelation, and no one who reads this book can fail finally to have
                    compassion for this tragic, familiar man who "became general and president because he could
                    find nothing better to do" (p. xii).</p>
            <p>Strangely, for the biography of a great general, this book will hold few rewards for the military
                    historian or buff. McFeely's account of the war is essentially Russell Weigley's
                    strategy of annihilation interpretation. His few descriptions of battle are lackluster and give the
                    reader no true sense of just what was going on. There is hardly, for instance, one word on the
                    desperate fighting during those final days before Appomattox, while three pages are devoted to the
                    actual surrender. McFeely is not interested in the details of battle, only the results. He spends
                        <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-078-1-076"/> his narrative chronicling the man, Grant, not the carnage
                    that surrounded him. His point is to convey to the readers a sense of why "war, for a man
                    like Ulysses Grant, was the only situation in which he could truly connect to his country and
                    countrymen and be at one with them and with himself" (p. 68).</p>
            <p>McFeely, who wrote previously on Oliver 0. Howard and the Freedman's Bureau, has a special
                    concern for the plight of black Americans. His discussion of Grant's seemingly
                    inconsis-tant relationship to the people who viewed him as a liberator is among the high points of
                    the book. This emphasis on black history, however, occasionally leads the author away from his
                    subject. A twelve-page digression to discuss some eventually irrelevant 1865 peace negotiations
                    (with emphasis on their relation to the emancipated slaves) and a five-page discussion of early
                    attempts to integrate West Point are the most glaring examples. Such digressions would be
                    understandable if more important matters, such as the Appomattox campaign and the Belknap
                    impeachment, were not passed over too quickly.</p>
            <p>Such caveats notwithstanding, this book is worthy of the acclaim accorded it by the popular press.
                    McFeely succeeds admirably in presenting the roots of Grant's mighty successes and
                    monumental failures. The reader cannot fail to empathize with this most human of generals and
                    presidents. McFeely indeed makes Grant recognizable. This book will not replace Hesseltine or Lewis
                    and Catton, but room will most certainly have to be made for it on the shelf with them. McFeely has
                    clearly written the standard one-volume account of Grant's entire career.</p>

            <p>Was William McKinley a spineless politician who weakly succumbed to public pressure for a needless
                    war while serving as the compliant tool of big business and Mark Hanna, or was he a masterful
                    wartime leader who, as the first modem president, established important precedents for his
                    successors? Lewis L. Gould has assembled impressive evidence to refute the stereotyped view of
                    McKinley as simply a mediocre prelude to the dynamic Theodore Roosevelt. This interpretation of
                    McKinley as a strong president was first advanced twenty years ago <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-078-1-077"/> by Margaret Leech and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> Morgan in their biographies. Using some new sources but drawing heavily on their work,
                    Gould has reinforced this view while providing additional focus on the many ways in which McKinley
                    strengthened the powers of the presidential office. He has also produced an encyclopedic account of
                    the administration, an account rich in its insightful analysis of McKinley as decision-maker and
                    national leader.</p>
            <p>Foreign policy tended to dominate during the McKinley years because of the Spanish-American War, the
                    establishment of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as a colonial power, and the struggle for foreign markets. Gould demonstrates that
                    McKinley was the dominant figure in each of these far-reaching developments. The president utilized
                    telegraphic communications and his own White House staff to control the negotiations with <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>. When talk failed and war came, he used these same tools to set up an executive war
                    room from which he ruled as commander-in-chief in fact as well as title. McKinley set an unfortunate
                    precedent by initiating hostilities before Congress declared war and, again without consultation
                    with the legislature, made the crucial decision to dispatch troops to the Philippines. It was this
                    action that made it almost impossible for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to withdraw from the islands when the war ended. This involvement, in retrospect, made
                    the creation of an American empire inevitable. McKinley used firmness and patience to extract from <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> the peace terms that he had decided upon. The political skill and sensitivity that he
                    displayed in winning Senate approval for his very controversial peace treaty could have served as a
                    model for Woodrow Wilson.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The American Presidency</hi> series of which this volume is a part is composed of
                    synthesized studies based primarily on secondary literature. Gould, however, has also drawn on
                    original sources to examine McKinley's conduct of the presidential office. It is this facet
                    of the work that makes it a particularly significant contribution to an understanding of William
                    McKinley.</p>

                    Historical Association, 1981. Pp. 174. Illustrations, notes, index. $10.00.)</head>
            <p>In this third volume of a topical studies series by the Norweigan–American Historical
                    Association, Carl H. Chrislock <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-078-1-078"/> of Augsburg College examines the
                    public issues enveloping Norwegian-Americans of the "Upper Midwest" from 1914 to
                    1920. The geographic focus is on <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>,
                            <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
               </placeName>, the Dakotas, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, but the cultural and political problems discussed are useful for comparison with
                    ethnic groups in all regions of the country. While there are studies of German-speaking Americans
                    during the World War I years, such as Frederick Luebke's <hi rend="i">Bonds of Loyalty</hi>
                    (1974), Chrislock's study is one of the very few to examine the conflicting claims of
                    ethnicity and American nationality for an immigrant group from a neutral European nation. The
                    author's evidence is based heavily on the Norwegian-American press, Norwegian Lutheran
                    church records, and the personal papers gathered by the Norwegian-American Historical Society and
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Society.</p>
            <p>Perhaps not surprisingly, the issues and problems for Norwegian-Americans were similar to those of
                    German-Americans, which suggests that the difficulties of national assimilation were broadly
                    cultural as well as specifically political in nature. Norwegian-Americans were subject to attack in
                    the local presses of their settlement areas for their use of a non-English tongue, their presumed
                    lack of American loyalty, their associations and churches based exclusively on ethnic ties, and
                    their alleged proclivity for political radicalism. Also, like German-Americans, this Scandinavian
                    group experienced internal battles between assimilationists and ethnic conservatives fought out
                    within the Norwegian Lutheran church, in partisan political circles, among literary spokesmen, and
                    within the ethnic associations. Chrislock's study gives further evidence that the Red Scare
                    of 1919 and the postwar Americanization movement grew directly out of wartime attitudes and
                    emotions, although the seeds had been sown well before the war's outbreak.</p>
            <p>Chrislock's short book occasionally bogs down in political detail while neglecting the
                    personal social experience of Norwegian townfolk and farmers that might have breathed more vitality
                    into his account. As Chrislock acknowledges (p. 5), he does not bring tools of quantitative analysis
                    to his political discussion. At times the author wavers in his basic contention that the war was the
                    principal cause of the problems by noting that the social conditions of generational ethnic conflict
                    were well under way prior to 1914 and continued after "normalcy" returned to the
                    society. Intergenerational conflicts among Norwegian-Americans bear additional investigation. <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-078-1-079"/> Readers interested in Norwegian-Americans, ethnic assimilation
                    processes, or the social impact of twentieth-century wars will find valuable material from a freshly

            <p>Aileen S. Kraditor's book is a complex, provocative, but flawed study of three major
                    American radical organizations. She has examined closely the rhetoric of the Socialist party of
                    America, the Socialist Labor party, and the Industrial Workers of the World, focusing on the
                    radicals' perceptions of the American worker, nonwhites, women, capitalists, American
                    society, and themselves. In most cases the author, a former old leftist who seems to have followed
                    the well-worn path to the right, believes that the radicals' perceptions were wrong. They
                    were blind to the real concerns of workers, not sufficiently cognizant of the special problems of
                    nonwhites and women, and erroneous in their claim that American <hi rend="i">society</hi> was really
                    a <hi rend="i">system</hi> in the viselike grip of ruthless capitalists.</p>
            <p>Kraditor also contends that radical organizations served as ends as well as means; i.e., that they
                    "functioned as surrogate communities for people who did not feel themselves integral parts
                    of ethnic, religious, or neighborhood communities" (p. 276). In this role they apparently
                    served an important purpose for their members; but as for converting the worker, they did not have a
                    chance. The worker was too wrapped up in his family, ethnic community, and church or synagogue to be
                    enticed away by Socialists or Wobblies who did not understand him. The radicals assumed that the
                    worker was alienated but was too oppressed to know, Kraditor claims. "In reality, he was
                    not alienated, and hence they offered him a solution to a problem he did not have; they had to make
                    him feel alienated and <hi rend="i">then</hi> offer him their movement as the cure for his
                    condition. But, not having the disease, he did not need the medicine" (p. 284).</p>
            <p>Although Kraditor asks provocative questions, her answers are not always satisfactory. That the
                    American worker did not <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-078-1-080"/> respond to the radicals in large numbers
                    is, of course, obvious. That they did not respond because their needs were not accurately perceived
                    by the radicals is not convincingly shown by Kraditor. So much depends on the <hi rend="i">workers'</hi> perceptions, which Kraditor acknowledges but does not thoroughly
                    explore, that it is difficult to accept, without further evidence, the view that the worker was not
                    alienated—that he was content in the bosom of family, community, church.</p>
            <p>Kraditor seems to want her readers to accept this book as a more objective study of American
                    radicalism than is usually written. Since historians of radical movements have heretofore tended to
                    write from the perspective of the political extremes, one is more than ready to do so. <hi rend="i">The Radical Persuasion</hi>, however, is not the book Kraditor claims it is; it becomes
                    apparent early in the volume that the radicals are not going to receive evenhanded treatment.</p>
            <p>One cannot do justice to so rich a book in so short a review. If this review appears too negative, it
                    is because the book promised so much more than it produced. Although it does fall short of
                    expectations, <hi rend="i">The Radical Persuasion</hi> remains an insightful, important work that
                    must not be missed by any student of the American radical experience.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">One Third of a Nation</hi> is the second book in the last two years to focus on the life
                    and career of Lorena Hickok, a journalist, reporter, and publicist for the Democratic National
                    Committee, and close friend of Eleanor Roosevelt. Unlike Doris Faber's <hi rend="i">The
                        Life of Lorena Hickok</hi> (1980), which deals primarily with Hickok's relationship
                    with Mrs. Roosevelt, <hi rend="i">One Third of a Nation</hi> centers on her role as an investigative
                    field reporter for Harry Hopkins and the Federal Emergency Relief Association in
                    1933–1934.</p>
            <p>While employed by FERA, Hickok interviewed thousands of citizens and government and political leaders
                    about the effects of the Depression and the newly instituted federal relief programs. She related
                    these findings in hundreds of letters and reports sent to Hopkins, Aubrey Williams, and Eleanor <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-078-1-081"/> Roosevelt. Ninety-three of these letters and reports, taken from
                    the Lorena Hickok and Harry Hopkins papers at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library, comprise this
                    volume. These letters, dating from August, 1933, through January 1, 1935, describe in elaborate
                    detail the economic and social conditions caused by the Depression. For this reason <hi rend="i">One
                        Third of a Nation</hi> is a valuable contribution to the literature on the New Deal era.</p>
            <p>Preceding Hickok's letters is a lengthy and well-documented introduction by Richard Lowitt
                    and Maurine Beasley, who edited the correspondence. It adds much to the reader's
                    understanding of the background and content of Hickok's letters. Twenty-two pages of
                    photographs supplement the work and provide visual support for Hickoks assessment of the
                    Depression's tragic impact on the American people.</p>
            <p>The importance of Hickok's correspondence lies in the insight she provides into the
                    deteriorating morale of citizens left destitute and homeless and into the benefits and limitations
                    of federal relief programs that were designed to alleviate these problems. Her letters speak of
                    bankrupt businesses, farmers plagued with severe droughts and falling prices, minorities suffering
                    from increased poverty and discrimination, and workers with large families and no jobs. These are
                    not new revelations, but Hickok's firsthand accounts have a more personal impact. Equally
                    important is what Hickok has to say about federal relief programs. Her letters highlight many of the
                    problems still associated with the relief system today, including inefficiency, inequality of
                    benefits, corruption, patronage, and politics. This was the beginning of the federal relief system,
                    and her observations on these issues are worthy of consideration.</p>
            <p>Hickok's interviews and reports did have a political purpose; namely, to gauge public
                    opinion toward the president and his programs. Ironically, some of her predictions and concerns in
                    this area proved premature and incorrect. Her frequent claim that Roosevelt was in trouble
                    politically in many states and her fear that left-wing protest groups would make vast inroads with
                    the voting populace turned out to be inaccurate and exaggerated.</p>
            <p>Specialists in Indiana history will be disappointed to find that there are no letters about the
                    Hoosier state in this volume, nor are there any concerning <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. The editors might have explained the reasoning behind Hickok's itinerary and
                    why some states were omitted. This is a minor point, however, and does not detract from this
                    compilation of important primary <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-078-1-082"/> source material. <hi rend="i">One Third of a Nation</hi> should prove valuable to economic, social, and political historians
                    of the twentieth century.</p>

            <p>Since 1950 over three million people have migrated from Appalachia to the cities of the South, East,
                    and Midwest. This population shift is a folk movement on a vast scale, comparable to the immigration
                    of the Irish, Italians, and Puerto Ricans. The literature of American immigration history is
                    voluminous; yet, for a variety of reasons, this great movement of Appalachians has gone largely
                    unstudied. The result is that "so little actual research has been done that no one really
                    knows what happened to the 3.3 million people who left the Appalachian region nor what problems and
                    contributions were created in the cities which were the receiving centers" (p. 3).</p>
            <p>The Academy for Contemporary Problems and the Urban Appalachian Council sought to encourage research
                    in this neglected area by organizing a conference for Appalachian specialists. The meeting was held
                    in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, in March, 1974. Most of the chapters <hi rend="i">of Invisible
                        Minority</hi> were originally presented as papers at this conference, though some have been
                    revised in light of developments in the intervening years, and two papers have been written since
                    that time.</p>
            <p>The editors have collected ten papers which deal with various aspects of the life of urban
                    Appalachians. Two papers deal with Appalachians as an urban ethnic group; four study patterns of
                    migration to urban areas; and another four evaluate the attainments of Appalachians who have moved
                    to the city. An introduction and a conclusion help to focus and summarize the various contributions.
                    The book will be of great interest to Appalachian specialists. The papers selected for inclusion
                    deal with the major issues and point out areas that need further research. One can only hope that
                    the institutions that must cope with the presence of urban Appalachians will be enabled to perform
                    their tasks more effectively as a result of this kind of research.</p>

            <p>The value of many sociological monographs would be greater if the authors had written them in
                    English. The essays in this volume do not deserve such criticism, and yet the need for better
                    writing is painfully apparent. The faults of much scholarly prose, particularly in the social
                    sciences, obscure the authors' contributions. There are a number of books that all aspiring
                    writers should read, mark, and inwardly digest. The most important of these, perhaps, is William
                    Strunk and E. B. White's <hi rend="i">Elements of Style</hi> which stresses the stern but
                    valuable admonition: omit needless words. The size even of this slender volume would have been
                    reduced and its impact increased had this dictum been heeded.</p>

            <p>The first five essays provide a variety of insights into the development of woodworking tools, their

                    cautioned that this is the case. Hummel, for example, supports a generalization concerning
                    woodworkers' activities before 1840 by referring to the availability of materials in the
                    city of <placeName>

            <p>Since the mid-1960s the practice of oral history has experienced remarkable growth, chiefly (but not
                    exclusively) among groups and individuals who are not associated with the academic world. Oral
                    history is said to be particularly useful in the retrieval of local history and of the history and
                    experiences of minorities, of immigrant groups, of labor, and of that overwhelming majority of
                    mankind that is systematically ignored in more traditional forms of research. Many claim to be
                    "doing oral history"; the historical societies, libraries, high schools, and
                    colleges that have oral history projects are numerous. Just as numerous are the definitions of the
                    activity. Neither of the books under consideration contributes to any clarification of
                    "oral history," but both offer valuable insight into the general process of
                    recording and collecting information from oral sources.</p>
            <p>Edward D. Ives has written a useful manual that includes concise and informative chapters on
                    interviewing and the processing of interviews. Of particular worth is his proposition that the most
                    effective interview is the one consciously conducted as <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-078-1-085"/> a
                    trialogue, with the recorder as the third party. In the choice of recorder, however, Ives makes some
                    dubious assertions supporting reel-to-reel equipment operated in its battery-powered mode. The
                    modern cassette recorder compares favorably to the reel-to-reel in portability, reliability, and in
                    reproduction of human speech, and some of the best can be had for one tenth the price of a Uher
                    4000. Certainly Ives has had great success with his equipment and techniques, but for reasons
                    related primarily to expense and utility the average project would be well advised to use cassette
                    recorders.</p>
            <p>While Ives addresses the problems and the potential of the tape-recorded interview exclusively, Allen
                    and Montell broaden the scope of their attention to include any oral expression, whether taped or
                    not. <hi rend="i">From Memory to History</hi> is a rationale for the collection of "orally
                    communicated history" on the local level, accompanied by suggestions for identification and
                    analysis of the information so collected. As early as page three the authors have made it clear that
                    they really mean oral tradition when they refer to orally communicated history. Confusing
                    terminology notwithstanding, they make a strong case for increased attention to lore and tradition
                    in the research and writing of local histories.</p>
            <p>It is this theme of oral communication as a source of lore and tradition that <hi rend="i">From
                        Memory to History</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Tape-Recorded Interview</hi> have in common, and
                    both books handle the theme capably. Readers interested in recording other, perhaps equally
                    enlightening, versions of the past have recourse to several excellent works cited in the
                    bibliographies. Both books are by folklorists; consequently, it is not surprising that neither has
                    much to offer on the subject of the taped, oral account as a primary source in the understanding and
                    writing of history. Instead, "oral history" and "orally communicated
                    history" are charged with folkloric meaning, accompanied by the required expressions of
                    "non-elitist" orientation (Ives, p. xii) and "what people believe
                    happened is often as important as what actually happened" (Allen, Montell, p. 89).</p>
            <p>Most oral history projects in Indiana are engaged primarily in efforts to determine and understand
                    the reality of the past at the local and state level. Often, researchers already know what people
                        <hi rend="i">believe</hi> happened; they would like to find out what <hi rend="i">actually</hi>
                    happened. Ives's, Allen's, and Montell's interests lie elsewhere.</p>

            <p>Bibliographies are needed for all levels of libraries and teaching. This volume is a revision of John
                    E. Wiltz's 1964 publication, one of the few written for the high school and junior college.
                    Although Nancy C. Cridland attempted to retain as many titles as possible, the changes in publishing
                    cause a nearly 50 percent turnover. Reflecting the flow of professional interests, books dealing
                    with women, Chicanos, native Americans, and environmental works are now included, and black history
                    is expanded. Where possible, paperbacks have been favored, and a small amount of historical fiction
                    is now listed. New is a brief chapter on reference and review sources for nonprint media.</p>
            <p>Composed of under four hundred titles, the work is similar in length to the bibliographies of high
                    school textbooks but has better annotations, lists more paperbacks, and is easier to use. Some
                    textbooks, however, give more information about reading level. Use as a checklist for the librarian,
                    concerned parent, or school board member is facilitated by the chapter "One Hundred
                    Selected Titles." Both editions, if followed, would create a rich library for American
                    history students.</p>
            <p>A few minor errors were noted. <hi rend="i">The Growth of the American Republic</hi> is now authored
                    by Samuel Eliot Morison, Henry S. Commager, and William E. Leuchtenburg. Frederick Bancroft, not
                    Thomas A., wrote <hi rend="i">Slave Trading in the Old South</hi>. One book that is listed is
                    already out of print. Because of the fleeting nature of paperbacks, prospective users should
                    probably purchase the cheaper version of this book and hope that fewer than seventeen years pass
                    before a new edition appears.</p>

                    guide to the Calumet Region is an unmatched aid to the local historian. Trusty lists the libraries,
                    archives, and historical societies in the Calumet and indicates the nature and special features of
                    their local history collections. He includes also a good list of theses, dissertations, and research
                    papers and a bibliography of published accounts, organized by subject. Not only is the guide the
                    essential starting point for every researcher, it is also testimony to the vitality and excitement
                    of local history in Indiana's most varied and perhaps most interesting area. <hi rend="i">James H. Madison, Indiana University, <placeName>

                    printing, according to the introduction to this pamphlet, "is a mostly noncommercial
                    attempt at fine bookmaking with a personal touch essentially for aesthetic satisfaction without a
                    primary profit motive" (p. ix). The private press movement began in <placeName>

                    booklet—a letter written by Booth Tarkington—in 1944 on a 3 × 5
                    Kelsey Excelsior platen hand press. Almost forty years and a number of presses later he is still
                    privately printing a variety of items, several on quality paper that he produces himself. As the
                    title indicates, this pamphlet is a catalog of an exhibit that was held at the University of

                    items for possible inclusion. We are especially interested in listing publications that make some
                    contribution to understanding Indiana's past but are not normally reviewed in the IMH.
                    Generally, we will not list newspaper articles or accounts of local historical society activities
                    (which are reported in the <hi rend="i">Indiana History Bulletin</hi>), but printed pamphlets as
                    well as journal articles may be listed. All such items for the March, 1983, issue must be received
                    by December 1, 1982. Many people have contributed to the present list, but major responsibility has
                    rested with Robert G. Barrows of the Indiana Historical Bureau and Gary L. Bailey of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>.</p>
