            Dann Lynn was a delegate from 
                        Posey County
                     to Indiana Territory's constitutional convention in 1816. He was elected from 
                        Posey County
                     to serve in the Indiana House of Representatives in 1816, reelected in 1817, and again
                    in 1819.1 Lynn operated the ferry across the Ohio River
                    above Diamond Island, now West 
                  Franklin, Indiana
               , and he died of cholera in 1833 at West 
                        Franklin
                    , Marrs Township, in 
                        Posey County
                    .2 Very few other facts have been recorded about him, and there seem
                    to be no diaries or similar memorabilia.3
            
            During the late nineteenth century William H. English, Indiana politician, banker, and author,
                    attempted to discover some additional facts about Lynn. Two letters in the English Collection,
                    located in the Indiana Historical Society Library in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , form the basis for many of the facts and much of the conjecture about this early
                    Indiana settler.4

                        Houston, Texas
                     , and is

                     3 It should be noted that when Dann Lynn spelled out his given name or
                            when papers were prepared by people who knew him, his first name was always spelled
                            "Dann," and it appears in this form on the Indiana Constitution of 1816.

                     4 William H. English apparently intended to compile a book of
                            biographies of Indiana legislators and collected considerable material toward that end.
                            Although the book was never published, the papers which English amassed are located in the
                            William H. English Collection (Indiana Historical Society Library,

                     Current attempts to verify the leads contained in the two
                    letters have not only unearthed much information about Lynn but have also revealed considerable
                    interesting material about life in pioneer Indiana and about the methods and rewards of research
                    into family history.
            In 1889 Edward A. Pitts, grandson of Dann's brother, Pitts Lynn, wrote to English about his
                    great uncle:

                                    in 1832 with cholera and was buried on the hill known as Lynn's family
                                    Graveyard only his immediate family being there buried His family consisted of eight
                                    (8) Daughters and Four (4) Sons all of whom are dead. His occupation was that of a
                                    farmer and trader and was a man of considerable wealth at one time consisting of Cheap Land and Slaves. Being a Slaveholder in 
                                        Kentucky
                                     he brought his Slaves to the then Territory. After the territory was
                                    admitted as a State he liberated them, they being the greater part of his wealth, at
                                    that time. He represented the county in the Legislature. He was also a member of the
                                    Constitutional Convention of 1816. The 1st Court ever held in the County was at
                                    Absalon Duckworth's house on the 20th of March 1815, and was presided over
                                    by Dann Lynn with Thomas E. Casselberry and Isaac Bradley as associates. His
                                    Politics was Democratic, was a very sociable man, also very charitable, not only
                                    with his money, but in his business, always willing to concede to all the privilege
                                    of differing, without disputing their rights to their opinion. He was firm and
                                    consciencious in all his dealings. Education limited but possessed a vast amount of
                                    common sense.

                                     Ind
                        Dear Sir:
                        I have your letter of the 20th and would be pleased if I could fully comply with your
                                    request— Dann Lynn came to this locality sometime between 1806 and 1808,
                                    from 
                                        Caswell County
                                        North Carolina
                                    — He died with the Cholera in this County in 1833, one son
                                    and daughter dying in the same house about the same time—
                        He was quiet, cautious and very politic man, and with a fair English Education, and
                                    was a natural leader of men— This is about all that can be said about
                                    him, except what your Journals will show, in regard to his political career. It is
                                    said that after he was elected representative of this County, he refused to go to
                                    meet the General Assembly, and took a boat load of corn to 
                                        New Orleans
                                    — Old men say, this County may never before or since, [have
                                    been] so ably represented as when Dann Lynn went to 
                                        New Orleans
                                    — Lynn must have been about sixty years old at the time of
                                    his death— I regret that I cannot give you a better sketch of his
                                    life— He died poor and some of his descendants are still living in this
                                    County— He is said to have been a cousin of Senator Lynn of 
                                        Missouri
                                    
                        
                        
                                    Yours truly in haste
                                    Alvin P. Hovey6
                           
                                
                     
                  
                Although search in 
                  Caswell County, North Carolina
               , has not turned up Lynn family
                    footprints, the Hovey letter is of interest in other respects because the general, born September 6,
                    1821, and his family certainly would have known Lynn.7
            
            There is a good possibility, as Hovey's letter suggests, that Lynn was a flatboat operator
                    and river pilot and made many trips to 
                        New Orleans
                    . In a history of 
                        Posey County
                    , published in 1882, William P. Leonard wrote: "Wm. Hunter, in 1810, at the
                    present site of the town of

                    , built and launched the first flatboat that ever carried produce

                             never having been so well represented in the Legislature as the year her
                            Representative, Dann Lynn, went off to

                            understood as a good natured joke, since General Hovey was himself a member and

                    on account of his great fear of the earthquakes referred to above, sold it to Wm. McAdoo, his
                    father-in-law, who went South with pork and corn in the winter of the year 1811."8 Another early resident of 
                        Posey County
                     elaborates on this same story and ties it to Lynn: "It is more likely that
                    this William McAdoo was the father-in-law of Dann Lynn, or at least some relative of his wife, Ann
                    Elizabeth McAdoo."9

               , and
                    Taylor's presumed partner, a Captain Lynn. On May 13, 1805, for example, Wier wrote to John
                    Clay in 
                        New Orleans
                    : "I have shipped on board Taylor and Lynns boat and consigned to you 66 bales
                    and 5 hogsheads spun yarn and 60 coils bailing rope as requested January." Also, on July 3,
                    1805, Wier wrote to Taylor: "I expect eer this, there is at the lower landing (including
                    the had not sent on) twenty nine hhds spun yarn and nineteen coils white rope which I wish shipped
                    to

            Pitts' letter to English also contains possible, and perhaps more accurate, clues concerning
                    Lynn's life. For example, the birth date of January 24, 1782, as suggested by Pitts, may be
                    correct since the great nephew may have had access to a Bible record or since someone in his family
                    may have remembered the date. Pitts may also have been correct about Lynn's place of birth.

               ,
                    on January 23, 1800, when court met and ordered him to attend the next court as a juror.11 He did serve as a juror at the April term of court, and, if his birth was
                    indeed in 1782, he was only eighteen years old.12 In fact, through 1804, Lynn
                    continues to be mentioned prominently in 
                        Robertson County
                     official records. On March 25, 1800, William McAdoo, for the consideration of two
                    hundred dollars, deeded to Lynn seventy-four acres in 
                        Robertson County
                     on the South Fork of Red River, part of 274 acres granted McAdoo

                        North Carolina
                     July 11, 1788.13 On January 10, 1802, Lynn deeded this seventy-four
                    acres to his father, James Lynn, Sr., who was then living in 
                  Logan
                            County, Kentucky
               .14 In the October, 1802, term of court, Lynn sued John Towers,15 and
                    he was sued by William P. Anderson in May, 1804.16 One unexplained court action
                    took place in July, 1803, when allowances of $1.50 each were ordered for Daniel McKinley,
                    Jr., David Jones, Jr., James Appleton, Jr., and Thomas Appleton for guarding one "Dan Lynn

                        Tennessee
                     is unknown. On March 4, 1804, the Lynns' twin daughters, Margaretta and Polly,
                    were born on Red River.18 However, before April 1, 1806,
                    Lynn had moved to 
                  Henderson County, Kentucky
               , for on that date he sued Robert Byers for trespass

                    history of 
                        Posey County
                    , Lynn was at Diamond Island, Indiana, as early as 1807.20 There is
                    no evidence, however, that Lynn received a deed to property in Indiana before March 14, 1815.21 Nevertheless, he had become a well established citizen by September 14, 1814,
                    when he was appointed associate judge of the newly created 
                        Posey County
                    .22 Lynn Township was formed and named for him in January, 1817.23
            
            Lynn had apparently been among a number of citizens who were interested in getting the Indiana
                    territorial assembly to lay out a new county between 
                        Vincennes
                    , the territorial capital, and the Wabash River. In 1814 a
                    religious society of Germans under George Rapp and his adopted son, Frederick, had purchased land on
                    the 
                        Wabash
                    , some twenty-five miles above where it flows into the 
                        Ohio
                    , with the intention of founding a settlement there.24 On September
                    21, 1814, G. Michael Friz, a member of the society, wrote to Frederick Rapp, who was still at the
                    group's old headquarters in Harmony, 
                        Pennsylvania

                            office of presiding judge, but the records which have been found show that Lynn was never
                            higher than an associate. See, for example, Dann Lynn to Thomas Posey, August [?], 1816,

                        When we arrived here we attracted a great deal of attention among the people. The
                                    inhabitants between Wincins [
                                        Vincennes
                                    ] and the 
                                        Ohio
                                     were much interested in laying out the county. They came to us divided
                                    into three parties to get our votes. We examined the matter and discovered their
                                    intentions. We therefore gave our votes to a man known to us as honest, a judge
                                    named Linn, according to whose plan the courthouse would have been built 7 miles
                                    from our town, but what happened? The other parties opposed this one and it lost.
                                    Now the courthouse came near the 
                                        Ohio
                                     and the county line runs right through our land.25
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            As indicated in Friz' letter, when the Indiana territorial assembly organized 
                        Posey County
                    , effective November 1,1814, at least half the land belonging to the Harmony Society lay
                    in 
                        Gibson County
                    , north of Posey. Although later, in 1815, the boundary between the two counties was
                    adjusted northward and the town of 
                        New Harmony
                     was thus transferred to 
                  Posey County, Blackford
               , near the Ohio River,
                    remained the county seat.26 After Indiana achieved statehood, Lynn, as a
                    representative from 
                        Posey County
                     in the General Assembly, continued to work diligently to have the county seat moved to
                    a more central location. Lynn's letters to Frederick Rapp concerning this project reveal
                    the legislator's close association with the Harmonists.27
            
            Indeed, George Rapp's Harmony Society was an important force in southern Indiana's
                    history and therefore had an important influence on Lynn's political life. Originally from
                    Wurtemberg, 
                        Germany
                    , the Harmonists stopped for ten years at Harmony, 
                  Butler County, Pennsylvania
               ,
                    before moving to Indiana Territory in 1814. Soon after their arrival on the 
                        Wabash
                     the society built schools and a church; opened farms; planted orchards and vineyards;
                    built factories to produce broadcloth, tinware, shoes, saddles, flour, beer, and other commodities;
                    and carried on extensive commerce with firms and individuals for miles around. By the spring of 1815
                    the settlement of 
                        New Harmony
                     had between eight hundred and a

                            Lynn's efforts were eventually successful. In May 1817, 
                                Posey County
                             was again enlarged at the expense of Gibson, and the county seat of Posey moved
                            from 
                                Blackford
                             to 
                                Springfield
                            , which was located on one hundred acres of land donated by the Harmonists for
                            that purpose. Pence and Armstrong, Indiana Boundaries, 684–85;

                             as the name of the county seat in honor of his former residence in
                                    
                        Robertson County, Tennessee
                     .
               
                     thousand persons.28 Considering that the
                    official census of 
                        Posey County
                     in December, 1815, showed a total of 1,619 persons, of whom 320 were white males of
                    twenty-one and upwards,29 Lynn's need for the political support of the
                    Harmony Society members is clear; and he seems to have kept his political fences mended.
            Lynn's easy, trusting relationship with the Harmonists is reflected in the letter he wrote
                    to Frederick Rapp from Corydon, the state capital, on January 5, 1818:

                        Dr. Sir
                        Yours I read, by mail. I have been at the point of death but thanks to Heaven I am
                                    much mended I lay for nine days without one drop of nurishment never did one
                                    mouthful of any kind of food whatever for the time mentioned enter my mouth. The
                                    Doctors took me through a regular course of Sollovation the only remedy and last
                                    resort. I am trying to pay off the Doctors but find it will be hard to do for it
                                    appears money is the object. I wish to inform you of the Bill for relief of Thomas
                                    E. Casslberry the bill brought before the house contemplated to remove Colo. Love
                                    and give the Clerkship to Casselberry and in that shape it passed the low house and
                                    was taken up in the Senate and is there yet though I am of opinion it will be so
                                    amended as to order a New Election altogether. The militia Bill is now before the
                                    house and from its length I think it will take a week to pass it. We are trying to
                                    remedy some defects in the Bill, all those concientiously scruplas We want to place
                                    them on an equal footing with other Militia men and give them a chance to make their
                                    Excuse if there be any from home on business or sick give them a chance to make
                                    their Excuse is what we are trying at. I am rather of opinion the Bill will pass in
                                    that way. Colo. Neeley has forwarded to the speaker a letter setting forth you are
                                    Germans and will not give a fair list of your Militia men. If I mistake not on
                                    hearing the letter in house he says Mr. Jones applied to you for a list of names and
                                    you refused to give him a list &c. by which no fines could be collected,
                                    &c. &c. The Session is drawing to a close. I will only add Colo.
                                    Boon has come out as a candidate for the senate at the next Election.

                     is recovering. He (Lynn) makes a good member [of the House of

            Another letter in the Harmonist collection further clarifies Lynn's political career. In
                    1937 historian John D. Barnhart cited Lynn as a supporter of Territorial Governor William Henry
                    Harrison and his coterie of 
                        Virginia
                     aristocrats as opposed to Jonathan Jennings, territorial delegate to Congress and later
                    first governor of Indiana, and his followers.32 Barnhart's conclusion
                    may have derived from Lynn's having brought slaves into Indiana Territory and from the
                    belief that it was Dann Lynn whom Governor Harrison had appointed captain of the militia of 
                        Dearborn County
                     in 1803.33 A letter from James P. Drake, county clerk of 
                        Posey County
                    , however, suggests that Lynn may have been aligned with Jennings:

            In addition to the Harmonist documents, the journals of the Indiana Constitutional Convention of 1816
                    and of the Indiana House of Representatives provide interesting, though sketchy, information
                    concerning Lynn's political character. Lynn was not, of course, supported by all the voters
                    of 
                        Posey County
                    . In fact, his first election as delegate to the constitutional convention was contested
                    by Peter Wilkinson.35 The convention's committee of elections decided
                    that Lynn had been legally chosen, and he was appointed to the "Committee relative to
                    education, and the universal dissemination of useful knowledge, and other objects which it may be
                    proper to enjoin or recommend to the legislature to provide for.36 Although
                    another Hoosier legislator, speaking one hundred years later, classified Lynn as one of the members
                    of the committee on education "whose letters still in existence prove that they could
                    neither spell conventionally nor express themselves grammatically,"37
                    Lynn's extant correspondence seems quite typical for his time. Indeed, it could be
                    conjectured that the 
                        Posey County
                     delegate's contemporaries considered him well educated for his day, hence his
                    appointment to the committee on education. Whatever the truth of the matter Lynn apparently attended
                    and voted regularly during the convention sessions.
            A careful perusal of the state legislative journals for the three sessions during which Lynn served
                    as representative from 
                        Posey County
                     also reveals a conscientious legislator who by today's standards might be
                    called "liberal." Lynn voted for granting divorces to three of the four couples
                    petitioning; he was for the formation of new counties; for good roads; for good wages for the clerks
                    employed by the House and for judges; for lotteries to pay for erecting bridges, seminaries, and
                    libraries; and he was against any civil officer holding any office in any bank in the state and
                    against electing or appointing any member of the legislature to the office of circuit judge,
                    auditor, or treasurer of the state.38 As a state

                     legislator Lynn frequently served on committees providing for
                    the organization and regulation of the court system in Indiana, considering the formation of new
                    counties, and providing for various facets of county government, as well as on all committees
                    relative to 
                        Posey County
                    . Other assignments included service on committees discussing the disposal of public
                    lands granted to the state by the federal government and the alteration of laws relative to public
                    roads and highways.39
            
            Lynn apparently retired from politics following the 1818–1819 legislative session, before
                    the Harmonists sold their entire holdings to philanthropist Robert Owen of 
                        Scotland
                     and before the county seat of 
                        Posey County
                     was moved to 
                        Mount Vernon
                     on the Ohio River, both in 1825.40
                    Lynn's relations with the Owen communal experiment at 
                        New Harmony
                     are unknown, as is his role in moving the county seat. Lynn had, however, evidently
                    disposed of any lots he wished to sell in 
                        Springfield
                     before the move to 
                        Mount Vernon
                    ; at least, his name does not appear on the list of citizens who recovered damages when
                    the legislature passed an act early in May, 1827, for "relief of property owners"
                    because the seat of government had moved away.41
            
            Throughout his tenure as state legislator Lynn had continued to keep Frederick Rapp informed of
                    pending legislation of interest to the Harmony Society and to ascertain the society's
                    opinion about various political matters.42 Apparently Lynn also had business
                    dealings with the Harmonists, as, for example, when he gave Rapp first chance to buy the ferry at
                    Diamond Island.

                                    you would secure the fraction above, &c.
                        I am sir yours &c.

                This business venture did not materialize; Lynn retained the ferry and moved his family to
                    nearby West 
                  Franklin, Indiana
               , before the 1830 federal census was recorded.44 Another "good neighbor" opportunity arose when Frederick Rapp was
                    equipping one boat to carry flour and pork to 
                        New Orleans
                     and wanted a second one. On that occasion Lynn agreed to sell his boat and pork, as
                    Rapp reported to John L. Baker, the local merchant who was in 
                        St. Louis
                     on business.45
            
            Lynn's association with Frederick Rapp and the Harmonists, as revealed in their
                    correspondence, corroborates Pitts' assertion that Lynn was sociable and charitable to his
                    friends and constituency. Such pleasantness, however, apparently did not lead to financial success,
                    although Lynn did have sources of income not available to everyone of that day. He was, for example,
                    allowed thirty-five dollars at the November, 1815, term of court for his duties as associate judge.
                    The number of months he worked for this thirty-five dollars is not known; but, on May 14, 1817, he
                    was allowed only twelve dollars for the full year 1816.46 During the
                    constitutional convention he received two dollars per day and two dollars for each twenty-five miles
                    traveled to and from Corydon and from and to his place of residence by the most usual road.47 He received like remuneration during the three sessions he served in the
                    Indiana legislature.48
            
            After August 11, 1817, when Lynn applied for and was granted permission to keep a ferry across the
                        Ohio River above Diamond Island,49 he must have had the
                    income from

                    many eastern families began to move West, and most of these settlers probably carried enough hard
                    cash to pay for ferrying their livestock, personal belongings, and families across major streams.
                    The ferry rates for 
                        Posey County
                     had been set at the January, 1815, term of the commissioner's court, and each
                    ferry operator was allowed to charge for each wagon, one hundred cents; for each horse, twelve and a
                    half cents; for each man and horse, twenty-five cents; for each head of neat cattle and each
                    footman, twelve and a half cents; and for each man "that may cross said River between the
                    1st day of January and first day of April," thirty-seven and a half cents.50
            
            Even though an associate judge, a state representative, and the operator of a ferry should have had
                    cash money, Lynn's fortunes seemed to ebb and flow. On May 25, 1818, he paid off a six
                    months note for $129.50 which he had borrowed from Frederick Rapp only seventeen days
                        before.51 At least he kept his credit good with this influential voter. At
                    the September, 1818, term of the 
                        Posey County
                     Circuit Court, however, William P. Robinson and Darius North complained "of
                    Daniel Lynn who signs his name Dann Lynn" that he had received $150 in advance
                    and had agreed under penalty of $300 to deliver pork. They accused Lynn of
                    "contriving and fradulently intending craftily and subtilly to cheat and defraud"
                    them. The case was settled on March 8, 1819, when Lynn recovered his costs and charges.52 Later, between 1820 and 1830, after he was no longer in the legislature, Lynn
                    was sued for debts at least eight times and sued others twice.53 He filed a
                    declaration August 15, 1821, requesting further credit on the remaining balance he owed the Indiana
                    land office at 
                        Vincennes
                     on the land at West 
                        Franklin
                     which he had taken over from Lawrence Stull,54 but this was fairly
                    standard among debtors to the land office in those days.
            Quite aside from Lynn's income and list of debts, one is reminded by the following note to

                        New Harmony

            Since Pitts describes Lynn as having at one time been a man of considerable wealth consisting of
                    cheap land and slaves, Lynn's attitude toward slavery must also be considered. A man who
                    was quick to sue, who was often sued by others, and who obviously felt at home in the courts would
                    have been expected to record legally the freeing of his slaves, if, indeed, he brought more than one
                    with him from 
                        Kentucky
                    . Yet searches in Posey, 
                  Warrick, Knox
               , and surrounding counties have not shown that Lynn
                    recorded the freeing of any slaves after the territory was admitted as a state in 1816. He did free
                    one slave, Joe, on July 14, 1829, when he went before 
                        Posey County
                     Justice of the Peace Presley Pritchet and swore that he wished Joe to be enfranchised
                    and that he had always intended this. He recounted that he was making Joe's freedom a
                    matter of public record at this particular time because his father, James Lynn of 
                  Hopkins County, Kentucky
               , was now deceased, and his father's heirs intended to claim
                    Joe under the act relative to fugitives from labor and to take him into slavery. Lynn set forth the
                    circumstances under which the title to Joe had been left in his father's name. In 1805 or
                    1806 he had given his father money and property sufficient to purchase Joe and took a bill of sale
                    for him in his father's name. This was done because Dann Lynn was

                     contemplating going to Indiana Territory where there might be
                    emancipation laws which could deprive him of his property. With the papers in his father's
                    name he could have taken Joe to some slave state at any time to sell him. For all the ensuing years,
                    however, Joe had remained with him, and Lynn had conceived an affection for the black man and said
                    that he had always wished him to be enfranchised.57 The 1820 federal census for 
                        Posey County
                     shows one slave, age fourteen to twenty-five, living in the Lynn household.58 This was one of only eleven slaves in the county.59 By
                    the time the 1830 federal census was recorded, the black male listed with the Lynn family is shown
                    as free and between the ages of twenty-four and thirty-six.60 Lynn's
                    attitude toward his personal slave was consistent with his stand against slavery when he voted yea
                    to inserting the following words into the Indiana Constitution of 1816: 
                        But as the holding any part of the human family in slavery or involuntary servitude, can only
                            originate in usurpation and tyranny, it is the opinion of this convention, that no
                            alteration of this constitution ought ever to take place, so as to introduce slavery or
                            involuntary servitude in this state, otherwise than for the punishment of crimes, whereof
                            the party has been duly convicted.61

                                Indiana, I, 117. The constitution reads: "There shall be neither slavery
                            nor involuntary servitude in this state, otherwise than for the punishment of crimes,
                            whereof the party shall have been duly convicted. Nor shall any indenture of any negro or
                            mulatto hereafter made, and executed out of the bounds of this state be of any validity

                    ." Patrick Calvert, William Rogers, and Joe Cater, "bold and fearless
                    spirits," gathered a band of twenty-seven men, went to the town, and demanded to search the
                    entire area. The villagers, however, joined with Ford's gang, and a bloody battle ensued
                    until Dann Lynn stopped the fight, apparently keeping Calvert, who had been wounded, in his own home
                    until Calvert's health improved. Later, Cater organized another company of forty picked men
                    and not only searched West 
                        Franklin
                     (this time without opposition) but also crossed into 
                        Kentucky
                     and scoured the entire neighborhood without finding the boys. About 1824 Calvert
                    visited the Red River country in 
                        Arkansas
                     and found that the boys had been sold into slavery. He at once instituted legal
                    proceedings to recover their freedom and returned them to their mother. She then bound them to
                    Calvert, who "had been wounded in their behalf and who rescued them from a life of
                        servitude."62 A history of 
                        Vanderburgh County
                     published in 1889 gives a shorter but similar account of the incident, calling Jack
                    Lynn a "desperado."63
            
            Neither of the county histories gives the ending of this story. The 
                        Posey County
                     Circuit Court Order Book C shows that John P. Lynn was indeed charged with assault and
                    battery and intent to murder in 1822. Among other citizens charged in connection with the episode
                    were William and Willis Stallings, Louis B. and William Kincheloe, Francis W. Rowlett, John Henson,
                    and Isum Creek.64 William Kincheloe had married Jack Lynn's sister,
                        Margaretta.65 In the August, 1826, term of court it was considered by the
                    court that all counts should be "dismissed and the defendants go hence without
                        delay."66 John P. "Jack" Lynn was the son of Dann
                        Lynn.67
            
            Pitts ends his biography of the Honorable Dann Lynn by listing five of Lynn's grandchildren
                    who were still living in 1889. Thomas and Dann Martin were children of Rachel Lynn who married

                        Illinois
                    ; and, in 1883 Thomas Martin was in business in

                        Illinois
                    , were children of William Hopkins Kincheloe and Lynn's daughter Margaretta who
                    married in 
                        Posey County
                     in 1820. Another Lynn daughter, Mary Polly, married Peter Saltzman in 
                        Posey County
                     in 1820. The sons of Dann and Nancy Lynn were James D., who married Matilda Keister in
                    1834; John P. or "Jack," who married Dorcas Day in 1830; and Bedford B., who
                    married Ann Marrs in 1852. The fourth son and five other daughters mentioned by Pitts have not been
                    identified with certainty.69 Pitts' list of Lynn's
                    grandchildren should have included Bedford B. Lynn's two sons, Patrick N. and Alfred.70 Several great grandchildren were living in 
                        Posey County
                     in 1889, and some descendants are still there today.
            As far as the items can be verified, then, Pitts' biography of Lynn seems to be reasonably
                    reliable. It can be concluded that Lynn operated a flatboat as well as a ferry and that he was a
                    farmer, a trader, and an associate judge, as well as a state legislator. As an apparently honest
                    politician he took his public responsibilities seriously; and, even with a limited education, he
                    seems to have maintained good communications with his constituency. Lynn was not wealthy or famous,
                    but he was one of many Indiana pioneers who played a significant, if not a major, role in
                    Indiana's development.

            The history of the public domain in the 
                        United States
                     has been marked by a struggle for control between state and federal governments. The
                    ambiguities inherent in the division of sovereignty between the two levels of government created the
                    preconditions for conflict over ultimate administrative authority regarding public land. An
                    examination of one episode in this continuing squabble, Indiana's fulfillment of the
                    provisions of the congressional enactment of 1850 which granted to the states jurisdiction over
                    swamp lands within their boundaries, highlights some of the complexities implicit in this problem.
            The swamp lands of greatest interest in Indiana were those in the flat, marshy northwestern corner of
                    the state, parts of which were often flooded by the meandering Kankakee River.
                    Until the mid-1840s this region had been shunned by immigrants.1 To government
                    surveyor Jeremiah Smith the area encompassing 
                  Jasper,

                        Porter counties
                     was "rather uninviting to the capitalist and land speculator."2 The prominent Protestant minister, Henry Ward Beecher, thought the area
                    resembled the Pontine marshes.3

            In contrast to these pessimistic assessments, Solon Robinson, the noted agricultural editor, believed
                    that much of the swamp timber was valuable and that the area contained some tracts that could be
                        cultivated.4 Surveyor Smith confirmed the opinion that selective farming and
                    grazing could furnish an adequate income for squatters. Noting that cattle could forage on the lush
                    plant life, Smith pointed out that "south of the Yellow River, there
                    is as rich a pasturage as is to be found anywhere. The grass is thickly set and looks like an oat
                    field before it heads. In it a few Indian ponies are keeping fat in nature's choicest
                    luxuries."5 The removal of the excess water, however, was a prerequisite for profitable
                    farming in the region. Without a drainage system the area would remain "a most dreadful
                        swamp."6 Nevertheless, the Indiana Farmer and
                    Gardener editorially predicted in 1845 that prospects for any such ambitious project appeared
                    bleak: 
                        We do not suppose that the time has come in Indiana for the general introduction of a system
                            of Draining, although there is not, perhaps, another State where so much first rate land
                            might be redeemed by it. Before many years there will be thousands of acres pierced with
                            drains. But the inducements to it which make it wise in 
                                England
                             and New 
                                England
                             do not yet generally, exist in Indiana …. Many farmers have already
                            more arable land than they can till to advantage. Land redeemed from a slough would not pay
                            for itself in many years.7
                  
                    
            
            Following the splurge in land speculation during the 1830s, the opportunity of acquiring the
                    remaining portions of the public domain at reduced costs rekindled interest in swamp lands.
                    Recognizing this interest, the federal commissioner of the General Land Office, James Shields, in
                    his 1845 report proposed the transfer of unsaleable lands to the states. Shields predicted:
                    "It will be the policy of the States, in some instances, even to give bounties to settlers
                    to drain swamps and marshes and reclaim barren wastes, in order to render the lands salubrious and
                    capable of contributing to the support of local government."8
            
            In 1849 Congress enacted a statute which granted 
                        Louisiana
                     all the swamp and overflow land located within its

                     borders in order to aid the state's extensive
                    reclamation effort in flood control.9 A year later, in legislation generally
                    known as the Swamp Lands Act, the federal government extended the purview of the 
                        Louisiana
                     measure to include all states with public lands.10
            
            In the process of transferring the swamp lands to the states, federal land office registers were
                    expected to abstract evidence from surveyors' notes, taken during the initial government
                    surveys, pertaining to the condition of the land. The states, however, were allowed the option of
                    employing their own personnel if they objected to the registers' classification as to which
                    lands were swampy.11 In accordance with federal directions the state auditors
                    were to submit a list of townships encompassed by the act that might have been omitted from the
                    federal lists.12 Once the designations were forwarded to the General Land Office
                    in 
                        Washington
                    , comparisons revealed discrepancies. Acting upon information received from the land
                    office registers at Winamac and Vincennes, for example, Leander Chapman, surveyor-general of 
                        Michigan
                     and Indiana, rejected the state lists from 
                        Knox
                     and 
                        Benton
                     counties as erroneous.13 The classification of other acreage
                    throughout the state as swamp lands also remained in question for a number of years.
            By 1854 the federal government had approved the designation of 9,811,682 acres as
                    "wet" lands eligible for cession to Indiana but had rejected an additional 283,315
                    acres sought by the state.14 Acting on information supplied by the state
                    auditor, John P. Dunn, Governor Joseph A. Wright in 1853 had requested that Indiana be compensated
                    by the federal government for any swamp land that had already passed into private hands.15 In reply Commissioner John Wilson had expressed his concern for
                    "speedy and satisfactory" adjustment of these "perplexing
                    claims" but had admitted that new congressional

                     legislation would be necessary to accommodate the
                    state's demand.16
            
            Postponement of the final settlement of swamp lands selections soon resulted in additional
                    complications which involved the influx of settlers into the disputed areas. Entrymen often filed
                    claims on federal lands in the proposed swamp lands grant area oblivious to the threat of state
                    ownership. Unfortunately for them, the courts had already ruled that the congressional statute
                    ceding the lands to the states meant "a plain recognition of the prior right of the state
                    within her limits"; therefore, if challenged, the settlers who entered land might have
                    their titles declared invalid. Since the "swamp lands act operated as a present grant to
                    the subsequent determination of the true nature of the terrain," the state's legal
                    position was extraordinarily strong. As long as Indiana held "an inchoate title,"
                    only evidence of fraud could prevent transfer of ownership.17
            
            At first the Hoosier legislature sought to remove this source of discontent by declaring valid all
                    patents that had been filed prior to the passage of an act in 1852 regulating the sale of swamp
                    lands in the state. After 1852 settlers living on lands designated as swamp lands would presumably
                    be adjudged trespassers, and their only recourse would be to importune the General Land Office to
                    reject the state designation.18 If the government accepted the
                    settler's petition as worthy of consideration, a hearing would take place at one of the
                    local land offices after claimants had been given six months to gather evidence. In the presence of
                    the register and receiver, the two federally appointed local land officials, the petitioner had to
                    attest to the fact that at least half the forty acre tract was "under cultivation without
                    artificial drainage or embankment" and that it was "free from either regular or
                    periodic overflows at planting, growing, or harvesting season." To bolster his case the
                    claimant had to furnish

                            between September 28, 1850, the date of passage of the Swamp Lands Act, and the date when
                            such lands were approved as swamp lands, regardless of when this occurred. Indiana Laws (1855-1857), 207.

                    fit for cultivation."19
            
            The delays implicit in the implementation of this procedure created considerable uncertainty as to
                    the validity of titles. The rejection of state land selections lists and litigation concerning their
                    veracity discouraged large scale utilization of the disputed area. The 
                        Fort Wayne
                    
                    Sentinel expressed the sentiment of many Hoosiers when it editorially complained:
                    "We should like to be informed what reasons were there that these lands are so long
                    withheld from sale …. individuals are anxious to buy and settle on them; the settlement
                    and improvement of the state has been retarded by the unaccountable delay in bringing them to
                        market."20
            
            In an attempt to resolve this conflict, Congress in 1855 promised to reimburse the states for any
                    tracts that were taken up by private purchase and subsequently ratified for transfer to the states
                    under the provisions of the Swamp Lands Act. In cases in which the purchaser had paid with scrip
                    rather than cash to secure his entry, the state was authorized to select an alternate tract from the
                    unalienated portion of the public domain within its borders.21 Under the
                    provisions of this act Indiana ultimately received $39,080 and 4,880 acres to satisfy
                    outstanding claims.22
            
            Finally, in 1857, Congress moved to quiet the entire controversy by granting blanket approval to all
                    selections of swamp and overflow lands.23 Outraged, Thomas A. Hendricks, a
                    Hoosier who was appointed General Land Office commissioner in 1857, insisted that many claims were
                    not within "the whole spirit of the original grant." Concomitant with this
                    limitation upon the General Land Office's authority to determine which lands were swamp
                    lands, instructions were sent to local officials telling them to discontinue investigations into
                    "wet lands" designations.24 Since the state could now receive
                    reimbursement for any settled land which it claimed

                     as swamp land, most of Indiana's complaints were
                    satisfied.
            Although the final approval of all tracts did not occur until 1857, Indiana had moved at once in 1851
                    to comply with the provisions of the Swamp Lands Act in order to take advantage of any revenue that
                    might derive from sale of the lands granted by the federal government. Upon receipt of the news of
                    the congressional donation, the Indiana General Assembly had pledged any future monies received from
                    land sales for payment of the public debt.25 This disposition of funds reflected
                    the lingering effect of the state's disastrous experience with the deficit financing of
                    canals during the previous decade. However, allocation of the funds obtained from the sale of wet
                    lands were changed in the new state constitution which went into effect in September, 1851. Under
                    Article VIII, Section 2, dealing with financial support of the educational system, the delegates
                    pledged that "the proceeds of the sale of the swamp lands … after deducting the
                    expenses of selecting and drainage of the same," should be given to the Common School
                        Fund.26
            
            From 1851 to 1852 the legislature set about creating an administrative procedure to expedite the
                    handling of the swamp lands donation. Each county was to employ a surveyor charged with selecting
                    the tracts which qualified under the act. The surveyors were to forward their lists of designated
                    tracts to the state auditor for validation. After verification of the lands selected as swamp lands
                    by state and federal officials, sales would commence.27 The state auditor was
                    responsible for ensuring the preparation of maps and plats indicating the location of all swamp
                    lands within each county. After notice of the impending sale had been publicly posted, the county
                    auditor would hold a public auction at the courthouse.28
            
            The legislature passed stringent requirements as to the issuance of titles. The patent would be
                    nonassignable, and a duplicate of the sales receipt would be sent to the state capital to serve as
                    the basis for final papers. The governor and the secretary of state would sign each title. Sales
                    were made

                     with the understanding that Indiana would drain the land at
                    some future date.29
            
            To deal with the problem of reclamation the governor was to appoint a swamp lands commissioner for
                    each county. After consultation with a "practical engineer," the commissioner
                    could accept bids, then proceed with the execution of the drainage work at the lowest possible
                        cost.30 Through such a process it was hoped that a "desolate
                    waste" would be transformed into a "habitat for industrious, healthy and happy
                        people."31 Unfortunately, the procedure envisioned by the state
                    proved to be unrealistic, and the shortage of skilled individuals meant a reliance on either inept
                    or unscrupulous men. For example, Albert Davis, who functioned as an engineer, confessed at a
                    subsequent investigation that he had neither the experience nor the abilities to serve in such a
                    capacity but only carried chains, drove stakes, and "occasionally held the
                        rod."32
            
            In addition to formulating guidelines for implementing the Swamp Lands Act, the legislature also
                    established restrictions on allocations of the expected revenues. As indicated, after payment of
                    expenses incurred in selecting land, the furnishing of money to pay for costs of auctions, and
                    outlays to commissioners and laborers involved in reclamation, the remaining revenue was to become
                    part of the Common School Fund. In consideration of the wide disparity of wet lands existing in each
                    county, a separate account for each county was maintained in 
                        Indianapolis
                    .33 Expectations were that ultimately the northern portion of
                    Indiana would be worth five dollars an acre and support at least sixty thousand people.34
            
            By 1853 auctions were being held at courthouses in counties included in the ceded tracts. Although
                    the paper work became snarled, the initial revenues were sufficiently large to encourage Hoosier
                        officials.35 To spur investment the General Assembly demonstrated its
                    resolve to complete its

                     program of reclamation by authorizing payment of contractors
                    and engineers who had done ditching and draining work whether or not the county swamp land
                    commissioners who had hired them were legally qualified under the law.36
            
            The awarding of contracts attracted considerable comment. The 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Indiana Journal accused the commissioners of favoritism: 
                        Yesterday was the day fixed for the letting of contracts for draining lands in 
                                Jasper County
                            . I am informed that there were over one hundred bidders present and more than
                            180 bids tendered. This looks like there was fair competition and that the work would be let
                            on fair prices. Not so, however. The contract was let on private terms to Austin Puett, the
                            father-in-law of the Swamp Lands Commissioner [Albert] Davis. Puett is the brother-in-law of
                            [Governor] Joseph Wright, and of course, his pious excellency will never know that the
                            school fund is swindled by this transaction out of more than $10,000….
                            An attempt was made this morning to satisfy some of the principal bidders by offering the
                            subcontracts under Puett at "fair prices."37
                  
                     The 
                        Fort Wayne
                    
                    Sentinel voiced a similar complaint that the lowest offers were not chosen.38 The later misadventures of many contractors did indeed indicate their lack of
                    skill or even familiarity with reclamation techniques.
            By late 1854 nearly six hundred thousand dollars had been turned in to the state treasury from county
                        sales.30 Believing that receipts would amply repay the cost of projects, the
                    county swamp lands commissioners let out additional contracts. Unknown to the county officers,
                    however, the legislature had expended some of the funds which would be needed to pay contractors for
                    other agencies such as Indiana's benevolent institutions. Moreover, the payment of fees
                    further reduced the amount available to cover the rapidly expanding state liabilities.40
            
            By the spring of 1855 it became apparent that the optimistic appraisals of Indiana's ability
                    to finance the proposed drainage projects were incorrect. In view of this knowledge Governor Wright
                    and State Treasurer William R. Nofsinger notified the county authorities that no additional
                    contracts were to be granted untl funds were available in the state

                     treasury to pay for them.41 Prospective
                    purchasers of swamp lands apparently felt that this circular was a preliminary to repudiation on the
                    part of the state. The decline in revenue precipitated by the resultant drop in sales necessitated
                    even more drastic action by the governor. Realizing that receipts were insufficient for financing
                    the work, the governor suggested the expedient of trading work performed for land. Wright believed
                    it was essential for the state to demonstrate its good faith. As he informed the swamp lands
                    commissioners, "Many persons have invested money in Swamp Lands under the confident
                    expectation that the work of draining and improvement would be carried on vigorously and promptly,
                    justice to them, and the faith of the State, require that work should be prosecuted by all the means
                    within the reach of the State."42
            
            Although Governor Wright remained confident that continued revenue would cover the expenditures, the
                    new plan had already opened up a Pandora's box that would continue to plague the program.
                    The decision to "trade lands for ditching" was to become the basis for financing
                    the drainage projects. "Advance certificates" worth 75 percent of the
                    contractor's outlays were to be used either to purchase tracts or were to be sold to
                    procure funds to pay workers.43 This scrip often passed into the hands of
                    speculators who utilized it to purchase large tracts. In addition, by 1855 Indiana's
                    financial administration of the swamp lands program had become unglued. The central accounting of
                    receipts strained the limited resources of the bookkeeping staff at the capital; therefore, the
                    General Assembly had decided to allow the individual counties to keep the records.44 This measure, designed to alleviate the burden of paper work, opened the floodgates of
                    possible corruption even wider. By the fall of 1857 the entire program tottered on the verge of
                    collapse. The state auditor, John Dodd, accused the swamp lands commissioners of allowing the tracts
                    to fall into the hands of speculators who had no intention of fulfilling the terms of the agreement.
                    He suggested that each contract should contain a provision rendering it void if the work was not
                    satisfactorily completed within a reasonable time or by a specified date.45

            The press attacked many land purchasers. In 
                        Newton County
                    , Michael G. Bright, the brother of 
                        United States
                     Senator Jesse D. Bright, had acquired a huge amount of land. Implying illegal
                    collusion, one newspaper commented: "This gentleman now owns all the lands surrounding
                        Beaver Lake, which covers 17,000 acres. This land will be drained and Mr.
                    Bright will become owner of lands now submerged."46 Both Southey
                    Timmons, who had four thousand acres, and Solomon Slinger, who bought 1,720 acres in 
                        White County
                    , were labeled "speculators."47 A senate
                    investigating committee accused Ashbel P. Willard, who had become governor in 1856, of having
                    appointed a defaulting county treasurer to the position of a swamp lands commissioner.48
            
            In 1859 the Indiana Senate selected a special investigatory committee to examine all phases of the
                    program. The subsequent probe unearthed numerous examples of ineptness and criminality, both on the
                    part of county officials and of state officers. Its report castigated the swamp lands commissioners
                    in general as dishonest and inefficient and labeled their efforts as at least dilatory, at worst
                    fraudulent. The governor's appointments of commissioners and other officials were
                    "in many instances … singularly unfortunate" as the men possessed
                    "neither qualifications nor honesty of such a character as to fit them for their
                    responsibilities." The examination unearthed unlawful and wasteful practices honeycombing
                    the entire administrative structure. Since most of the laws relative to the swamp lands were
                    "radically defective," the committee recommended their immediate revision.49
            
            In 1861 the General Assembly created a new committee to continue the inquiry. On the basis of
                    "good and reliable information," the Republican Senate believed that
                    "only a portion of the work [of draining swamp lands] has been performed, and in a majority
                    of cases a spade has never broken the sod." The fund, they felt, had been
                    "plundered by the very men who had sworn to protect it."50 The
                    committee interrogated individuals involved in the drainage programs and

                     concluded that only about 10 percent of the contracted projects
                    were completed. In 
                        Jasper County
                    , the site of the worst scandal, Indiana might have lost as much as $118,000,
                    and quite probably more. In 
                        Starke County
                    , Charles Tibbits, the swamp lands commissioner, had, by 1861, assets of between fifty
                    and eighty thousand dollars, much of which was apparently acquired as a result of manipulation of
                    the swamp lands fund51 In its report to the General Assembly the committee
                    concluded: 
                        The different laws in relation to the expenditures of the swamp lands are …
                            imperfect, giving opportunities for dishonest men to prey with impunity …. It
                            seems that … the opportunity to speculate was early discovered by several
                            prominent men and large combinations formed to secure that objective … and where
                            a swamp lands commissioner refused to be an instrument in their hands to carry out their
                            means, they were potent in affecting his removal and in securing the appointment of one who
                            would act in accordance with their wishes. The deplorable lack of control … has
                            permitted situations in which the estimates were constantly raised in order to maximize
                                profits.52
                  
                    
            
            Many of the contracts outstanding reflected poorly on the caliber of the appointees of the Democratic
                    administration. A county clerk in 
                        White County
                     wrote to Governor Willard about one contractor: "I was informed by reliable
                    men that the Democratic candidate for clerk last year lost a large vote in Riley's [the
                    contractor's] neighborhood for the simple reason that Riley was his friend and was seen
                    riding with him …. Pay him out of the swamp lands fund to leave the county or we will
                    lose the whole floating vote … and many regular Democrats."53 A 
                        Daviess County
                     official also expressed his anger over the progress on the drainage projects in his
                    locality. In a letter to the governor he wrote: "Good engineers have told me that much of
                    the money expended might as well have been thrown away … the ditches were the same depth
                    from the surface uphill, downhill and level ground …. When he laid out a ditch two miles
                    long to the 
                        Prairie
                     creek … his level was four inches higher than when he started."54

            The difficulties with the execution of the grant did not end with the uncovering of the mismanagement
                    of reserves. In 1864 state auditor Arthur Ristine reported that as a result of poor bookkeeping many
                    titles were subject to court contests. His investigations revealed that the records
                    "exhibited much carelessness, omissions, and irregularities."55 The litigation continued. In 1875 State Auditor Edward 
                        Henderson
                     also pointed out that patents were constantly "being called into question and
                    jeopardizing the interests of innocent persons who are in possession of valuable improved farms
                    which they bought and paid for in good faith, believing that their titles [were] legal and
                        correct."56 As late as 1916 hundreds of patents were still in
                        dispute."57
            
            In toto, the state selected 1,354,732 acres of swamp lands of which 1,264,833 were granted and
                    1,257,588 sold. Indiana received an average price of $1.29 (including devaluated scrip)
                    per acre, totaling $1,759,752; however, the $1,674,932 spent on drainage
                    programs and administrative expenses left only $496,834 for the Common School Fund.
                    Sixteen counties had overspent their credit derived from the revenues.58
            
            Many of the choicest locations in northern Indiana were acquired with the assistance of swamp lands
                    scrip. George Clark, a civil engineer from 
                        Chicago
                     who specialized in locating sites for possible railroad rights of way, purchased 11,531
                    acres of swamp lands from the state. This land, in addition to other acres purchased at private and
                    tax sales, today covers the sites of Whiting, East 
                        Chicago
                    , and portions of 
                        Hammond
                     and 
                        Gary
                    . Hoosier speculators such as James Barnett of 
                        Fort Wayne
                     and Calvin Fletcher of 
                        Indianapolis
                     entered scattered tracts near their other holdings. Ernst W. Hohman bought more than
                    four hundred acres, upon which the city of 
                        Hammond
                     was later platted.59
            
            Although most of the swamp land passed into private hands by 1860, permanent residents were found in
                    those areas

                     that suffered floods only during the spring. In many counties
                    wet lands were not farmed until after the Civil War. Not until the establishment of private drainage
                    enterprises such as the 
                        Lake County
                     Association in 1865 and the Calumet Valley Drainage Company in
                    1868 were effective steps at reclamation undertaken.60
            
            Indiana's difficulties in administrating an efficient drainage program had retarded the
                    agricultural utilization of its wet lands. Like so many of the congressional enactments dealing with
                    the disposal of the public domain, little consideration was given to the realities of frontier life.
                    Grandiose plans for rapid transformation of the barren wilderness were foiled by the lack of
                    expertise needed to complete such a project. Such failures were to become the hallmarks of state
                    administration in the nineteenth century.

            During the Civil War years the Indiana Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends directed much of its
                    philanthropic work toward the education and rehabilitation of the freed Negroes in the South. Such
                    activity on the part of Indiana Quakers followed an historic tradition dating back to the first
                    meeting of the Indiana Yearly Meeting of Friends in 1821. From that time on through the Civil War
                    the meeting maintained a Committee on the Concerns of the People of Color, the primary function of
                    which dealt with the promotion of education for Negroes. Through the committee's efforts,
                    between thirty and forty day schools were in operation in Indiana just prior to the Civil War for
                    the instruction of blacks. Quakers also aided fugitive slaves by furnishing legal counsel or
                    assisting them in their movement northward. During the war years the Indiana Yearly Meeting
                    cooperated with the 
                  Ohio, Iowa
               , and Western meetings in aiding the freedman.1
            
            Following President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, Indiana Quakers
                    began to send agents and volunteers south to aid the freedmen. The minutes of the yearly meeting in
                    1864 noted: "About the beginning of the present year, we learned that large numbers of
                    freedmen, mostly women and children, had arrived within the Union

                             concern for the condition of the Negro can be traced to colonial times when
                            William Penn in 1700 established a monthly meeting for Negroes. Soon these groups formed the
                            nucleus of the antislavery movement in the colonies. John Hope Franklin, From

                        Tennessee
                    , in a very destitute condition…. This was liberally responded to, and a
                    large amount of clothing was procured and forwarded."2 By 1864 the
                    Indiana Yearly Meeting had sent approximately twenty-one volunteers to set up schools and asylums,
                    teach, and distribute goods to Negroes in those southern states occupied by federal armies. During
                    1864 the Indiana Friends spent $23,153.37 to provide medicine, books, farm implements,
                    and dry goods for the freedmen.3 In 1865 a number of activities which had been
                    initiated by the Quakers were taken over by the Freedman's Bureau, a federal agency.
                    Nevertheless, the Indiana Yearly Meeting still provided $14,631.14 for the relief of the
                    Negro in 1865.4
            
            Federal policy toward the contrabands—i.e., blacks escaping to or
                    brought within Union lines during the war5— was confused at best.
                    Some Union officers were of pro-slavery sentiment while others were rabid abolitionists. For
                    example, General Henry W. Halleck prohibited slaves from entering his lines; General David Hunter,
                    even before 
                        Lincoln
                    's Emancipation Proclamation, issued orders stating that persons held as slaves
                    were forever free; and General John C. Frémont likewise ordered confiscation of property
                    and freeing of slaves. 
                        Lincoln
                     later remanded Hunter's and 
                        Fremont
                    's orders, stating that such a move was premature. With the passage of the
                    first Confiscation Act on August 6, 1861, the federal government had attempted to establish uniform
                    treatment for fugitives who had fled to Union lines. The act provided that any property used by the
                    owner's consent and with his knowledge in aiding or abetting insurrection against the 
                        United States
                     was a lawful subject of prize and capture. Property consisting of slaves

                     5 The term "contraband" as applied to property was
                            the designation Riven to slaves escaping to or brought within Union lines during the Civil
                            War. The origin of the term came from Union General Benjamin F. Butler who applied it to the
                            runaways escaping to his lines in early 1861. 
                                Butler
                             neither freed nor returned the Negroes but had them work instead on his
                            fortifications. Mark Mayo Boatner III, The Civil War Dictionary (
                                New York
                            , 1959), 172. The term "refugees" came to include both white
                            and black persons fleeing their homes and plantations in search of freedom and
                        sustenance.
               
                     was to be forever free." Throughout the war, however,
                    military policy toward the contrabands remained inconsistent and their condition poor.
            Following their annual meeting in 1863 the Indiana Quakers sent Walter Totten Carpenter to 
                        Tennessee
                     and 
                        Alabama
                     to aid the contrabands. Born in Duanesburg, 
                        New York
                    , on January 1, 1811, Carpenter, a birthright member of the Society of Friends,
                    immigrated to 
                  Clinton County, Ohio
               , with his family in 1815. In 1834, after marrying Susan
                    Mabie, he moved to 
                        Cincinnati
                     and began to operate a general store and milk business. Seven years later Carpenter and
                    his family returned to Clarksville, 
                        Ohio
                    , where he entered into partnership in a mercantile firm with John Hadley. Returning to 
                        Cincinnati
                     in 1844, Carpenter joined his brother, Calvin, in the general commission business.
                    Carpenter's second stay in 
                        Cincinnati
                     lasted four years. Alarmed by the possibility of contracting tuberculosis, he and his
                    family returned to Clarksville. Finally, in 1857, the Carpenters left Clarksville and moved to
                            
                  Richmond, Indiana
               . During the next two decades Walter and Susan Carpenter served as
                    superintendent and matron at Earlham College in 
                        Richmond
                    . As matron, Mrs. Carpenter had charge of the domestic arrangements of the college while
                    Mr. Carpenter had general responsibility for the entire functioning of the institution, both
                    academic and operational. During most of the period from 1858 to 1872 they remained at Earlham. The
                    longest break in this role came during 1866–1868 when the Carpenters resigned due to Mrs.
                    Carpenter's poor health. The single other interruption came during 1863–1864
                    when Mr. Carpenter traveled to the southern states as agent of the Freedman's Committee of
                    the Indiana Yearly Meeting of Friends. Around 1880 Carpenter was appointed to a trusteeship at
                    Earlham College, a position which he held until 1893. He died on August 31, 1910, at the age of
                        ninety-nine.7
            
            Carpenter kept an account of his trip to hospitals and contraband camps in middle 
                        Tennessee
                     and northern 
                        Alabama
                     in 1863–1864. It is evident from his diary that he was a literate and
                    observant individual. His spelling is accurate, although punctuation is sometimes original. The

                        My fifty-third birthday, never remember to have passed this anniversary under so much
                                    mental disruption.
                        Have been casting in my mind whether it is caused by not having performed my various
                                    duties during the past year as I should have done; or whether it is somewhat in
                                    sympathy with the very many who in the present condition of our country are
                                    universally exposed to this very severely cold atmosphere; or whether it is from the
                                    prospect of leaving my family and home in a few days for a temporary sojourn in the
                                    south or what is to me an untried field of labour.
                        1 month 4 [January 4]
                        Left home hardly knowing whither I am going and still less when I may return.

                                            addition of periods and a few commas to facilitate reading,
                                            Carpenter's punctuation and paragraphing have been followed as

                                            abbreviations have been spelled out; and obvious repetitions have been
                                            omitted. Because of the difficulty in distinguishing between capital and
                                            lower case letters, modern usage has been followed so far as capitalization

                        Wilst my family and friends at home were as I hope, attending to the duty and
                                    enjoying the privilege of worship I did not see how I could be better employed than
                                    in visiting some of the freedmen at their various stopping places. Found some in
                                    tents some in basements some in garrets and some in open out buildings. Many of them
                                    thinly clad and with all the clothing they possess on their backs. Yet none of them
                                    complained of extreme suffering. All that are able to work can get employment and I
                                    did not meet with a family but what had one or more of that class.

                                    got there about 9, a distance of thirty miles.
                        First looked through one of the hospitals for sick and wounded soldiers containing
                                    about two hundred but few of whom are confined to their beds. Next went to the
                                    contraband hospital under care of Lt. Charles N. Hood containing about eighty some
                                    of them very ill.
                        Then to the contraband camp near by where near two thousand occupy shanties left by
                                    soldiers. They are many of them from this section of the country are well clad and
                                    mostly well supplied with bedding. They all have rations dealt out to them and the
                                    men have employment but the women say they can get nothing to do. About one fourth
                                    are men about one third women and the balance children. Also went out to the great
                                    battle ground on a six thousand acre cotton farm which is now mostly out to the
                                        commons.2 Since the battle, extensive fortifications have
                                    been erected which are now nearly completed, with ample bomb proof magazines. 
                              
                                 2 Carpenter probably refers to the Battle of

                                    and then we were trundled into frait [sic] and cattle cars ten
                                    miles to Bridgeport. Every thing now becomes strictly military rarely seeing one in
                                    citizen's clothing. The tide of travel down to the front as they call it
                                    wonderful and yet nearly all directly connected with the army. Drifting down with it
                                    there is such a constant flow of profanity one can hardly keep the language out of
                                    mind "broad is the way and wide is the gate" &c and
                                    occasionally the antichristian spirit becomes so dominant that he begins to cast
                                    about with some anxiety lest the ten. righteous could not be found in the midst.5 At Stevenson are about 150 contrabands mostly women and
                                    children and at Bridgeport about 130 mostly men. At both places they are furnished
                                    tents and rations by government.6 The business at Bridgeport is
                                    immense, all the army stores having to be re-shipped besides supplying a number of
                                    regiments here in winter quarters. Some ten thousand persons are here living in
                                    tents. These are surroundings so different from what we at the north are accustomed
                                    that we can scarcely realize that we are in our own country. The railroad to

                                    would be delightful trip, but the boat was small and not more than half of the

                                    have them set to work on confiscated farms where they can earn a living, and

                                    be a pleasant one, but on board a boat that afforded neither fire or breakfast for
                                    passengers it was rather tedious, not getting to Bridgeport until one
                                    o'clock.

                                    a failure, and we continued with the frait train to

                                    troops and seems to be interested for contrabands. He furnished me a horse to ride
                                    out in the country with J. B. White and see about a hundred of the wives and
                                    children of those who have enlisted, now under care of government, which they are
                                    finding homes for as they have opportunity. They have good house room and sufficient

                                    the number had died last night, and that a case of small pox had just broken out,
                                    which will probably spread through the company. Called on David M. Wilson, agent for
                                    the Western Freedman's Aid Society,12 who is furnished
                                    a room by government and appears to be working in earnest for the relief of the
                                    destitute contrabands. Those who appear to be best informed on the subject estimate

                                                United States
                                             Infantry, was sent to 
                                                Nashville
                                             during 1863 to aid in the organization of Negro regiments.
                                            Historians often credit him with being one of the first regular army
                                            officers to ask permission to raise Negro troops. He is reputed to have been
                                            the first to suggest enlistment of Negro regiments as 
                                                United States

                                 12 The Western Freedman's Aid Commission was
                                            organized in January. 1863, at 
                                    Cincinnati, Ohio
                                 , with Levi Coffin as its general agent. Coffin
                                            had arrived in 
                                    Newport,
                                                    Indiana
                                 , in 1826, where he
                                            became an active participant in the Indiana Yearly Meeting of Friends. In
                                            the mid-1840s he moved to 
                                    Cincinnati, Ohio
                                 , where he continued his activity on behalf of the
                                            Negro. The Society of Friends in 
                                                Ohio
                                             and Indiana were among the earliest and most ardent supporters
                                            of the Western Freedman's Aid Commission. The commission proposed
                                            to supply the physical wants of the freedman plus aiding in their
                                            instruction, guidance, and elevation. See Report of the Western

                                     here at this time, at ten thousand, over two
                                    thirds of whom are contrabands with daily accessions. Visited a large school
                                    building now filled with refugees. Many of the rooms very much crowded and dirty in
                                    the extreme. They appear to be quite as destitute and in every respect as degraded
                                    as the contrabands. 13 Some of them have been driven from their
                                    homes but most of them have left to avoid starvation there being nothing left in
                                    their neighborhoods to subsist upon.
                        1 month 20
                        Visited the two coloured schools which have been put in operation by the
                                    Presbyterians. In one of them was about fifty and in the other about one hundred and
                                    thirty pupils shaded all the way from black to white, but all I suppose having a
                                    tincture of African blood.
                        They were well clad mostly clean, looked intelligent and were making respectable
                                    recitations. Went next to some of the poorest houses filled with contrabands. A
                                    single room with no glass windows but holes enough between the logs on weather
                                    boarding to light it, rents for five dollars a month. In such a room we often find
                                    four or five families quartered. When they come to lay down at night they cover the
                                    entire floor.
                        5 day [Thursday], 1 month 21
                        Started in the afternoon to Clarksville on board the Carrie a very nice little boat.
                                    Met on board with Ira H. Hutchins and William Brown of Indiana and Hannah Hughes of 
                                        Ohio
                                     on their way to Clarksville to open a school for contrabands under the
                                    Western Freedman's Aid Commission.
                        Sixth day, 1 month 22
                        A delightful spring morning, and in a walk around Clarksville I find it one of the
                                    pleasants [sic] villages I have seen in the south. It had a
                                    population of some five thousand before the rebellion but is reduced below that at
                                    present. It gives but little evidence of the devastations of war.14 There 
                              
                                 13 White refugees were also aided by the Western

                                 , boasted a population
                                            estimated near 3,000 at the time of the Civil War. Situated on the
                                                Cumberland River, Clarksville provided a convenient
                                            shipping point for supplies for the surrounding area. See Julie Hodgson, A Comparison of Three

                                     has been about eight hundred coloured troops
                                    enlisted here and the women and children to the number of about twenty-five hundred
                                    are still here.
                        Seventh day, 1 month 23, 1864
                        Another beautiful spring day. The coloured people here, both residents and
                                    contrabands, are to all appearances as well dressed and clothed as they are at the
                                    north and if any thing is done for them here it should be in the way of
                                        instruction.15 At two o'clock attended a meeting of
                                    coloured inhabitants called by those who have come to establish schools amongst
                                    them. About two hundred in attendance young and old and they evinced a lively
                                    interest in the cause and the old men prefered to furnish fire wood and assist in
                                    repairing the college building which has been sadly abused nearly all the glass
                                    being broken out. About nine o'clock the Ladonia came up and I went aboard
                                    for 
                                        Nashville
                                     expecting to arrive there by morning but she proved to be a slow
                                    running boat, and meeting with unexpected hindrances did not get there until the
                                    following morning.
                        Second day, the 25th of 1 month
                        A beautiful spring day. Finding no goods here yet and no instructions from the
                                    committee and apprehending there is nothing more that I can do to advantage in this
                                    department I have made arrangements with David M. Wilson to receive and distribute
                                    my goods and am preparing to leave for home tomorrow morning.
                        Third day, 26
                        Went to the train but found the cars entirely filled with soldiers.
                        Fourth day, 27
                        The passenger train again filled with soldiers but succeeded in getting into a frait
                                    car which was not crowded and had a pleasant trip to 
                                        Louisville
                                    .

                                        Carpenter's remarks on the freedman's response to education.
                                        One teacher recalled: "I have never met with children so very eager to
                                        have it come to their turn to read, or equal to them in enduring cold and
                                        uncomfortable positions to have the privilege of saying their lessons."

                                    Visited a number of houses in town and found a good deal of sickness and
                                    destitution. Also went out to a new camp just formed to which 140 came today with a

                                     the car next to the locomotive took fire and the train could not
                                    connect with the locomotive until it was consumed. Whilst waiting a couple of men
                                    rode up and entering into conversation with them I soon learned that they were
                                    connected with a contraband camp about a mile distant and I at once accepted their
                                    kind invitation to go and spend the night with them. I found near three hundred of
                                    them quartered in new cabins covered with clapboards held on by light poles, doors
                                    and floors of split timber and stick chimneys. I spent the night comfortably in one
                                    of these cabins and think them the most thrifty colony of contrabands. There are
                                    four other farms under the same superintendent Lt. Joseph W. Harris containing in
                                    all upwards of a thousand acres and the whole number of contrabands on the list is
                                    920. They have been worked through the winter in picking cotton part of the time on
                                    shares and part of the time some field which had been confiscated and they allowed
                                    to pick it and put the proceeds in the contraband fund which now amounts to about
                                    9,000 dollars. All the officers here connected with the subject are sound and work
                                    hearty and with a creditable interest. I wish I could say as much for them at

                        Looking back over my association with the Freedman there are two prominent traits of
                                    character that are particularly observable.
                        One is the general absense of a feeling of revenge or spirit of retaliation towards
                                    those who have oppressed, and in some cases brutually maltreated them, and the other
                                    is the so frequent want of chastity amongst the females.
                        This is easily accounted for in the workings of the system of slavery, which renders
                                    the marriage contract a mockery, liable to be broken at any moment by the claiment
                                    of either party, and the females whether married or unmarried in many cases subject
                                    to beastly masters and overseers, whose will is law without appeal, one may say they
                                    are educated to prostitution, and I fear the present system of camp life in which
                                    two or three families of children, and frequently young men and women are huddled
                                    together in one tent, will not tend by any means to correct this great evil.

            Walter Havighurst was a splendid choice to write the 
                        Ohio
                     volume in the American Association for State and Local History's American
                    Revolution Bicentennial series. The association's charge to the authors—to write
                    an "interpretive, sensitive, thoughtful, individual, even personal"
                    account— has been fulfilled. Those familiar with Havighurst's many books
                    relating segments of 
                        Ohio
                    's history can anticipate the lyric, poetic quality of this work. A romantic
                    haze hangs over Havighurst's 
                        Ohio
                    , softening the harsher edges of its experience yet not seriously distorting reality.
            If there is a central theme to this work, it is the boundless optimism and unremitting toil of early
                    settlers and developers who found a rich and favored land that contained everything needed for both
                    an agricultural and an industrial frontier. Success was assured, progress inevitable; the
                    "flag shaped state" was the certain end point of a productive social development.
            Havighurst is at his best writing about topics that have long interested him—the romance
                    of the river trade, Great Lakes shipping, the survey and sale of western lands, the clearing of
                    initial settlements in the great forest. Politics pass almost unnoticed except for a graceful and
                    perceptive summary of the presidents born and raised in 
                        Ohio
                    . Each major city is sketched briefly; indeed, too briefly to capture the particular
                    flavor of each. Other topics which receive but brief mention, or no mention at all, are religion,
                    colleges, interurbans, recreation, the fine arts, and organized sports. Some important
                    periods—the American Revolution, for example—are not covered; only twelve
                    pages are given to the half century following Warren G. Harding's death.
            Although the author was not obligated to cover the total experience of the state and its people, the
                    chronological imbalance leaves the impression that 
                        Ohio
                    's great days were largely over by 1920, as perhaps they were insofar as the
                    fixing of its character is concerned. Some other authors in this series of state histories have
                    truncated their accounts in  like fashion. Perhaps this tendency
                    is inherent in studies that search for the central nature or essence of a state that reached
                    maturity more than a half century ago.
            As so often is the case with generalized overviews, there are a number of factual errors in this
                    book. They are not of major proportion and do not detract notably from the overall effect of the
                    work. A picture essay of sixteen photographs by Joe Clark, while conveying some sense of
                    "typical" 
                        Ohio
                     views, is too limited to contribute much to one's feeling for the
                    state's people and places. These caveats aside, however, the general reading public, for
                    whom this book is designed, will profit from the instruction and the pleasure they will experience
                    as they renew their acquaintance with 
                        Ohio
                     through the pen of a skilled and sympathetic interpreter.

                            Ohio
                         and the Color Line is the product of a superb research effort by David A.
                    Gerber. And yet, somewhat paradoxically, this thorough and extensive research is both the
                    book's strength and its weakness. On the one hand Gerber brings together a body of black
                    newspapers, black manuscript collections, black memoirs, statistics, and unpublished scholarly
                    studies in such a way as to tell more about the "bricks and mortar" of the lives
                    of blacks in late nineteenth century 
                        Ohio
                     than is known for any other northern state. On the other hand, however, the tremendous
                    amount of detail at the author's disposal poses problems of style and focus which are not
                    entirely overcome. Repetitive examples, complex sentence structure, and very extensive footnoting
                    frequently pack the chapters with more detail than is necessary and consequently diminish the impact
                    of analysis. The book's literary shortcomings do not reduce its high scholarly value, but
                    they probably will restrict its use by others than historians.
            The period 1860 to 1915 was a time of peaks and valleys for black Ohioans, as it was for black
                    Americans everywhere. Gerber documents a shifting black outlook which moved from  pessimism about the future (pre-1865), to hope (1865–1890),
                    and, finally, to uncertainty and resignation (1890–1915). Race relations in 
                        Ohio
                     reflected intrastate differences and a sensitivity to national trends. In fact, one is
                    struck by the great similarities between the black experience in 
                        Ohio
                     and that found in the border state South. The element of fear does not rank as high in 
                        Ohio
                     (though keenly present at the turn of the century), but the experience in politics, job
                    opportunities, access to public accommodations, and internal class structure are very similar.
            Gerber satisfactorily describes "the evolution of black citizenship" which he
                    identifies as a primary goal (p. x), but he probably contributes even more in what he sees as the
                    secondary area of "internal development of black communities" (p. x). The
                    discussions of class consciousness, the growth and activity of institutions, and the problems of
                    crime and poverty get down to the issues which make life tangible and real. Gerber is especially
                    effective in dealing with problems of racial unity. He shows how class consciousness inhibited this
                    unity, how black institutions only partly bridged the divisions, and how differences in philosophy
                    among black leaders were enhanced by the deterioration of race relations in general.
            The intended focus of this book is black 
                        Ohio
                    , and the author is faithful to this focus. At a few points, however, the discussion
                    would benefit from a somewhat less parochial view. In dealing with the increased pace of
                    institutional development, social programs, and business organizations among blacks at the turn of
                    the century, Gerber correctly identifies motives of controlling the lower class, expressions of
                    charity, and a response to "an age of intolerance and rejection" (p. 433). But
                    these are not only meaningful observations within the context of 
                        Ohio
                    , they are manifestations in the black communities (identifiable in other states as
                    well) of the broad national phenomenon of progressivism. To stop short of making this connection is
                    to stop short of the full meaning of the black experience in 
                        Ohio
                    .
            Despite some shortcomings in style and limitations in analysis, Black 
                            Ohio
                         and the Color Line is a valuable and important book for persons interested in
                    race relations and black history.

                    detailed to be covered adequately in a brief review. Footnotes and an essay on sources give evidence
                    of the extensive research in primary and secondary materials. Numerous excellent maps and pictures,

                        Wisconsin
                     was admitted to the Union thirty-two years after Indiana. Both states, however, were
                    carved out of the Old Northwest, and there are parallels and similarities in developments in the two
                    states in the era of the Civil War. For example, development of transportation was vital to both.
                    Both experienced a plank road craze and a more lasting obsession with chartering and building
                    railroads. In both states a network of short lines was consolidated into a few main systems by the
                    1870s. Though railroads brought economic benefits, they were viewed with suspicion and hostility by
                    farmers in the two areas, but railroad lobbies were sufficiently powerful to block regulatory
                    legislation. In both states the Democratic party was dominant at the beginning of the 1850s. By 1860
                    party realignments had occurred which led to the ascendancy of the new Republican party.
            There were also, however, significant differences between 
                        Wisconsin
                     and Indiana. Most striking perhaps were differences in the composition of the
                    population. In 
                        Wisconsin
                     one third of the population in 1860 had been born in foreign countries, and one half
                    consisted of foreigners and their children. Germans were most numerous, constituting a larger
                    percentage of the population than in any other state, but many other nationalities were represented.
                    Of 
                        Wisconsin
                     residents born in the 
                        United States
                    , the largest number came from states of the Northeast.
            Ethnicity was reflected in the diversity of religious groups and in social patterns and was an
                    important force in  shaping politics. Catholics constituted the
                    largest denomination. Ethnic attitudes were reflected on such issues as temperance, abolition,
                    emancipation, and conscription. During the Civil War many of the foreign born were segregated in
                    companies and even regiments of a single nationality. Current believes that the war increased ethnic
                    tensions and a sense of ethnic identity. Indiana, in contrast, was less affected by European
                    immigration in this period than any northern state.

                    :

            During the past decade an impressive historical literature has appeared that focuses on the social,
                    economic, and political characteristics of immigrant groups in America and on their relationships to
                    the rest of society. Kathleen Neils Conzen's Immigrant Milwaukee is one
                    of the best of these studies. Treating the first quarter century of Milwaukee's history,
                    Conzen concentrates on the Germans, who by 1860 accounted for slightly more than half of the
                    households in the city. Irish and British immigrants were much less numerous and are often analyzed
                    in this account only as contrasted to the Germans.
            Conzen presents extensive data to define the place of immigrants in the frontier city. Residential
                    patterns, mobility rates, occupational distributions, family size, the status of women, literacy,
                    and school attendance are among the variables examined, and all are related to ethnicity. She shows
                    that while native born persons ranked disproportionately high on the economic ladder, the Irish were
                    low, the British clustered at the middle, and the Germans were to be found at all levels. Thus, only
                    the numerous Germans had the range and heterogeneity necessary for the development of a genuinely
                    ethnic community with a full complement of supportive functions independent of the host society. By
                    contrast, the more homogeneous Irish, smaller in number, were limited by their lack of wealth,
                    education, and skills in  the variety of activities they could
                    engage in as ethnics. Their community was therefore essentially a class division clothed in
                    ethnoreligious distinctions.
            Within the German sub society, however, social and religious divisions deepened over time. As middle
                    class and educated Germans prospered, they supported cultural development and gave substance to
                    Milwaukee's reputation as the German 
                        Athens
                    . The well known German refugees of the revolutions of 1848, in Conzen's view,
                    only augmented a process of social differentiation already underway. Meanwhile, large numbers of
                    unskilled German immigrants continued to pour into the city, especially during the 1850s.
            All ethnic groups in the city, but especially the Irish, were highly concentrated in rather well
                    defined residential districts, and there was an intensification of ethnic clustering as the years
                    passed. Milwaukee's immigrants did not conform to the frequently described movement from
                    the city core to suburban areas. Instead, newcomers found homes on the edge of the city as older
                    districts improved in status and security, hence in attractiveness to upwardly mobile immigrants.
            Conzen attacks the familiar ghetto model of immigrant experience with her analysis of the German
                    associational activity. Rejecting the convention that immigrant voluntary organizations were
                    accommodations to exclusion from established society, she argues that Milwaukee's many vereine were essentially familiar forms of association developed in 
                        Germany
                     by middle class urbanites who transferred them to 
                        American cities
                    . The German community enjoyed such cultural and institutional variety that few
                    immigrants felt the need to leave it completely. Because of its remarkable heterogeneity, it
                    functioned all the more effectively in easing the process of adjustment to American life.
            In a long chapter on politics Conzen shows that the classic model of the urban political machine
                    erected on ethnic votes has little applicability to antebellum Milwaukee. The Germans as a group
                    never had the lower class homogeneity assumed by the model; hence, unlike the Irish, they did not
                    produce a machine vote. Even though the Germans tended to prefer the Democratic party, of which they
                    formed the major segment, they were prepared to vote independently. The author effectively treats
                    anticlericalism as a political issue and describes the advent of Republicanism as the agent that
                    crystallized  divisions of class, religion, and time of arrival
                    within the German community. Like most recent students of midnine-teenth century ethnic politics,
                    she finds that voting rights for immigrants and other political dimensions of nativism were major
                    issues, whereas slavery and European nationalism were not.
            By any measure this book is a major contribution to American social history. It is characterized by
                    thorough research, brilliant interpretation, and lucid writing. Conzen has set a new standard of
                    excellence for urban and ethnic historians.

                     and Company, 1976. Pp. ix, 211. Note on sources, index. $7.50.)
            There has long been a need for a one volume interpretative biography of "Fighting
                    Bob" La Follette. David P. Thelen did not seek to fill this void, and it continues to
                    exist. Like other books in the Library of American Biography series, this study
                    focuses as much on the times as on the individual. The result, in this instance, is a provocative
                    analysis of the "insurgent spirit" during the first quarter of the twentieth
                    century with La Follette viewed as the chief representative of the "radical"
                    reformers.
            La Follette's service as a three term congressman from 
                        Wisconsin
                     during the Gilded Age did not suggest the ardent progressive who emerged after 1897. As
                    a governor and senator, "Fighting Bob" denounced corporate wealth and privilege
                    and the inequities of the capitalistic system. When he opposed America's entry into World
                    War I, he felt the wrath of those committed to "making the world safe for
                    democracy." During the Harding-Coolidge years he kept the flame of reform burning in the
                    midst of the darkness of corruption and economic repression. His courage won La Follette the respect
                    of his enemies, and the Senate would later name him one of its five greatest members.
            A determined and consummate politician, La Follette was not converted to progressivism as the result
                    of a bribery attempt by a Stalwart, as he later alleged. Rather, he recognized  that the taxpayers and voters of 
                        Wisconsin
                     demanded state and local governments that would equalize taxes and improve public and
                    private services. When La Follette saw a change in emphasis by progressives toward concern for jobs
                    and economic expansion, he accommodated this shift, but he continued to reflect the more
                    "radical" aspects of progressivism. His efforts on behalf of the Seamen's
                    Act combined concern for the welfare of American sailors with a desire to enhance the safety of
                    passengers. Above all, La Follette kept abreast of the changing mood of the electorate in the Badger
                    State and the Midwest.
            Thelen's interpretation alternately challenges and frustrates. He writes of a
                    "progressive movement" often divided between the "insurgents"
                    and the "modernizers." His arguments are very similar to those made in his equally
                    provocative book, The New Citizenship (1972). As Thelen places La Follette in the
                    vanguard of those who wished to make government responsive to the problems of a nation being
                    transformed by industrial capitalism, he attempts to make a distinction between the
                    consumer/taxpayer "insurgents" and the job oriented
                    "modernizers." In so doing, he tells the reader almost as much about the 1960s and
                    1970s as he does about the progressive era.
            Undergraduates will find the book provoking and stimulating, and graduate students will be forced to
                    come to grips with the theses. The general reader may long for more about La Follette and less of
                    Thelen's analysis of "insurgency."

            Alumni will find this sympathetic study of their school nostalgically rewarding. For others, it will
                    constitute a case study of the virtual revolution in higher education of the recent past. Beginning
                    as a non collegiate normal school, the institution at Eau Claire progressed through the familiar  stages from teachers college to part of a pluralistic state
                    university system. Such schools have often been criticized by educational purists but praised by
                    others as "peoples' colleges" supplying local and inexpensive training to
                    a near cross section of the nation's youth. Whether a different type of institution could
                    have better performed this service is irrelevant to the historical process. The American social
                    revolution was still alive in the field of educational opportunities.
            The authors have produced a carefully researched, well written history with an attractive format.
                    Much labor, love, and care have obviously gone into its production. The work's semiofficial
                    nature, however, is sometimes too apparent. Academic changes that were largely products of their
                    times are likely to be too closely attributed to a particular dean or president. The treatment of
                    extracurricular life of women students might well have focused more on them and less on the dean of
                    women.
            Within this context, however, the book is worthy of the appreciative audience which it will have. At
                    some future time, when the golden age of escalation of higher education can be viewed in
                    perspective, more definitive philosophical conclusions can be attempted with respect to all current
                    educational efforts.

                        Minnesota
                     has a mild, middle of the road reputation. Its scenery, wildlife, cities, and politics
                    hardly arouse feverish emotions. Even the Vikings, the state's professional football team,
                    seem quiet, well behaved fellows. And visitors to the state can stay indoors when the weather turns
                        really cold.
            Belying the public image of the state, the autobiographical essays contained in Growing
                        Up in 
                            Minnesota
                        
                are intense, sharply etched, and extremely varied reports of life in the
                    Gopher State. Correspondent Harrison Salisbury, poets Robert Ely and Gerald Vizenor, writers Meridel
                    Le Sueur and Shirley Schoonover, Kierkegaard scholar Howard Hong, and  the other contributors emphasize the particularity of their youths.
            For example, the young black writer Toyse Kyle, brought up in poverty in 
                        Minneapolis
                    , brings her account around to the night her mother tried to kill the two of them by
                    pulling her off a 
                        Minneapolis
                     bridge into the 
                        Mississippi
                    . Vizenor, an American Indian, quotes the police officials who explained why they had
                    never found the killer who slashed his father to death in 1936: "We never spent much time
                    on winos and derelicts in those days … who knows, one Indian vagrant kills
                    another" (p. 81).
            Meridel Le Sueur's memories are of her parents' radical doings in the 
                        Iowa
                     and 
                        Minnesota
                     of sixty years ago. "They lived through many progressive movements, gave their
                    lives to them, and never called anything defeat" (p. 37). She recalls "huge
                    picnics where whole families and villages came in buckboards, the women setting out a rich feast and
                    singing, ‘The Farmer Is the Man that Feeds Us All,’ ‘The Battle
                    Hymn of the Republic,’ and sometimes The People's Flag Is Deepest Red, It Waves
                    above Our Martyred Dead.’ If you never heard the people singing together when you were a
                    young person, shaking like an aspen in the thunder of history, then you can't imagine these
                    political bacchanals in the cotton-wood groves …" (pp. 39–40).
            Robert Ely, born in 
                  Madison, Minnesota
               , speaks of "the Norwegian-American culture
                    of the farms, where the social tone is a maddening cheerfulness, with no one ever admitting to being
                    depressed or suicidal. No serious conflicts are ever found between separate areas of church
                    doctrine, nor between capitalist practice and Christian practice. Only the oldest settlers, born in 
                        Norway
                    , and socialists when they came, went around muttering in indignation at the latest news
                    of corporate takeover" (p. 211).
            A few themes emerge and re-emerge through the essays. The most significant is the centrality of the
                    baffling, irreconcilable tragedies and cruelties in the history of this happy and successful state:
                    the rape of the environment, the theft of the land from the Indians, the daily cruelties still
                    visited on Indians and blacks. Growing Up in 
                            Minnesota
                        
                reveals a different 
                        Minnesota
                    —more varied, more deeply experienced, less perfected—than Time magazine depicted in its famous (to Minnesotans) cover story about the state
                    some years ago.
            
            But precisely because of their honesty, these essays are absorbing and affirmative commentaries on
                    the history and culture of

            These books are intended as companions to Robert Howard's 
                  
                            Illinois
                        : A History of the 
                            Prairie
                         State (1972). Many selections are drawn from older publications of the 
                        Illinois
                     State Historical Society and Library as well as other out of print materials. This new
                    set should be especially helpful to 
                        Illinois
                     History classes in the newly established community colleges that may not possess the
                    older works.
            Although the readings are balanced between original sources and excellent secondary materials written
                    by competent historians, the editor offers no insight into his selection criteria. Both volumes
                    concentrate on social history, often to the exclusion of political events and important Illinoisans
                    such as Adlai Stevenson, whose rhetoric captivated thousands.
            Editors, even when not working directly from documents, are obligated to inform readers how material
                    has been treated. Sutton has not done this, and the careful reader will be disturbed by a number of
                    irregularities. Punctuation and missing letters are sometimes silently corrected while in the same
                    document other missing punctuation has not been added. (II, pp. 33–37). In the Gershom
                    Flagg letters (I, pp. 140–44) there is no indication that the document is actually a
                    composite of three letters. It is impossible to distinguish between originally bracketed material
                    and that added by the editor. Transcription errors can be found through comparison with  the original publications. Regrettably most of the original footnotes
                    have been omitted.
            Each chronological volume is divided into topical groups which are briefly introduced. Original
                    narratives are preceded by short paragraphs putting them in perspective and providing sources for
                    further reading. Selections from secondary works are not accorded the same treatment even though
                    neither volume contains a bibliography. The abbreviated index is inadequate. One selection (I, pp.
                    187–98) discusses dress, textiles, music, and entertainment, although none of these
                    topics is included in the index.
            
               
                        Illinois
                     historians will be surprised that the editor ignores the opening of the Grand 
                        Prairie
                     area in the 1850s when he declares that "
                        Illinois
                     had passed out of the frontier stage of development" by 1846 (I, p. 157). Even
                    more interesting is his statement "No one anticipated civil war, at least not until 
                        Lincoln
                     and Douglas sounded the tocsin on the slavery issue in their forensic exchange during
                    the 1858 senatorial election" (I, P. 157).
            Carefully edited readings serve a useful function within the academic community or simply provide an
                    interesting overview to the general reader. When quality selections are included in attractive
                    volumes, well illustrated with maps and pictures, it is regrettable that the editor and publisher
                    did not exercise more care in the editorial process.

            This is a study of institutional culture—as well as cultural
                    philanthropy—during 
                        Chicago
                    's passage into the twentieth century. The author excludes commercial ventures
                    which turned a profit and local or neighborhood cultural endeavors; but she deals deftly with the
                    private, city wide cultural institutions, their founders and financial angels, their administrators,
                    and their changing sense of purpose.
            The philanthropists include Charles Hutchinson, Martin Ryerson, Edward Ayer, Harlow Higinbotham, and
                    Franklin  MacVeagh. They and their associates were usually
                    native born Protestants of British ancestry, and most of them had ties with New 
                        England
                    . Successful in business and already wealthy, they worried about their inability to
                    control city politics and the sudden, explosive growth of 
                        Chicago
                    . They created the cultural institutions "as ways of sustaining their sense of
                    the good life" (p. 68). At the same time "they sought to redirect their
                    city's values and preoccupations, to lift 
                        Chicago
                     from materialism to the realm of spirit" (p. 69). It was their civic duty to
                    establish the Art Institute, New-berry and Crerar libraries, 
                        Chicago
                     Symphony Orchestra, Field Columbian Museum, and University of 
                        Chicago
                    . Founders, administrators, and customers agreed that these cultural emporiums should be
                    educational and uplifting rather than popular or entertaining.
            The museums and libraries were no sooner launched than they ran into criticism. Local artists
                    demanded recognition and patronage. Novelists Henry Blake Fuller and Robert Herrick, though personal
                    friends of the philanthropists, challenged the latter's motives and assumptions. Social
                    reformers like Jane Addams and John Dewey wanted the cultural institutions to reach out to lower
                    income Chicagoans through neighborhood schools and branch libraries. These critics, Horowitz argues,
                    sold the cultural institutions on the idea of outreach. The administrators shifted their attention
                    from efficiency to service. Museums and galleries added contemporary and sometimes experimental art
                    to their collections. The philanthropists turned into salesmen for the progressive ideal of making
                    culture accessible to all citizens.
            Horowitz makes a persuasive case for the flexibility of the cultural institutions and the receptivity
                    of 
                        Chicago
                     businessmen to new currents of thought. Quite correctly she claims that her study will
                    have "implications beyond its specific locale" (p. xi). Historians of 
                        Chicago
                     will welcome Culture & the City as a tool for explaining why
                    visitors found the place "a strange combination of pork and Plato" (p. ix). One
                    word of warning: readers who also use libraries should be prepared for the depressing fact that
                    average waiting time for delivery of a requested book at the Crerar Library in 1898 was 1.65
                    minutes.

            This is a thought provoking book. Its author, a native of 
                        Germany
                    , notes how shocked she was when she first perceived the landscape upon her arrival in
                    the American Middle West. Her reaction was that the "small towns were ugly and
                    uninteresting, and the rural landscape was appallingly monotonous" (p. [ii]). In time she
                    realized that the rectangular pattern for surveying land, established by the Land Ordinance of 1785
                    and subsequent enactments, constituted "a basic formative influence on the American
                    landscape" (p. [iii]). Johnson later concluded that most Americans and Canadians accept
                    this survey system "as natural, inevitable, or perhaps in some inscrutable way, divinely
                    ordained" (p. [i]). The author focuses on the result of this rectangular survey in what she
                    calls the upper Mississippi Hill Country (portions of 
                  Illinois, Iowa,
                            Wisconsin
               , and

                    ).
            
               Order Upon the Land presents an informative account of the development of the
                    rectangular system by which the bulk of the land of the 
                        United States
                     was surveyed. Attention is given to terms of sale, but the emphasis is on how the
                    surveying was done and its impact upon natural and environmental features and influences. Johnson
                    concludes that towns, farms, and roads have generally conformed more to base and meridian lines, and
                    the endless congressional townships cut therefrom, than to hills, lakes, rivers, and other natural
                    features. The resulting landscape pattern, especially discernable when flown over on a clear night,
                    reflects the basic rectangular or grid system established by the original federal survey. Johnson
                    offers useful pictures and maps which illustrate ways in which this survey has modified the natural
                    landscape pattern.
            Johnson is correct in thinking that Americans should give more attention to protecting and preserving
                    the natural landscape. Although not created in heaven, the rectangular survey system, however,
                    should not be confined to purgatory to do pennance without a full awareness of its contributions and
                    an equally full consideration of its alternatives. It has 
                    contributed immensely to the development of the American economy and to the reduction of disputes
                    about land titles. Although the system has large room for improvement, much of the beauty of the
                    American landscape remains, and resourceful innovations can make the rectangular survey increasingly
                    compatible with the natural landscape when such is feasible and desirable.

                            Iowa
                        
               . By Robert P. Swierenga. (

            Why had no monograph been done on late nineteenth century delinquent tax auctions when the folklore
                    view was that "tax liens were an instrument of war against speculators"? Swierenga
                    answers that question indirectly in this book, which required numerous assistants to ferret out the
                    diverse and almost inaccessible data, the use of computer programmers from three institutions, and a
                    narrative that accounts for only 103 pages of the work. Notes cover almost half as many pages, and
                    figures, tables, and appendixes bulk more than the narrative itself.
            In 
                        Iowa
                    , Swierenga finds that his preconceptions were not supported by available fact. The last
                    four decades of the nineteenth century saw county treasurers auctioning off more than two hundred
                    thousand tax liens, producing overall about 2 percent of the total taxes. This study, which
                    concentrated on rural tax liens, shows that the tax buyers operated primarily as "a money
                    lending operation; they 'stood in' for delinquent property owners at the
                    treasurer's pay window" (p. 17). Tax title was based on state law and not on
                    common law, and tax buyers were attracted by as much as 40 percent return from their investment.
                    Their action was described as a government managed loan agency for the benefit of local farmers.
                    Their intent was not to acquire the land but to reap the higher than legal rate of interest
                    permitted on tax liens.
            In view of the critical comment found in many contemporary accounts about the tax buyers, the
                    collective biography  of identifiable 
                        Iowa
                     tax buyers is interesting. As a group they were "professional land
                    capitalists—bankers, lawyers, realtors, and loan agents—who not only resided
                    in the county-seat towns, but also dominated the local governments" (p. 57). One served as
                    governor of 
                        Iowa
                    , and several were sent to Congress by the voters. All were respectable citizens and
                    leading public officials who must have served a critical need to both tax collectors and tax paying
                    citizens. Their role changed in the twentieth century when limited interest charges on tax liens
                    reduced the attraction of this form of investment.
            James S. Easley, a 
                        Virginia
                     land capitalist, with whom Swierenga dealt extensively in his Pioneers and
                        Profits (1968) is also here as a tax buyer, and there were a few other out of state buyers.
                    Generally, however, the local nature of the business and the extensive record keeping necessary gave
                    advantages to county seat capitalists. The author concludes that the tax auction mechanism served
                    "two community needs: regular government revenue and private development capital"
                    (p. 103). Seldom did "acres for cents" produce land titles: instead they were
                    "security for tax certificates."
            This pioneering study should serve as a splendid model for similar projects in other states.

               Adams and Jefferson: A Revolutionary Dialogue. By Merrill D. Peterson. (
                        Athens
                    : The University of 
                        Georgia
                     Press, 1976. Pp. xiv, 146. Illustrations, notes, index. $7.00.)
            When reviewing the work of a master historian one expects sound scholarship, mature judgment, and a
                    felicitous style. Merrill D. Peterson, author of the best single volume biography of Thomas
                    Jefferson, more than satisfies these criteria in this book.
            In four essays first delivered at Mercer University in 1975, Peterson traces the famous fifty year
                    correspondence between John Adams and Jefferson. But Peterson does much more than narrate the story
                    of a fascinating and complex friendship. His study has a far more important purpose: it is an
                    analysis of "the dialogue of ideas through which  these
                    two philosopher-statesmen carried forward the ongoing search for the meaning and purpose of the
                    American Revolution" (p. 1).
            Adams and Jefferson had much in common, but Peterson believes that the differences between them were
                    more important. While both men were ardent revolutionaries, each held opposite views of human
                    nature; therefore, each advanced different theories of governmental organization. Adams was a
                    Hobbesian. Man was evil, and the division of society into classes was the natural result of
                    man's self interest. Government existed to restrain man's evil tendencies and to
                    maintain social order. The balanced constitution with upper and lower classes checking each other
                    through separate but equal branches was best suited for this purpose. Jefferson, on the other hand,
                    was a disciple of the Enlightenment. Man was basically good and naturally sought the good of others.
                    Thus he advocated a government which was limited in its ability to regulate human affairs. Peterson
                    succinctly notes the difference between the two friends: "In Jefferson's view
                    government should be absorbed into society, becoming true self-government, while Adams believed that
                    society must be absorbed into government, reproduced in it, and regulated by it" (p. 20).
            This ideological divergence, present but muted in the Revolutionary struggle, became more pronounced
                    in the 1790s. The friends' contrasting responses to the French Revolution marked a critical
                    juncture in their political and personal relationship. Adams' fear of social disorder made
                    him view the Utopian violence of the French revolt as the logical consequence of democracy run
                    rampant. Jefferson had no such fear. He believed that the American Revolution was prologue to a new
                    world order; the French Revolution, while disappointing to the Virginian, "furthered his
                    education in democracy … and extended his vision of America's responsibility for
                    advancing the freedom of mankind" (p. 53).
            The friends parted company during the late 1790s as their ideological conflict became part of a
                    partisan struggle for political power. Yet Peterson notes that Jefferson's election in 1800
                    meant that the people had settled the conflict in the Virginian's favor.
                    Jefferson's optimism and his faith in the virtues of a democratic polity best suited
                    America's vision of its future. Adams, as he accurately  prophesied to Jefferson when their correspondence resumed in 1812, became a forgotten hero.
            
               Adams and Jefferson will be greeted enthusiastically both by scholars and by the
                    general public—and deservedly so. It is a superb addition to the bicentennial literature,
                    and together with The Adams-Jefferson Letters, edited by Lester J. Cappon, it will
                    become the starting point for anyone who desires to understand the relationship between these two
                    giants of the American Revolution.

               Perspectives on the American Revolution: Bicentennial Lectures. Edited by James

            This small book reproduces eight lectures presented by the Department of History, Indiana
                    University-Purdue University at 
                        Fort Wayne
                     in the fall of 1975. The purpose of the lectures was "to shed light on the
                    background of the American Revolution and its meaning for the 
                        United States
                     and other nations" (Preface). The topics are well suited to the stated
                    purpose, and they are well developed. Doubtless the series contributed, as was hoped, to "a
                    better public understanding of what it is that Americans are celebrating in these Bicentennial
                    years" (Preface).
            Inevitably the quality of this kind of book is uneven. Some of the writing is flawless, but there are
                    errors. The error is literary when one writes that "Franco … is strongly
                    anti-communist and that is sufficient justification to enamor him to us" (p. 103). It is
                    chronological when one declares it unlikely that either the American or the French Revolution
                    "would have … taken place without the other" (p. 137). It is
                    mathematical when, regarding the relation between revolution and frustrated expectations, one
                    asserts that "if you  start with zero and move to one,
                    you have improved 100 percent …" (p. 115). Extensive documentation raises
                    additional questions. If the book was aimed at scholarly readers, the writers should not have relied
                    on survey textbooks in world history for authority; if it was intended for popular consumption,
                    quotations should have been translated into English.
            Those who presented this series are to be commended for what must have been a very worthwhile local
                    bicentennial event. It is doubtful, however, that publication of these lectures, which offer little
                    that is new, was needed.

               Pathway to the National Character, 1830–1861. By Robert Lemelin. (
                        Port Washington
                    , N.Y.: Kennikat Press, 1974. Pp. 154. Bibliography, index. $8.50.)
            This little book, published early in 1975, promises a great deal more than it delivers. Using as his
                    sources travel accounts and works of descriptive writers during the three decades before the Civil
                    War, Lemelin sets out to demonstrate that one of the most important themes in these multifaceted
                    accounts is an American culture struggling for the first time to define its identity. A sense of
                    cultural identity did in fact begin to emerge in that period, Lemelin further contends, and it has a
                    validity for Americans even now.
            Any book that deals with that will-o'-the-wisp, "national character," is
                    likely to be the subject of criticism, but Lemelin's failures are only partly attributable
                    to the profound and inherent difficulty of the general subject with which he deals. In large part
                    the problems in the present study are the result of the very questionable assumptions with which
                    Lemelin begins. In the first place, many students of early American culture would seriously doubt
                    that "the culture began consciously to wrestle with defining the national
                    character" (p. 3) only in the years from 1831 to 1860. Actually that quest for national
                    identity began much, much earlier. Moreover, one has to wonder if travel and descriptive literature
                    is a better place to go for clues about national character formation than sermons, orations,
                    eulogies, newspapers, and popular fiction. There were certainly other sources closer  to grass roots opinion than were travel and descriptive accounts.
            Lemelin's book largely turns out to be an account, at times somewhat tedious, of the great
                    variety of things with which the travel and descriptive writers themselves dealt. "One
                    finds tall tales and other types of American humor in travel literature" (p. 76).
                    "Accounts of legends dealing with heroism in the French and Indian and Revolutionary wars
                    were popular with travel writers" (p. 77). "Local color material was consciously
                    gathered" (p. 78). "Western social refinements were cried up by writers, and
                    discussion of the rough edges was often avoided" (p. 85). "Travel writers advised
                    immigrants, after securing their survival, to acquire cultural institutions as rapidly as
                    possible" (p. 88). "It is not surprising then to find writers telling readers to
                    grow corn, not dig for gold, to buy a farm and get away from the crowded city" (p. 95).
                    Although Lemelin does at times stop long enough to provide a pithy and useful commentary on what is
                    being revealed by this emphasis or that, such insights are not frequent enough. Certainly he has not
                    woven his raw material in such a way as to reveal that "Unified Cultural Self"
                    which is the subject of his next to the last chapter.
            In short, written both without footnotes and without that kind of tight overall conceptual framework
                    that might have given the necessary unity to such multifaceted material, this work contributes
                    little to the knowledge of the difficult subject of American national character formation.
                    "It is the purpose of this book," Lemelin states, "to remove the veils
                    and to get at essential cultural design as valid for understanding ourselves today as they were
                    during the antebellum period" (p. 4). Unfortunately, most of the veils still remain.

            This slender study is based primarily on four

                     speeches, two of which—the 
                        Gettysburg
                     Address and the Second Inaugural Address—are very short and very well  known. Glen E. Thurow discusses only the ideas in the speeches,
                    not their context, and he discusses them more or less as pure ideas.
            Though short, the book is annoyingly repetitious. The chapter on the

                     Address, for example, begins by printing that speech in full. Thurow then repeatedly
                    quotes and paraphrases passages which can surely be remembered from their full quotation a few pages
                    before. The explications of simple 
                        Lincoln
                     texts are occasionally not explications at all but repetitions, as when (p. 84) the
                    author treats these famous words: "But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot
                    consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have
                    consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract." It does not help much to be
                    told that Lincoln's words mean: "When one turns from our actions to theirs, ours
                    pale. We cannot dedicate, consecrate, hallow this ground."
            Although the study deals with a historical figure, this book is not a history book at all. Thurow
                    treats 
                        Lincoln
                     as a prophet rather than as a president, politician, and practicing lawyer. It is
                    symptomatic of the author's approach that the bibliography entitled "Writings
                    About 
                        Lincoln
                     and the Civil War" contains The Rhetoric of Aristotle. To be
                    sure, Thurow is a political scientist and not a historian, but this is no excuse for ignoring
                    historical context and chronology. He takes 
                        Lincoln
                    's thought as monolithic despite the fact that practically all modern scholars
                    agree that Lincoln's career was marked by "growth."
            The book argues that the "principles of the Declaration [of Independence] that claimed to be
                    complete and self-evident had to be transformed so that men would be open to higher
                    principle" (p. 117). Thurow claims that Lincoln made that transformation by changing the
                    doctrines of Thomas Jefferson from self evident truths into "propositions" to be
                    proved. This strained interpretation lays great emphasis on 
                        Lincoln
                    's saying at 
                        Gettysburg
                     that the 
                        United States
                     was dedicated to the "proposition" that all men are created equal.
                    Thurow fudges 
                        Lincoln
                    's letter which proclaimed that the "principles of Jefferson are the
                    definitions and axioms of free society" (p. 73). He does find a very interesting reference
                    to Charles Sumner's dismay that Lincoln chose the word "proposition," but
                    he finds it in a rather undistinguished 
                        Lincoln
                     biography  and does not attempt to verify the story
                    by reference to Sumner's works or David Donald's biography of Sumner. This
                    ignoring of standards of historical evidence is indicative of Thurow's approach. When he
                    says that the principles of Jefferson "had to be transformed," he means it in a
                    normative or mystical sense. History and the historical figure of Abraham 
                        Lincoln
                     are merely put at the service of this moral demand.

               From Centennial to World War: American Society, 1876–1917. By Walter
                    T. K. Nugent. (
                        Indianapolis
                    : The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Inc., 1977. Pp. xv, 249. Notes, bibliography, index.
                    Paperbound, $5.50.)
            This is the third volume to be published in the Bobbs-Merrill History of American
                        Society series. The purpose of the series, and of each volume, is to break away from the
                    historian's common preoccupation with political history and to provide a conceptually
                    expanded view of American social development. This formidable task requires covering a wide spectrum
                    of topics, sketching out the interrelationships among them, and integrating ostensibly discrete
                    developments into a meaningful synthesis. Synthesis construction of this sort normally depends for
                    information and insight upon a large body of specialized studies, but the very topics directly
                    relevant to an analysis of American social change are precisely the ones that have been most
                    neglected by historians. The authors in this series, then, must sail through uncharted waters and
                    make maximum use of their skills to fit together the pieces of the past social mosaic. Few authors
                    could confront these challenges successfully. Even fewer could produce an analytically sophisticated
                    and gracefully written synthesis. Walter T. K. Nugent has done both. The result is an informative,
                    readable, and intellectually stimulating overview of American society.
            The four decades between the nation's centennial celebration and its entry into World War I
                    witnessed enormous demographic, economic, and social change. How such changes  —in population composition, residential and occupational
                    structures, communications and transportation networks, patterns of social and economic
                    organization—impacted traditional institutions and values is the central question to
                    which Nugent directs his attention. His answer is at once imaginative and provocative. He posits a
                    shift from the laissez faire negativism and rampant individualism of the Gilded Age to an
                    evolutionary pragmatism and a developing sense of social consciousness in the first decades of the
                    twentieth century. To be sure, Nugent does not fall prey to the common error of arguing that such
                    modes of thought were universally diffused across all levels of society. His explicit focus is on
                    what he defines as the middle class—i.e., the white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, property
                    owning sector of the social structure.
            In presenting a synthesis with such sweep, Nugent has also created something of a
                    nitpicker's paradise. Specialists on any one of the dozens of discrete topics that Nugent
                    integrates into his stimulating synthesis will likely be dissatisfied that their area of concern has
                    not been explored in greater depth and with more attention to subtle nuance. Some will draw
                    attention to glaring omissions; e.g., there is a discussion (pp. 137–42) of the ways in
                    which "progressive intellectuals" transmitted their ideas to the larger society,
                    but no mention of the expansion of press associations, the increasing use by local newspapers of
                    wire news, and the impact of these shifts on the range and quality of information available to most
                    citizens. Still others will quarrel with some of the specifics of Nugent's interpretation.
                    The early twentieth century efforts by "middle class" progressives to restrict the
                    electoral franchise and to erode the functions of political parties seem, for example, rather self
                    consciously aimed at reversing the widespread citizen participation in politics that had
                    characterized most of the nineteenth century. Moreover, those efforts were only one side of a
                    multifaceted attempt by corporate-capitalist elites to control their society. The success of those
                    efforts, and the later emergence of interest group pluralism as the dominant mode of political
                    aggregation, depended in the first instance upon the demobilization and
                    "departisanization" of the mass electorate. Nugent fails to draw out such
                    connections and implications because he focuses too exclusively, and somewhat imprecisely, on the
                    allegedly "middle class" character of "progressivism."
            
            Yet it is only because Nugent has done so much, and so well, that he lays himself open to such
                    criticism. For it is the nature of synthesis to treat with commonalities, rather than subtle
                    shadings of distinction; to ignore some topics, while creating a framework for their subsequent
                    interpretation; and to present a cogent and unambiguous argument, even at the risk of highlighting
                    anomalies resistant to paradigm integration. On these critical counts From Centennial
                        to World War is preeminently successful, and the penetrating quality of its analysis puts
                    it on the level of the earlier syntheses by Samuel P. Hays and Robert Wiebe. With Nugent's
                    analysis of how the American middle class responded to industrialism and searched for order, the
                    level of the intellectual dialogue over the impact of modernization has been considerably elevated.

               The Healers: The Rise of the Medical Establishment. By John Duffy. (
                        New York
                    : McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1976. Pp. ix, 385. Notes, bibliography, index.
                    $12.50.)
            John Duffy has made a brave attempt to write a one volume history of medicine in the 
                        United States
                    . Proceeding chronologically and topically, Duffy draws upon more than three decades of
                    research and writing to survey more than three centuries of scientific and technical advances which,
                    in conjunction with institutional developments and reforms, enabled medicine to achieve the
                    preeminence that it enjoys today among the professions.
            The book covers a staggering amount of ground. The changing popular image and social status of
                    physicians, the efforts to license and organize them, the evolution of medical education, the impact
                    of various wars on medicine, the growth and decline of medical sects, the emergence of the public
                    health movement, and the rise of scientific medicine are but a few examples of the topics treated.
                    Reflecting an awareness of the new social history, Duffy even devotes a chapter (albeit meager) to
                    women and minorities in medicine.
            Approximately two thirds of the book is devoted to medical developments prior to 1900, a fact which
                    necessarily results in a discussion of modern medicine that is too brief.  Duffy's long standing interest in colonial and nineteenth
                    century medicine may account for the book's emphasis on these earlier periods, but,
                    whatever the reason, the result is a skewed presentation. If the book's central theme, as
                    the subtitle would seem to suggest, is to trace the rise of the medical establishment, why is so
                    little space devoted to the century that witnessed the rationalization of the medical profession and
                    more scientific and technical advances in medicine than all of the centuries that preceded it?
            At times the book threatens to succumb to what can be called "the great man
                    syndrome" in medicine. Far too much of the narrative is spent introducing physicians who
                    made minor contributions to medicine or who were merely prominent practitioners of their profession.
                    Medical history as a genre has traditionally suffered from a tendency to substitute chronicle for
                    analysis. Duffy's parade of mentionable notables suggests that he has not escaped this
                    pitfall.
            One final criticism is in order: the book is decidedly discipline bound. Anthropologists,
                    sociologists, and philosophers have contributed theories and insights that have enriched the
                    understanding of the interaction between medicine and society. Since one of Duffy's
                    objectives is "to view medicine objectively and place it in its social setting"
                    (p. v), one could wish that he had tapped the resources of other disciplines.
            The above objections notwithstanding, Duffy has written an important book, one which is distinguished
                    by profound learning. It offers sharp insights, well reasoned generalizations, and wise judgments.
                    Far from being seduced by a profession which he clearly respects and admires, Duffy maintains a
                    healthy skepticism toward medicine's knee jerk conservatism on most social issues. His
                    concluding chapter on medicine today should be required reading of every physician.

                    $4.95.) From 1915 to 1933 the Midland was one of the several
                    "little magazines" devoted to promoting regional literature, particularly to
                    freeing midwestern authors from the dominance of 
                        New York
                     publishers. Reigelman focuses on the magazine's editorial operations, under
                    the direction of John T. Frederick, and on its contributors and their work. His account provides an
                    interesting and informative view of what was doubtless the high point of twentieth century regional
                    literature.
            
               The Complete Motorist. By Elwood Haynes. Reprint. ([

                        Elwood
                     Haynes, automobile pioneer and gifted metallurgist, was a prolific writer, but he
                    published only one book. Happily, this volume, albeit slim and promotional, has now been made
                    available again. The original appearance of The Complete Motorist in 1914 was
                    largely the product of the Haynes Automobile Company's new and aggressive advertising
                    department, but it carried long passages from the pen of Haynes as he described his twenty  year automotive career and reviewed the mechanical development
                    of the automobile in America during that time. The book had a double purpose—to explain
                    the mechanical, electrical, metallurgical, and operational details of the modern motor car and to
                    serve as an owner's manual for the 1914 Hayneses (Models 26, 27, and 28), which featured an
                    electric gearshift operated by buttons on the steering wheel, making the mysteries of gearshifting
                    "as simple as ringing a door bell" (p. 54). General sales manager George H. Strout
                    contributed an introduction (and unquestionably much more) to the volume, which also contained
                    Haynes' most extreme statements regarding his priority in the development of the automobile
                    and touched off a long and noisy debate with Charles Duryea and others on the still unresolved
                    subject. The Haynes-Apperson Festival directors are to be congratulated for reissuing this work,
                    complete with its remarkable illustrations of construction details. Ralph D. Gray,

                    Research Project and other oral history sources available at Indiana University. Many of the
                    interviews were conducted by Thomas D. Clark and his associates in preparation for writing a history
                    of the university. Other interviews relate to the Indiana limestone industry, the history of 
                        Spencer
