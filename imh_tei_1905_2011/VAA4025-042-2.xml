               </placeName>, the Dakotas, and other trans-Mississippian states experienced in
                    the 1890's an agrarian crusade of tremendous proportions. Indiana went through a similar
                    period of agrarian radicalism in the 1870's. In both cases demands for monetary inflation
                    loomed large in the program of economic amelioration. It is the purpose of this article to trace one
                    aspect of agrarian radicalism in Indiana —the history of the inflation movement in the
                    state during the 1870's and the 1880's. This movement in Indiana never became as
                    evangelical or as spectacular as the free-silver agitation of the 1890's in the West and
                    the South, but it was persistent and in many ways similar. And like the later and more colorful
                    movement, it largely failed and was not able to check the relentless trend toward an industrial and
                    a conservative economy.</p>
            <p>The legal tender outstanding in 1865 amounted to $433, 000,000, and $145 of it
                    exchanged for $100 in gold. The contraction bill advocated in April, 1866, by Hugh
                    McCulloch was passed by both houses of Congress and became a. law. This act authorized the
                    retirement of $10,000,000 of the legal tender within six months and after that
                    $4,000,000 a month. The issue thus presented was as yet little understood by the voters
                    of Indiana, and the positions taken by the various members of the Indiana delegation in Congress
                    were not clarifying. Senator Henry S. Lane, Republican, voted for contraction, while Senator Thomas
                    A. Hendricks, Democrat, was significantly absent. Michael C. Kerr, Democrat, representative from the
                    second district, voted for the <list type="footnotes">

                    Niblack, the Democratic representative from the first district, did not vote. The remaining members
                    of the delegation were Republicans, and of these John H. Farquhar of the fourth district, Thomas N.
                    Stillwell of the eleventh district, and Henry D. Washburn of the seventh district voted for
                    contraction; Ralph Hill of the third district, George W. Julian of the fifth district, Joseph H.
                    Defrees of the tenth district, and Godlove S. Orth of the eighth voted against contraction; while
                    Ebenezer Dumont of the sixth and Schuyler Colfax of the ninth did not vote.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    Julian was later counted as a hard-money man, but it must be remembered that many conservatives,
                    including John Sherman of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, voted against the act of 1868, believing that the country was not yet ready for
                    contraction, and that McCulloch's schemes were premature. The large number of dodgers
                    showed that sentiment in Indiana had not yet crystallized, and that it was not considered
                    politically safe to be on either side. Opinion as yet was unformulated. The three affirmative votes
                    offset the three negative votes.</p>
            <p>In the midst of the depression of 1868, Congress by law ordered contraction to cease. The amount of
                    outstanding legal tender had been reduced to $365,000,000. The bill putting an end to
                    contraction passed the House on December 7, 1867, and every one of the ten Indiana representatives
                    who voted cast his ballot in the affirmative. The three Democrats, Niblack, Kerr, and Holman, all of
                    whom later became conservative on the money question, voted with the seven Republicans in favor of
                    the bill. Speaker Colfax was in the chair and was the only Indiana member who did not vote. The bill
                    passed the Senate on January 15, 1868, and both Morton and Hendricks voted for it.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Morton was avid in his support of the bill. Opinion in the Indiana delegation was thus
                    unanimous, and sentiment in Indiana seems to have been overwhelmingly against contraction. Both
                    parties in Indiana in 1868 wanted the greenbacks restored.</p>

                    the state.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> But after 1866, Oliver P. Morton opposed McCulloch on every
                    important issue, becoming a leader of the radical reconstructionists in the Senate after his
                    election to that body in 1867, and a spokesman for the Western Republicans who favored cheap money.
                    So savage did Morton become in opposition to sound money that Daniel W. Voorhees, who became the
                    most conspicuous inflationist in the Democratic party, was wont to use in his own speeches
                    quotations from Morton's fulminations against hard money, and long after the Republican
                    party in Indiana had abandoned cheap money, Voorhees delighted to taunt his adversaries with the
                    vigorous inflation arguments uttered over and over again by the great Republican idol. Voorhees was
                    especially fond of quoting from Morton's speech in opposition to the Public Credit Act of
                    1869 in which the great Republican leader declared that "it would be foul injustice to the
                    government and people of the <placeName>

                    to propose to make a new contract for the benefit of the bondholders."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                    It was Morton, not McCulloch, who expressed the aspirations of the Republicans of the state in the
                    years immediately following the Civil War.</p>
            <p>The state platform of the Republicans in 1868 was rankly radical on the money question. The platform
                    declared that <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>the large and rapid contraction of the currency, sanctioned by the votes of the Democratic
                            party in both Houses of Congress, has had a most injurious effect upon the industry and
                            business of the country; and it is the duty of Congress to provide by law for supplying the
                            deficiency in legal tender notes, commonly called greenbacks, to the full extent required by

            <p>The Democrats entered the campaign of 1868 with a radical financial platform. It declared that:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The national bank system, organized in the interests of the bondholders, ought to be

            <p>On each of the first six ballots for a presidential candidate, Indiana cast a solid block of thirteen
                    votes for Pendleton. On the seventh ballot, while Pendleton was still the leading candidate before
                    the convention, and while he was still increasing his strength and adding to his total vote, Indiana
                    broke away from him, giving nine and one-half votes to her favorite son, Thomas A. Hendricks. It was
                    the first break from Pendleton, and it occurred in a Western delegation. <placeName>

                    candidate was checked, and Indiana, an inflationist state, produced the situation which destroyed
                    all chances for the nomination of an inflationist. At the close of the eighteenth ballot

                    reconstruction. Grant carried Indiana over Seymour by a majority of 9,572, but Baker's lead

            <p>Agrarian conditions were slightly better in 1872 than they had been in 1870, but ad a general thing
                    the depression continued. Wheat rose to $1.26 in 1871 and to $2.32 in 1872.
                    Corn fell to thirty-seven cents in 1871 and lo twenty-nine cents in 1872. Rye was seventy cents in
                    1870 and sixty-five cents in 1872. Barley was eighty-three cents in 1870 arid sixty-nine cents in
                    1872. Buckwheat was seventy-one cents in 1870 and eighty-five cents in 1872. Hay was
                    $11.46 in 1870 and $12.53 in 1872.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Corn, oats, and
                    potatoes, however., were lower, and corn was Indiana's leading crop.</p>
            <p>The Democrats and Liberal Republicans fused in 1872. The Democrats were divided on the question of
                    fusion, and the party leaders were uneasy. Greeley was an advocate of sound money, and a majority of
                    the seceding Republicans were of like faith. In Indiana the leading Liberal Republican was George W.
                    Julian, and on the money question he was conservative. In order not to offend their new Republican
                    allies, therefore, the Democratic state platform of 1872 avoided all mention of the money question.
                    Instead, the Democrats emphasized the corruption of the Grant administration and the iniquities of
                    radical reconstruction in the South. The platform was virtually a reiteration of that written by the
                    Liberal Republicans at <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>No such unduly pressing practical need compelled the Republicans to be so wary, but the national
                    Republican administration was conservative, and consequently, the Republican platform was even more
                    conservative than it had been in 1870, notwithstanding the survival of a large radical element in
                    the Republican party of Indiana. The Republicans virtually declared that the situation existing was
                    satisfactory to them and endorsed the conservative policy of the administration as typified by
                    Boutwell's conduct of the Treasury Department. The platform declared that "the
                    adherence of Congress and the administration to the present financial policy —in spite of
                    the hostility of political opponents—has been fully justified by the payments made on the
                    public debt, and in the stability, security and increased confidence it has given to all the
                    business affairs of the country." No currency plank <list type="footnotes">

            <p>There was no great amount of enthusiasm for Grant in Indiana, but there was none for Greeley. Joseph
                    E. McDonald flatly refused to support the <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> editor, and Daniel Voorhees felt
                    that it was almost sacrilege to do so. Hendricks was the Democratic candidate for governor, and he
                    was personally very popular. Thomas M. Browne, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, was known to
                    be intemperate, and this lost him many votes. Hendricks carried the state by 1,148 votes, but the
                    General Assembly was Republican on joint ballot by a majority of twelve, and this assured the
                    re-election of Morton to the Senate. The Democratic candidate for State Superintendent of Public
                    Instruction was the only Democrat elected with Hendricks.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>The people were restless, there was widespread economic discontent, and it seems that if the
                    Democrats had divorced themselves entirely from the Liberal Republicans and had boldly put out a
                    Democratic ticket on an inflationist platform, that they would have stood a good chance to carry the
                    state. Instead they supported Greeley, paraded Carl Schurz up and down the state,<hi rend="sup">21</hi> flooded the voters with the polemics of Julian, alienated thousands of strict party
                    Democrats, and emphasized political issues which never caught fire. They called attention to the
                    grievances of the South without offering a remedy for the economic grievances of the Indiana farmer.
                    A single Voorhees, repeating the arguments for cheap money in a score of rural Hoosier settlements,
                    would have come much nearer to carrying the state for the Democrats.</p>
            <p>George W. Julian and Isaac P. Gray never returned after 1872 to the Republican fold. Henceforth both
                    acted with the Democratic party. Julian was a political liberal, but conservative on the money
                    question. Gray was more radical, and his views on financial questions were closer to those of
                    Voorhees, Turpie, Landers, and Williams than they were to those of McDonald, Kerr, and English.</p>

            <p>After the election of 1872, there was a growing feeling among the farmers of the state that both the
                    major parties had abandoned economic liberalism. The Republican platform of that year had endorsed
                    the fiscal policies of the Grant administration and had contained a plank only tepidly protesting
                    against any further grants of public lands to railroads. The Democratic party apparently had
                    abandoned its radicalism of 1868 and 1870, and not a single plank of its 1872 state platform
                    suggested methods of economic amelioration. Seemingly, the only alternative left to the farmer was
                    to organize independently of the two major parties.</p>
            <p>As agrarian discontent increased, the agricultural fraternity known as the Patrons of Husbandry or
                    the Grange grew in membership, power, and influence. The first Grange organized in the state
                    appeared near <placeName>

                    </placeName> on December 21, 1869. The State Grange of Indiana was organized on March 1, 1872, and
                    John Weir of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> became its first master. At the beginning of 1874, there were 423 Granges in Indiana;
                    in March there were 985; in June there were 1,409 with a membership of 53,141. By January, 1875,
                    there were 2,994 Granges organized, and by the middle of that year the State Grange paid the
                    national dues on 59,981 members.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> This represented the high water mark of the
                    organization in Indiana.</p>
            <p>At first the order confined itself to agricultural education, social diversion, and protection of the
                    farmer in his commercial dealings. By 1873, the Indiana Grange actively was engaged in a campaign
                    which had for its purpose the regulation of the railroads. In May, 1873, F. C. Johnson, a state
                    deputy of the Grangers, represented the Indiana Grange at the conference of the American Cheap
                    Transportation Society held in <placeName>

            <p>A severe financial panic occurred in 1873. Hog prices, which had hovered around six and seven dollars
                    since 1870, fell to $3.61. Wheat fell to $1.22 in the same year, and in 1874
                    fell to ninety-four cents. Corn, however, rose to forty cents in 1873 and to fifty-one cents in
                        1874.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> But despite this increase corn was still low in price, and the small
                    rise did not offset the greater losses sustained in wheat and hogs.</p>
            <p>Immediately, the old demand for more money was revived. A series of meetings held in <placeName>

                    independent party. These meetings were attended by prominent farmers and men influential in the
                    Grange. The moving spirits were E. A. Olleman, editor of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Farmer</hi>, who
                    possessed a genius for organization, and James Buchanan, the slashing editor of the <placeName>

                    later became the corner stone of the National Greenback party under the name of the
                    "Indiana Plan." These resolutions attributed the panic to lack of sufficient
                    circulating medium and declared it the duty of Congress to provide an elastic currency. They claimed
                    that persons possessing government bonds should be permitted to deposit them with the <placeName>

                    soon as he chose, redeem his bonds by returning the currency, no interest accruing on the bonds

            <p>The Greenback movement in Indiana has been exaggerated due to the great influence the Indiana
                    organization wielded in the founding and development of the National Greenback party. The
                    inflationist sentiment of Indiana expressed itself more effectively in the Democratic party, and,
                    while the Greenback organization furnished many original ideas which ultimately found expression in
                    Democratic platforms, as an active and effective political organization attaching to itself
                    widespread and popular support, it cannot be said to have been very successful in Indiana.</p>
            <p>Following the panic of 1873, the sentiment of the country was so strongly in favor of more money that
                    the Secretary of the Treasury was impelled. to change for bonds $26,000,000 of legal
                    tender which McCulloch withdrew but did not destroy, thus raising the amount outstanding to
                    $382,000,000. But public opinion, particularly in the West, demanded a still greater
                    inflation of the currency. The Senate passed a bill on April 6, 1874, to increase the outstanding
                    amount of legal tenders by $18,000,000. Oliver P. Morton led the forces supporting the
                    bill, and both he and Daniel B. Pratt, his Republican colleague, voted for it.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

            <p>The vote of the Indiana congressional delegation on resumption presented a most curious reversal of
                    conditions. In the Senate both Morton and Pratt voted for the measure. In the House nine of the

            <p>The Republicans had voted solidly for the Inflation Bill in 1874, yet eight months later they voted
                    solidly for resumption. This right-about-face is even more remarkable considering the strong
                    inflation sentiment in the state as manifested in the election of 1874. But nationally the
                    Republican party was becoming more and more conservative, and the congressional defeat of 1874
                    showed the party that it must make a choice between the East and the West. Already it had elected to
                    support an Eastern and an industrial economy. The tug of party loyalty was too much for the Indiana
                    Republicans: they capitulated.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> The vote of Orth for resumption was to plague

            <p>Niblack and Holman were personally conservative money men, and in 1874 they had voted against the
                    Inflation Bill. But the Indiana Democracy had become definitely inflationist, and Holman and Niblack
                    merely voted the sentiments expressed in the 1874 state platform of their party. Wolfe was an honest
                    inflationist, and he undoubtedly voted his sentiments.</p>
            <p>So encouraged were Buchanan and Olleman at the showing made by the radical forces in 1874 that they
                    decided to launch a movement looking toward the formation of a definite third-party organization.

                    "looking to the gradual retirement of the circulation of the national banks and the

                    an outstanding radical on the money question until the force of party loyalty had compelled him to
                    support the Specie Resumption Act. Inherently, he was an inflationist, and he must still have felt
                    that a policy of abundant money was the best one for the people of Indiana, most of whom were still

                    "The law for the resumption of specie payments on the first of January, 1879, having been
                    enacted by the Republican party without deliberation in Congress or discussion before the people,

            <p>On the two ballots taken to determine the presidential nomination, Indiana voted for Hendricks.
                    Strangely enough, in the light of his equivocal position on the money question, the support of
                    Hendricks came from Western states like IIlinois, <placeName>

                    in the West and South. The nominee of the convention was Samuel J. Tilden, who was an avowed
                    believer in sound money. Hendricks was nominated for vice-president, and the Indiana delegation,
                    which declared he was not a candidate for second place, acquiesced in his selection.<hi rend="sup">69</hi>

                            purposes; it draws no interest, twenty millions could be saved a year, and in forty years
                            the debt could be paid by this means alone and without inflation. The government can redeem
                            as fast as the banks can. … The greenbacks are the best currency we can get, and
                            on which you pay no interest. … It was said that the Democrats were not sincere
                            in their desire for the repeal of the resumption act. Our actions [in Congress] proved that
                            we were.</p>
                    </quote>Williams also criticized the demonetization of the silver dollar and declared that the

            <p>Orth withdrew as the Republican candidate on August 2. He was unpopular because he had voted for the
                    Specie Resumption Act. His wet proclivities were resented by the many temperance reformers in the
                    Republican party. The Democrats had been circulating an ugly allegation to the effect that Orth
                    personally had profited in the Venezuela bond irregularity which had occurred when he was the
                    American minister to that country, and in which many Americans had lost money. The state committee
                    substituted Benjamin Harrison as the Republican candidate. Harrison came out boldly against fiat
                    money. He was reserved and did not come into intimate contact with the plain people as Williams did.
                    The Democrats dubbed him "the kid glove candidate." The manner of his selection
                    offended the wets. The Germans resented the humiliation inflicted on one of their most
                    representative citizens. All of these factors contributed to the Republican defeat.</p>

                    taken in the interests of the Republican ticket. This unexpected withdrawal threw the Greenbackers
                    into confusion for a time, but they substituted Henry W. Harrington on the ticket, and seemed not to
                    have been injured by Wolcott's unexplained conduct. If the incident had any influence at

                    everrating the mint value of silver. Every member of the Indiana delegation in the House who cast a

                    </placeName> moved to amend it by striking out the free and unlimited feature and substituting
                    restriction. The Secretary of the Treasury was ordered to buy each month for coinage into silver
                    dollars, exclusive of coinage already issued, from two to four million dollars of silver, provided
                    the amount invested in silver at any time was not more than five million dollars. Voorhees voted
                    against the Allison amendment, thereby ranging himself with the forces of free and unlimited silver
                    coinage. McDonald voted for the restrictive amendment of Allison. Both Voorhees and McDonald voted
                    for the amended bill when it came up for final reading.<hi rend="sup">89</hi>

                    Calkins, Republican representative of the tenth district, voted against the amended bill. They were
                    extreme silverites and resented the mutilation of the original bill. Every other Indiana member
                    voted for the bill, believing that it represented the maximum concessions of a Republican Senate to
                    the cause of silver.</p>
            <p>Then Hayes vetoed the bill. Thus challenged by the conservatives, the three Indiana radicals who had
                    voted against the amended bill because they thought it too conservative, joined their Indiana
                    colleagues in voting to pass the bill over the executive veto. Every member of the Indiana
                    delegation in the House voted to override the veto. In the Senate both McDonald and Voorhees voted
                    against the President.<hi rend="sup">91</hi> The action of the Indiana delegation was thus
                    unanimous. Most of the delegation would rather have had the original Bland Bill, but if they could

                    them it seemed too conservative, engendered resentment.</p>
            <p>The year of 1878 was a year of intense depression. Corn fell as low as twenty-seven cents, the lowest
                    it ever fell in the 1870's and 1880's, and wheat dropped to eighty-one cents. Rye
                    went down to fifty-one cents and oats to twenty cents. The average price received for hay in Indiana
                    was $6.06 a ton. Hogs sold at an average of $2.97.<hi rend="sup">92</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the Republican stat:, platform of 1878 was somewhat equivocal, it was on the whole a
                    conservative declaration. It declared for "no abandonment or appreciation of the greenback
                    currency," yet at the same time it stood for "a sound and stable currency of gold,
                    silver, and paper of the same value" and came out in "opposition to repudiation in
                    all its forms," and in favor of "the honor and credit of the nation,"
                    which was "to be maintained in every contingency." Some liberal concessions
                    contained in the platform were a promise to work for "national legislation authorizing the
                    receipt of greenbacks at par in payment of customs and in purchase of government bonds,"
                    and a pledge to sponsor a law providing for "an increased exemption of property from
                        execution."<hi rend="sup">93</hi> The important thing to note is that by 1878 the
                    Republican party of Indiana had accepted without a single reservation every line of the Specie
                    Resumption Act.</p>
            <p>The confession of faith expressed in the Democratic platform of 1878 was as radical as any Greenback
                    declaration. That document contained the following radical demands: "The immediate and
                    unconditional repeal of the resumption, act"; the making of "the <placeName>

                    they were issued, expressly payable in coin"; "the restoration of the silver

                    of all debts, both public and private; and that the coinage thereof should be unlimited, and upon

                    planks favored such legislation as should fix the legal rate of interest at not exceeding six
                    percentum per annum and the repeal of the national bankrupt act. The platform also contained an
                    assertion that the right to issue paper money as well as coin is the exclusive prerogative of the
                    government, and that such money should be issued in such amounts as the sound business interests of

                    votes to 180,657 for the Republican candidate. The Greenback candidate for Secretary of State polled
                    39,415, a tremendous vote when one considers that the Democratic party was definitely radical on the
                    money question in 1878. The combined majority of the two inflation parties over the conservative
                    Republican party was 53,528. The Republican party polled 43.50 per cent of the votes while the
                    inflation parties polled 56.50 per cent. The Greenback party ran second in four counties.<hi rend="sup">95</hi>

            <p>This election constitutes radicalism's greatest victory, and 1878 represents the high water

                    that year the issue was as yet undefined, few understood it, and the question of reconstruction

            <p>A particularly radical resolution containing instructions to senators in Congress and a request to
                    Indiana representatives to vote for a law to prohibit the further issuing of interest-bearing
                    government bonds was lost by the very narrow margin of forty-three to forty-five. Another very
                    radical resolution which instructed and requested Indiana senators and representatives respectively
                    to vote for a federal law limiting the rate of interest to not over six per cent was lost by a vote
                    of twenty-seven to sixty-three. Another joint resolution adopted by the House instructed and
                    requested respectively that senators and representatives vote for a law reducing the salaries of
                    federal officials by one-half since "the present policy of the government has rendered the
                    price of labor and all kinds of farm products, as well as real estate, to about one-half its value
                    ten years ago."<hi rend="sup">104</hi> It is not difficult to see that the lower house of
                    the Indiana General Assembly of 1879 was radical and agrarian. These resolutions were not acted on
                    in the Senate.</p>
            <p>The legislature of 1879 sent Voorhees to the Senate for the full term of six years beginning March 4,
                    1879. Voorhees received eighty-three votes to sixty for the conservative Benjamin Harrison. James
                    Buchanan was the Greenback candidate, but he received the support of only three of the Greenback
                        legislators.<hi rend="sup">105</hi> The remainder voted for Voorhees. In the short time Voorhees
                    had been a member of the Senate, he had become one of the outstanding inflationists of that body,
                    and his election to the full term may be considered a distinct gain for the forces of cheap money in
                    national politics.</p>
            <p>The decline from the radical peak of 1878 was swift and decisive. A severe crop shortage occurred in
                    Europe in 1879, and the huge surplus produced in this country that year was sent to Europe to supply
                    the deficiency. We sold more than we bought. Gold and silver entered the country in abundance.
                    Specie resumption took place with lease, for it was not difficult to maintain a gold reserve when

            <p>Prosperity returned to the farmer. Corn rose to thirty-four cents in 1879; wheat to $1.17;
                    rye to seventy-one cents; oats to twenty-,eight cents; and hay to $9.84 a ton. By the
                    close of 1880 corn went to sixty cents; wheat to $1.27; rye to ninety-three cents; oats
                    to forty-two cents; barley to $1.05; buckwheat to ninety-nine cents; potatoes to
                    $1.06; and hay to $12.20.<hi rend="sup">106</hi> Returning prosperity
                    reflected itself in politics by a swing of the pendulum to conservatism.</p>
            <p>The Indiana Republicans in 1880 generally supported Blaine for the presidential nomination. Elaine
                    had always been an enemy of fiat money and was at that time the most brilliant protagonist of the
                    bourgeois philosophy of government. On the thirty-fourth ballot, twenty of the thirty Republican
                    delegates to the national convention voted for Blaine. The other ten votes were divided among John
                    Sherman, Elihu B. Washburrie, and Uslysses S. Grant, all of whom were conservative. On the
                    thirty-fifth ballot, twenty-seven of the Indiana delegates voted for James A. Garfield, who was also
                    conservative on the money question. For vice-president the Indiana delegates split their votes
                    principally between Washburne, Chester A. Arthur, and Marshall Jewell, all conservatives.<hi rend="sup">107</hi>

            <p>The Republican state platform of 1880 contained no specific mention of national issues; it merely
                    reaffirmed in a blanket endorsement the principles enunciated by the national platform adopted at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This latter platform took pride in the financial achievement of the Republican party,
                    which, it claimed, had raised paper money to the value of gold and caused government bonds to go to

            <p>The Democratic national platform of 1880 contained a plank declaring for "honest money,
                    consisting of gold and silver, and paper convertible into coin on demand," and to this the

                    1876. Voorhees placed Hendricks before the convention as Indiana's choice for the
                    presidency. On this occasion Voorhees lost much of his accustomed enthusiasm and ardor, and the
                    reason therefore is not difficult to divine. Aside from the thirty Indiana votes Hendricks received
                    only sporadic support.<hi rend="sup">109</hi>

                    was disliked by a large number of Indiana Democrats—many of the conservatives thought his
                    conduct during the war tainted with Republicanism, while to the economic radicals he was a Bourbon
                    of the Bourbons. The Indiana delegation acquiesced in his nomination when it was apparent that he
                    was the choice of a large section of the national Democracy.<hi rend="sup">110</hi> When an English
                    supporter wired Hendricks for an endorsement of his candidate the former governor sent this laconic
                    and tepid reply: "English is acceptable to Indiana"—another
                    illustration of the fact that brevity sometimes speaks volumes. During the course of the campaign,

            <p>During the course of the Democratic National Convention a considerable movement to make Joseph E.

                    from Hendricks a release of Indiana delegates proved futile, and so the chances of McDonald for the

            <p>Returning prosperity was an argument the Democrats could not overcome. The Republican organization
                    spent large sums of money to carry the state. Porter was elected by 231,405 votes to 224,452 for
                    Landers for the office of governor. Richard Gregg, the Greenback candidate, polled 14,881 votes. For
                    president, Garfield polled 232,164 votes or 49.32 per cent of the total votes; Winfield S. Hancock
                    polled 225,522 votes or 47.91 per cent of the total votes. The combined vote of the Democrats and
                    Greenbackers was 6,344 in excess of the Republican vote. The Greenbackers mustered about sixteen
                    thousand votes for nearly every candidate except the gubernatorial candidate, and their aspirant for
                    Superintendent of Public Instruction polled 16,730 votes. In the tenth district a union of
                    Greenbackers and Democrats was defeated by tbe straight Republican ticket. Radicalism had declined,

            <p>The boom of 1 879–1881 was abortive. The old depression settled down again in 1882. Corn
                    fell to forty-eight cents; wheat to ninety cents; and hay to $9.00 a ton.<hi rend="sup">117</hi> But the old inflation sentiment did not revive vigorously. Radical Democrats of the
                    state evidently felt that the nation at large accepted specie resumption as final. The silver

            <p>The Democratic platform of 1882 contained no financial planks, but voiced the usual opposition to
                    "sumptuary legislation." The Republican platform incidentally boasted that the
                    party had established "a currency equal to any in the world, based upon the convertibility
                    of greenbacks, and the national bank notes into gold and silver at the option of the

                    Secretary of State was 13,520 votes. In some localities the Democrats were more radical than their.
                    platform and the Democratic victory together with the fairly large Greenback vote are evidence of
                    continued dissent.</p>
            <p>The Democrats had eighty-six votes on joint ballot in the General Assembly; the Republicans had

            <p>The General Assembly was close. The Democrats had seventy-six on joint ballot and the Republicans

                    been elected on the Republican ticket. These were included in the Republican-Democratic lineup.
                    David Turpie, inflationist, was the Democratic caucus nominee for Senator. Benjamin Harrison,
                    conservative, was the Republican nominee. For many ballots the four Greenbackers voted for Jason H.

                    give Turpie the necessary majority of one. The three Greenbackers elected on the Republican ticket
                    had voted, strangely enough, for Harrison sooner than the Democratic Greenbacker voted for

            <p>True, the Democrats again became the inflation party when the issue was revived in the silver
                    agitation of the 1890's. Voorhees remained in the Senate until 1897, and Turpie stayed in
                    the Senate until 1899, and both fought shoulder to shoulder with the forces of free silver. Voorhees
                    remained a strong advocate of fiat money, and on August 22, 1893, while speaking on the repeal of
                    the purchasing clause of the Sherman Law he put his philosophy of money in the following succinct
                    paragraph: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Money is the creature and congress its creator. Gold and its alleged intrinsic value goes for
                            naught as a circulating medium unless the coin bears the stamp of the
                            government—a stamp more powerful than the grasp of the lion's paw or the
                            eagle's claw in bestowing life and activity on a dead and otherwise useless
                            material. The same official stamp on silver, or on paper, at once ennobles them to an
                            equality with gold in purchasing power, no matter how debased, how degraded, or how
                            valueless the silver or the paper may have become as commodities by sinister and unwise

                    a church. They would gather at the home of some farmer and there conduct a service at which a sermon
                    and a prayer would be read by the leader of the group. A number of the early German churches in the
                    West had their origin in this fashion. It was not unusual for a pious individual to persuade his
                    friends in the neighborhood to assist him in organizing a religious group. Religious communities of
                    this nature in various stages of development frequently came to the attention of the itinerant
                    minister. His appearance in such communities would be greeted with joy and every attempt would be
                    made to have him settle in their community.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>Before the first church was built, services were held ill private homes, barns, schoolrooms,
                    courthouses, public halls, or even carpenter shops. In many rural communities several congregations
                    used the same buildings interchangeably. Sometimes while they were building their own church, the
                    congregation would use the church of another denomination. The more religious-minded of the Germans
                    objected to the use of strange churches and especially of barns and courthouses for sacramental
                    services and made every effort to hasten the building of their own church. If a member presented

            <p>The churches which began to appear in the fifties and sixties were somewhat more pretentious than the
                    log structures. Inscriptions were placed on the wall behind and over the pulpit such as
                    "Come unto me all ye that labor and arc heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
                    The placing of the altar and the pulpit opposite the entrance was also typically German. The
                    acquisition of an organ came first in importance and then the installation of a bell, which
                    definitely distinguished the German churches from the American meetinghouse. Nothing stirred the
                    German heart more than the sound of bells which pealed forth from the little rural churches located
                    on the hills.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>An idea of the nature and extent of the pastor's duties may be learned from the carefully
                    recorded minutes of the congregation of the German Evangelical Lutheran and Reformed Church at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Huntingburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> of January 1, 1844. He was directed to preach in a loud and clear voice in the spirit
                    of Jesus, to administer the Holy sacraments, to be diligent and true in prayer life and the study of
                    the Scriptures, to visit the sick and comfort the bereaved, to make pastoral calls, to visit the
                    school and conduct examinations and see that everything was in order and performed according to the
                    word of God, to have confirmation instruction, to be responsible for law and order in the church,
                    and if he could not conduct the services, he was to provide a capable substitute. These minutes also
                    indicated how the minister was to be elected. After several candidates had preached trial sermons,
                    and the congregation had had an opportunity to discuss their respective merits, an election by
                    ballot was to be held in a congregational meeting. The candidate who received a majority vote,
                    provided he was a member of the Evangelical Association of the West, was invited to serve the
                    congregation. From the minutes of this congregation, it is also apparent that the duties of the
                    janitor were also carefully outlined,<hi rend="sup">16</hi> which is another indication of the
                    German's trait for detail and passion for thoroughness.</p>

                    Catechism. In the late seventies, a pastor introduced another catechism to which the members
                    objected, and in the congregational meeting of January 12, 1879, made an issue of this matter. In
                    church government many of the German Protestant churches on the frontier vested control in the

            <p>For several years affairs in Ferdinand among the Catholics had not been operating very smoothly, but
                    in 1849 the disturbances had reached a stage where a large part of the community felt steps should
                    be taken to curb them. A committee of five was appointed to draw up resolutions expressing the
                    sentiments of the people. The disorders, however, could not be controlled mid on Palm Sunday, April
                    1, the following letter from the bishop was read by Father Kundek:<quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It is with sincere regret and deep affliction of heart, that I find myself compelled to leave
                            the congregation of Ferdinand without a Pastor. I soon expected to visit you and to rejoice
                            in the increase of Catholicity in that portion of my Diocese; but it was in vain that I
                            indulged in such consoling hopes. They have at once been blasted, not by the fault of many,
                            I trust; but still, sufficient is the evil, to prevent me from sending among you a Priest,
                            as long as one can not reside there without danger for his life or Character, dearer to him
                            than life itself. I have therefore directed Rev. Joseph Kundek to remove the Vestments and
                            sacred vessels from the Church wherein the holy sacrifice will not be offered until peace
                            will be fully restored and charity reign among you.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

                    congregation were deeply grieved and immediately took steps to settle the difficulties. A special
                    committee was appointed and on Easter Monday reported that in their estimation the most satisfactory
                    way of meeting the situation would be for the congregation to pledge itself under oath to terminate
                    all social and business relations with the troublemakers. This resolution with signatures was
                    delivered to the bishop at <placeName>

            <p>At other times the lives of several of the priests were threatened, but it is apparent that they were
                    courageous and faced the situation squarely. An interview with a man of authority on May 2, 1944,
                    indicated that even today sonic of the members of the congregation at Ferdinand resent a priest who
                    is not of German ancestry. It must be remembered that in Ferdinand there were northern and southern

                    <p>On the 2d day of December, 1860, there was a letter found before the door of Rev. Isidore, in

                        40 or 50 men to take his life if he did not leave. I would ask you, 40 or 50 cowards! do you

                    years later a man threatened to shoot Father Chrysostom. The pastor met the threat in the pulpit by
                    throwing his hand to his broad chest and saying, "Here, shoot!" The troublemaker
                    lived in the HessenEck<hi rend="sup">22</hi> and had publicly declared his intentions of shooting
                    the Father iE he entered this section. The pastor announced that at a designated hour of a certain
                    day, he would walk along the road through the woods of that region, and if anyone wanted to shoot
                    him, he might hide behind a tree and carry out his threat. Father Chrysostom returned home unharmed.
                    A woman with a questionable reputation came to the rectory one day and since no one met her at the
                    open door, she entered and boldly climbed the stairs which lied to the private rooms. Father
                    Chrysostom heard her footsteps and met her at the top of the stairs. With the assistance of the
                    Father's foot, she descended the stairs at a greater rate of speed than she had ascended.
                    On another occasion a man of small stature took it upon himself in a very insolent manner to inform
                    Father Chrysostom how to manage the affairs of the church. The Father merely took his visitor by the
                    coat collar, lifted him from the ground, carried the dangling man across the yard, and after a few
                    words of good advice, deposited him on the other side of the fence.</p>
            <p>A story related by a travelling salesman indicates that Father Eberhard, who served the parish at
                    Ferdinand from 1871 to 1898, had patriarchal authority. When the salesman drove through the town, he
                    came upon the scene of a rough fight at the main intersection. The fight became more serious, and he
                    thought A sheriff should be summoned, when a spectator. yelled out, "Fetch the
                    pastor!" After a short interval he heard a voice say, "The pastor is
                    coming!" Everybody looked up the hill toward the church and there saw a black-robed figure
                    approaching with a firm step. When he arrived he said, "What's going on here

            <p>Father Kundek wished to honor the early settlers who had borne with him the trials and tribulations
                    in connection with the founding of the town of Ferdinand and the building of the churches and,
                    therefore, had their names, of which there were 174, inscribed in a book as Free Citizens of the
                    Congregation of Ferdinand, 1848. It is probable that this was done when the new church was put in
                    use. Those who wished to enjoy the right of citizenship in the congregation after this event were
                    required to pay a fee of three dollars. The custom of paying this fee in order to be affiliated with
                    the parish continued until 1906. One could belong to the parish without being a Free Citizen, but
                    then he was denied the special privileges which others enjoyed. The document setting forth the
                    rights of citizenship consisted of eleven articles of which a few are listed.</p>

                    Father Kundek made a sick call and had the Blessed Sacrament with him, he would take a little hand
                    bell along. Whenever he passed a farm or people at work in the fields, he would ring the bell and

                    organized a Hundred Guards which added pomp and color not only to church celebrations, but also to

            <p>On one of the Rogation days the parish still goes in a procession to the chapel on Mount Calvary. The
                    most picturesque procession, however, was on the feast of Corpus Christi. Days before the
                    celebration the boys and girls made wreaths and garlands for the church and for the four altars
                    which were erected throughout the town. The men built triumphal arches, and every house along the
                    route was decorated with holy pictures and statutes. In each quarter of the town there was an altar
                    in a shrine constructed of wood and adorned with muslin. A procession of approximately one thousand
                    started at the church and followed the glittering canopy underneath which the priest carried the
                    Blessed Sacrament. Most of the people marched in groups representing the society to which they
                    belonged and displayed the banner and regalia of their particular society. The band and the choir
                    alternated in the psalms and hymns. The church bells also made their contribution. Another

            <p>No doubt, the holiday which is more important than any other in the German home is Christmas. For
                    weeks before Christmas the hearts of the little tots beat with hope or fear since they have heard
                    that the Christ child will reward the good and correct the bad. The German <hi rend="i">Hausfrau</hi> has been kept busy baking many varieties of cookies such as Lebkuchen,
                    Pfeffernüsse, and Springerle. In the German home Christmas Eve is the great family
                    festival. Without the Christmas tree the festival would have little meaning for the Germans. In
                    making the preparations for the celebration the happiness of the children is considered, and they
                    are the principals for that evening. There is no time in the entire year which brings more joy to
                    the heart of a German child than the Happy Evening. The joy of that evening has made such an
                    impression on the German mind from childhood up that poets have given vent to their feelings in
                    beautiful verses referring to the happiness experienced on Christmas Eve.</p>

            <p>Another unusual custom occurred in connection with weddings. A brother or friend of the bride
                    extended the invitation to the wedding. He carried a staff as a badge of honor and symbol of
                    authority, and on his horse he would ride from house to house as he had been instructed. When he
                    delivered the invitations, the invited party would acknowledge the acceptance of the invitation by
                    tying a silk ribbon a yard long to the staff. Since each invited guest chose his favorite color of
                    ribbon, by the time the staff was returned to the prospective bride, it bore all the colors of the
                    rainbow. If the invited guest had no ribbon, money was given to the bearer of the invitation to
                    purchase a ribbon at the village store.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>

                    of from eighteen to twenty-four pupils and then hire a teacher for a term of sixty days with a
                    remuneration of one dollar and a half to two dollars per pupil. The men who lived in that particular
                    district built these schools of logs near a spring so the pupils might have access to water. At one
                    end of the structure was a large fireplace, and at the other end a shelf which served as a writing
                    desk. The seats in the schoolroom were made by splitting small trees into halves and supporting them
                    by four or six wooden pins. A window was made by cutting a log out of one side of the building.

                    have a different book, they would recite one at a time and in order of arrival at school on that
                    particular day Apparently, it did not matter what book they had so long as they had a book. The
                    sessions of the school were comparatively long since they lasted from sunup to sundown. There was no
                    regular hour for opening the school, but when a pupil arrived, he was expected to take his seat and
                    begin the study of his lessons. There must have been considerable confusion since the pupils had the
                    privilege of studying out loud in whatever tone of voice pleased them most, while at the same time,
                    the teacher was making an attempt to explain multiplication or long division to another group. Many
                    people were of the opinion that the more noise the pupils made in studying their lessons, the better
                    qualified they would be to recite. Goose quills served as pens, and the ink used was made by boiling
                    red oak bark and sumac berries and then adding a little copperas. Since them were no blotters, sand
                    was used.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

                    stipulated the subjects to be taught and also indicated that if the parents of a certain area wished
                    the introduction of the German language as a branch of learning, their request should be granted
                    provided, that there were at least twenty-five children in the school, and the request was made

            <p>The German immigrants brought with them from the Old World the ideal of parochial schools, in which
                    children of local congregations were instructed in the elementary branches of general (education,
                    and provision was also made for their religious instruction. Because there was a shortage of
                    teachers, the pastors became the first schoolteachers of the parochial schools.</p>

                    when the school was organized, but it was discontinued in 1881. The pastor was responsible for
                    teaching in the parochial school until 1865. The school term began with the first of September and
                    ended on Easter. Children of school age were expected to attend the parochial school, and even
                    though they did not go, their parents were expected to pay the assessed fee. The fee for the first
                    and second child was two dollars each and if there was a third child, no fee needed to be paid for
                    the latter. Six years later the fee was changed to fifty cents a month for each child of members and
                    seventy-five cents per month for each child of non-members. By 1870 those who lived in town were
                    expected to pay six dollars and those living on the farm four dollars for each child for the term.
                    It may be assumed from these minutes that the assessment had to be increased in order to pay the
                    salary of the teacher since after 1863, the pastor no longer taught the school, but a teacher was
                    hired for that duty. Some teachers apparently, had introduced new books on their own initiative. It
                    was, therefore, carefully recorded in the minutes that in the future no teacher had the authority to
                    change the textbook or introduce new books since that was a matter to be left to the discretion of
                    the Church Council.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>

            <p>The German Catholics at Ferdinand felt that the school term of the county school was too short and,
                    therefore, made provision to hold school for another three or four months, and each parent was
                    expected to contribute fifty cents at first and later sixty-two and a half cents a month for each
                    child in school. Since the money obtained in this fashion was not sufficient to pay a living salary
                    to the teacher, he also was given the position of sacristan. In the latter position some of his
                    duties were to attend the priest in church, sing, ring the bell, and clean the church. The
                    remuneration for this work was fifty cents from each citizen. It is apparent that not all citizens
                    paid their obligations since in 1849, the trustees stipulated in the contract that they would not be
                    responsible for the payment of the citizen's school money or the sacristan's
                    salary. The curriculum and educational <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The methods employed by some teachers give one an idea of the temper they possessed. A little girl
                    whose name was Anna, not yet six years of age, had to accompany her brother to school because he had
                    been whipped so much that he lost all interest in schoolwork. Anna was given a copybook and required
                    to write with ink in this book. She had the misfortune of getting an ink blot on her book, and the
                    teacher deemed it necessary to punish her. She was made to stand on a high stump into which notches
                    had been cut to make it possible for the girls to climb it. On this stump she had to stand and with
                    an outstretched arm hold the book up for the benefit of the entire school. In another district
                    school girls and boys were disciplined by being made to kneel on the edge of a piece of stove wood.

                    the hand of a child until the skin began to burst open. A rough Swiss teacher seemed to be of the
                    opinion that the proper way to begin the day was to slap or whip the first boy he could lay his hand
                    upon. A man now living in Ferdinand claims that his defective hearing may be attributed to a slap
                    this teacher gave him upon his ear. After the teacher was satisfied that he had established his
                    authority, he began in a very reverent way, "in the name of the Father.

                    became an incorporated town, the township trustees sold the school to the Ferdinand School
                    Corporation for one dollar. Two buildings are used for school purposes. The smaller one is located
                    on the northwest corner of the church block and is situated on the lots donated by the church, and
                    the larger building near the church belongs to the parish. For the use of the latter the School
                    Board of Ferdinand pays approximately three hundred dollars a year. This sum includes the rental fee
                    and fuel and light. The parish building contains four large well-equipped classrooms. Spacious
                    playgrounds also surround the parish building. The town corporation employs the teachers which for
                    the school year 1943–1944 consisted of four sisters and two lay teachers.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>

                    instruction in music, painting, and drawing. The age of the pupils was to range from ten to eighteen
                    years. The hill to success for the projected institution was too steep to climb, for the Catholics
                    were indifferent toward the project, and the non-Catholics mistrusted and opposed the venture. The
                    boarding school, therefore, developed into an ordinary grade school under the jurisdiction of the
                    county. The contract which Mother Theodore submitted to Father Kundek on July 28, 1844, for the
                    management of this school stipulated that the church pay the Sisters one hundred dollars a year.

                    To them the religious instruction was as important as instruction in the elementary branches of

            <p>Out of the speaking past the voice of the undergraduate has never failed to be heard. The American
                    college and the frontier developed together, and, with them, American politics, the mainspring of
                    rhetoric in days when politics were taken more seriously than they are today. Although American
                    undergraduates have not unseated ministries, they have always been articulate and energetic. The
                    force of this statement may be shown by a reading of the minute books and records of college
                    literary and debating societies from the moment of their founding. While the sometimes turbulent
                    realism of their meetings, the sharp give and take, the comedy and pathos of youthful eloquence let
                    loose upon a given theme is now lost to us, those minutes indicate what the student was thinking and

                    that is known of the early literary societies in that institution. They bore names that recalled the
                    dominant classical influence of that period, stately and a bit pompous-Euphronean, Atlantian
                    Literati, Calliopean, Lyceum, Philomathean, Columbian Institute, and, only slightly less
                    magnificent, The Western Literary Society. Some of them flourished for a few years, undergoing
                    successive avatars of reorganization or merging with other groups. None of them exist any longer.
                    Most of the minutes are set down in a faultless calligraphy rare in our days. Each society had its
                    appropriate Latin motto: Lyceum Society drew upon Horace, Epistles II, 2, 45, "inter silvas
                    academi quaerere verum"; Calliopean Society preferred "libri cibus
                    animo." The library indeed of Columbian Institute (for each society had its own collection
                    of books, housed in its own hall) included in 1844 Gil Blas, Don Quixote, Shakespeare, Josephus, <hi rend="i">The History of Redemption, Practical Piety, The Young Man's Guide, Master Key
                        to Popery</hi>, and Bulwer's novels.</p>
            <p>Rules and regulations were rigid. Fines were levied on members for lack of performance, absence,
                    walking about, while a speaker held the Eloor, whispering, talking, leaning <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-042-2-072"/> against the wall, putting one's feet on the stove, using
                    tobacco, or eating apples. Occasionally refreshments of lemonade were served; now and then the
                    ladies were invited. Those delinquent in dues were often exposed to a scene such as this which
                    occurred on March 29, 1844, in Euphronean Hall: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            and animated song in the melancholy chorus of which "Hark from the tombs a doleful
                            sound" all the members enthusiastically joined. Then the society, after listening
                            to a solo on the drum, proceeded to elect officers.</p>

            <p>Sometimes unruly spirits broke the bonds of strict decorum and shocked the assembled gathering, as on
                    July 17, 1844, when retribution fell upon a certain William Hamilton Lazarus Noble: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Mr. Montgomery offered the following motion, Whereas William Noble has at a meeting of this

                            Noble in the commencement of that meeting said that he knew nothing of the question then
                            before the society and did not intend to vote and whereas, contrary to this declaration, the

                            insulted the members of this society but violated one of its laws, to wit "That no
                            gentleman shall use improper language in this Society"; therefore in view of these
                            considerations, I move that William Hamilton Lazarus Noble be expelled from this society,
                            which was adopted.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>After such an ill-omened beginning, the meeting then fell to the discussion of such themes as these,
                    strangely familiar to our machine age: "Should the Classics be discarded in our Academies
                    and schools? Are professional men too numerous in our country?" or
                    this one, still hotly debated by our major political parties: "Would it be good policy for
                    posterity to be held responsible for the debts of their ancestors for a longer time than one
                    age?" In the same year the speakers mulled over the proposition, "Ought
                    there to be a Congress of Nations?"</p>
            <p>On off-days, when interest in current affairs lagged or when the objectivity that history bestows
                    upon events long since enacted seemed more desirable than partisan contemporary issues, the members
                    discussed lofty problems of this sort: "Does the Poet exert a greater influence than the
                    orator? Is our national character advancing in intelligence and
                    virtue?" "DO savage nations possess a complete right to the
                    soil? Was the execution of Mary Queen of Scots <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-042-2-073"/>
                    justifiable?" This was a favorite topic; the tragic queen sometimes gave way to
                    other figures, Louis XVIII, Charles I, or Robert Emmett; but the question was framed In the same
                    terms.</p>
            <p>Other questions gave rise to much ethical soul-searching and painful logic. What, after all, could a
                    student debater in a tolerant and liberty-loving nation in the year 1844 say about the embarrassing
                    questions: "Ought Congress to take any means to prevent the spread of
                    Catholicism? Was it morally right for the American colonies to revolt from Great
                    Britain? Does civilization increase happiness?" Who could
                    successfully defend the affirmative on "Has War been beneficial to the world?
                    Should a student in college cultivate the friendship of the ladies?" Consciences
                    were intermittently troubled by the proposition, occurring as early as October 15, 1859:
                    "Was the Mexican War of 1816 justifiable on the part of the U.S.?" And
                    while the backbreaking toil of the pioneer farmer was a part of every student's experience,
                    they could still gravely discuss a question that acutely troubles us today: Are labor-saving
                    machines beneficial?"</p>
            <p>But it was the national issues of the time that stirred the debaters to surpass themselves; year by
                    year, certain questions reflected the intense drama of history. The Euphronean Society in 1844 was
                    disturbed by the challenge: "Should <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> be admitted to the Union?" and in 1848 the Lyceum Literary Society
                    considered: "Would it be right to establish slavery in any territory that has lately been
                    annexed or may be in the future? Should Congress support the Wilmot
                    Proviso?" and anxiously inquired on May 25, 1849, "Will the discovery
                    of the gold mines in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> be more beneficial than injurious to this country?"</p>
            <p>Throwing to the winds the jejune topics "Does the reading of novels injure the
                    mind? Docs the persecution of the sciences tend to retard their
                    progress?" these tireless interrogators of the Delphic oracle turned on April 9,
                    1844, to grim realities with the query: "Is it probable that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> will sustain her liberties?" and as tile Civil War drew near, they
                    asked in breathless succession: "Is the refusal of Northern States to obey the Fugitive
                    Slave Law sufficient cause for a Southern Secession? Is Secession treason?
                    Ought the Fugitive Slave Law to hale been passed?"</p>
            <p>Sober spirits attempted in vain to quiet fevered minds. With the nation plunged into conflict, Mr.
                    Finch, of Lyceum Society, offered the following on September 13, 1861:</p>
            <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-042-2-074"/>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>"Resolved that in the debates of the present term owing to the excited state of public
                        feeling we abstain entirely from questions in which governmental policy on the war is
                        concerned." It was taken up for immediate action and after a prodigious display of both
                        eloquence and logic was lost. The society then proceeded to select a question to be debated next
                        night and finally adopted the following.: Can we reasonably expect to suppress the present
                        rebellion?</p>
                </quote>
            <p>The questions and resolutions came swiftly, this momentary threat to free speech having been thus
                    averted, interest ran high. "Resolved that our National war vessel was justified in taking
                    forcible possession of Mason and Slidell; Resolved that it would have been expedient for our
                    government to have adopted Gen. <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s proclamation. Is the President's Emancipation expedient and good
                    policy?" One may notice the emphasis upon expedience in these propositions.
                    Objective ethical considerations were, by this time. secondary if not irrelevant. They were reserved
                    for less troubled times, together with such mild academic puzzlers as "Did the Grecian
                    games have a beneficial influence upon the Greek mind?"</p>
            <p>As the war drew to its close, an ugly temper of vengeance gained expression among debaters now
                    thinking of many of their comrades who lay dead on the battlefield or languished in Southern
                    prisons. In 1865 proposals of this nature: "Should the government of the U.S. execute all
                    Rebels above the rank of Brigadier General? Should General Sherman be relieved of his
                    command? Should the returning rebels be represented in Congress? Should the
                    conspirators against the life of our late President be tried by a civil court?"
                    were the order of the day.</p>
            <p>In the cycle of the seasons the speechmakers returned once more to the quiet garden of the
                    age? and to less inspiring problems; in a mood of lofty resignation they were content to
                    reconsider the well-worn theme: "Is woman the moving power in all the affairs of
                    life?" The response which even this might still elicit can be measured by the
                    tribute offered in the notes of one enthusiastic secretary: "One thought while drinking in
                    the flames as they issued from the ardent eyes of the Grecian muse that he was e'en
                    transported to that golden age when heaven-descended heroes extirpated all the woes of man and were
                    chronicled by the muse in strains of surpassing eloquence and beauty." But in the twenty
                    most continuously exciting years since the Revolution these devotees of the muses had bravely
                    shouldered their country's burdens upon the creaking rostrum of the debating hall.</p>

            <p>The Cherokee Commission was the most important commission in the federal management and disposition

                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName> Territory. From May, 1890, to the dissolution of the commission on November 7, 3893,
                    that body made eleven agreements with Indians for dissolution of reservations in the Territory, all
                    of which agreements were approved by Congress and incorporated in the <hi rend="i">

                        </placeName> Statutes at Large</hi>. The agreements involved more than fifteen million acres and
                    were all negotiated on the part of the <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName>. Going behind the political scenes, we find that seven other men, all Republicans, were
                    appointed to serve on the commission, two others were asked to serve, and several hopeful applicants
                    of both political parties were not appointed.</p>
            <p>Section fourteen of the Indian appropriation act of March 2, 1889, provided for the appointment of
                    the Cherokee Commission to negotiate with the Cherokee and with other Indians owning or claiming
                    lands lying west of the ninety-sixth degree of longitude in the Indian territory for the cession to
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> of all their titles, claim, or interest of every kind or character in and to said
                    lands. For this purpose the President was "authorized to appoint three commissioners, not
                    more than two of whom shall be members of the same political party."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    In other words, the commission should consist of two Republicans and one Democrat. For the first
                    time in eight years the Republicans controlled both branches of Congress.</p>
            <p>Strangely enough, Alfred M. Wilson, Democratic member of the commission, was the only person to serve
                    throughout the entire life of that body. It appears that the most potent factor in his securing the
                    appointment was the following letter which Representative Samuel W. Peel of <placeName>

                    Noble wrote to him on May 7: "The Commission will be ready to proceed by the first of June,
                    at the farthest; their. duties will occupy them off and on, for the summer, at least, and may
                    continue longer. … The appointment is deemed one rather of honor and trust, than for
                    emolument." Goodloe. immediately telegraphed his declination. On May 12 he wrote that his
                    "long absence from home on the National Committee during the campaign, disarranged my
                    business so, that it is imperative I should nol again leave for so long a time." Goodloe
                    might well have accepted the appointment and retired to the quiet West, for in November he and a

            <p>During November and December the commission made an unsuccessful effort to purchase from the Cherokee
                    the six million acre tract of land known as the "Cherokee Outlet." Rentals paid by
                    the Cherokee Strip Live Stock Association for the lands amounted to two hundred thousand dollars a
                    year, and a cattle syndicate valued them at eighteen million dollars or three dollars an acre. The
                    commission offered only $1.25 an acre and would not reveal their secret instructions as
                    to how much more they could offer. As weeks went by, Fairchild's patience wore thin. He
                    became provoked ("Mad is no name for it."), yet the "d—d
                    whelps, rascals and boodles" who controlled affairs in the Cherokee Nation exhibited no
                    enthusiasm to sell the lands for $1.25 an acre.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

                    "on account of the continued illness of a member of lily family." This resignation

            <p>The Cherokee Commission is a suitable subject for a case study of political appointments in the
                    administration of Harrison the Second. To know well the history of applications and appointments
                    concerning this commission, is to be familiar with the trend of affairs in passing out the
                    patronage. According to the appointment files, no person who made direct application for membership
                    on the commission secured it. Governors and senators, recently out of office, were on the favored
                    list. Senators and representatives in office were on the alert to secure recognition for their
                    leading supporters at home. President Harrison and Secretary Noble tended to "work down
                    from the top" until they secured two Republicans who would accept and retain membership in
                    the commission. Archival records, however faithfully kept and accurately used, do not reveal all the
                    process and price that brought the beck and nod; but the light is sufficiently clear to discern the
                    movement, even some of the motives, in appointing persons to offices of trust and profit.</p>

                    rugged, heavily wooded, with small streams and springs. He erected a small cabin, later putting up a
                    brick or stone house, started an orchard, raised sheep and cattle, and cleared enough land for his
                    crops. His wife tended the garden, spun the flax or wool for their clothing, tended the bees, made
                    cheese and soap, and gathered the wild herbs and roots for medicine. These settlers were a. sturdy,
                    thrifty, industrious, and God-fearing people. One of their first tasks was to build a church, their
                    "kirk." Three Culbertson brothers, each gave an acre of land, which is still used
                    for the church and graveyard. The church is now in <placeName>

                                    thankful. Last summer I received three letters from friends in <placeName>
                                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                                    </placeName> people of whom I had no knowledge whatever for the correspondence my
                                    father &amp; his people in <placeName>
                                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                                    </placeName> was broken off hefore my remembrance &amp; I never saw but one
                                    letter that came from them one of the above mentioned letters was from a John
                                    Bishop, from one of my uncles whose name was John Bishop of Foulsshilds, and from
                                    the information he gives me I think he is my 2d cousin he says his father &amp;
                                    grandfather were both of the same name with himself that his grandfather died thirty
                                    years ago &amp; his father about three years ago. I presume this is the same
                                    with your correspondence. another of these letters was from a William Hunter who
                                    says he is a full cousin of my own &amp; he gives me a full account of my
                                    grandfathers descendants, he dates his letter from Raw Camps Hinknewton near
                                    Edinburgh, the third of said letters was from a William Bishop of West Calder and
                                    appears to be a very distant relation. I have written two letters to them but have
                                    not yet received any returns from them. when you write home to your correspondent
                                    you had better let them know what information you have got and especially where I
                                    live for their letters came with a wrong direction and it was not until they were
                                    advertised in a newspaper that I heard of either them or you. I think from what I
                                    can learn the people of <placeName>
                                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                                    </placeName> and [illegible] errors respecting America, the first is they appear to
                                    me to be in a great measure ignorant of the geography of this country they do not
                                    consider the vast distance people may be from one another here. had your
                                    correspondent known that you and mc are eight or nine hundred miles apart he would
                                    hardly employed you to find me out. The William Bishop, West Calder, who has written
                                    me has a brother caled Peter Bishop, living in Upper Cannada, and he had been
                                    writting to him to call upon me, not considering that him and me are not less than
                                    three or four hundred miles from each other. The second error whitch I think they
                                    are labouring under is that because land is plenty here they think the people must
                                    all be wealthy. this is a great mistake. If you should ever have another occasion to
                                    write to me direct to John Bishop, Argyle, washington Co. <placeName>

                                    You might bring a good number of sacks they would do well &amp; some moleskin
                                    trousers som trinkets and toe pieces for shoes. Dont bring any guns nor watches nor

                                    &amp; most depraved wretches you ever was amongst. if you go by orleans you will
                                    shun that evil. there is yet another good article to bring that I have not mentioned

                                    would be very acceptable but I doubt it would be a harder task for you them all the
                                    other articles which I have mentioned. I wish to be remembered to your brother

                                    Miss Prentace that I have forgot altogether about that half promise. If you should
                                    be troubled with sea sickness get a broad belt &amp; put it around your body
                                    about the lower part of your stomack &amp; lace it very tight perhaps it give
                                    you some relief. I think that is all now.</p>

                                    Advertisement appeared both in the Herald of Friday, and of today—I sent
                                    for a copy of the newspaper, but they were all sold, so I have written down a
                                    correct Copy of the Advertisement, which you will read on the other side of this
                                    letter</p>
                        <p>I might have called on William Morrison here, but I did not see what I could enquire
                                    about, as you only can know what luggage YOU mean to take with you</p>
                        <p>If you mean to go with this ship, you have little time to lose.</p>

                        <p>In case I should be out of town on Monday first—I called at Wm. Morrisons
                                    office today—when a young man (I suppose a Clerk) told me that it is
                                    fixed—that the ship <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                                    </placeName> will be dispatched on Saturday the 22d instant—so that you
                                    would require to be in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Glasgow</settlement>
                                    </placeName> on Friday afternoon to get matters arranged here—and you
                                    should send a cart with your luggage on Friday night to be in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Glasgow</settlement>
                                    </placeName> about 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning, and you could then take
                                    it down to the Broomelaw &amp; get the things put right yourselves—to
                                    be ready to leave the Broomelaw at 6 o'clock—you would require
                                    to go at the same time, or else you may be too late</p>
                        <p>Or Another plan,—in case you should be detained, you might be more safe to
                                    be here and have your luggage here on Friday forenoon, and set off for Greenock with
                                    the whole, in the afternoon—-you could easily manage this by send off the
                                    cart of Thursday night &amp; set off yourselves also on Friday morning, so as to
                                    be in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Glasgow</settlement>
                                    </placeName> rather before the cart comes—I think this last plan is the
                                    safest—you had better be in Greenock on Friday night than perhaps be too
                                    late on Saturday</p>
                        <p>If the luggage &amp; yourselves are here on Friday anytime before <pb n="197" id="VAA4025-042-2-095"/> 12 o'clock you have plenty of time to go to
                                    Greenock in the afternoon—</p>
                        <p>If you were going to have much luggage, you could take the cart to Greenock by the
                                    toll road—but if you have only some chests &amp; boxes &amp;
                                    things of that kind, you will easily get them into the same boat with yourselves.</p>

            <p>Although these two books are different, they have one thing in common. They arc histories of business
                    corporations, not biographies of individuals or histories of significant movements. As corporations
                    hate come to play increasingly important roles in the life of the nation and in the lives of the
                    people, it is quite appropriate that historical accounts should be written about them.</p>
            <p>The history of Eli Lilly and Company, a very successful and well-known Indiana manufacturer. of
                    pharmaceuticals, is a narrative of seventy years. It seems to be a brief but accurate record of its
                    remarkable growth from a very small enterprise to a large millionaire corporation. It is well
                    written and excellently illustrated, but there are portions of the story that need lengthier and
                    more detailed treatment. The development of insulin, in which Lilly has played such a notable part,
                    and the more recent production of penicillin may be mentioned in this connection. The entire work is
                    characterized by a modesty, which is a wholesome relief from the more usual promotional attitude of
                    the business world, but which in this instance actually minimizes a significant story. An account of
                    two or three limes the length of this little book would be welcomed. On. reason for the excellence
                    of the work was the enlistment of professional historical assistance. A less desirable feature is
                    the rather. obvious slanting of the work towards the personnel of the corporation, with respect to
                    the morale of the large number of new employees which recent expansion has necessitated. Oddly
                    enough, the excellent labor record of the company, and its insurance and retirement plans are almost
                    neglected in the narrative.</p>
            <p>The second little volume is a narrative of the manufacture of bullets by the Chrysler Corporation in
                    its <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, plant during the last World War. It is a story of the conversion of an
                    automobile assembly plant to the production of a very different article in which it had no
                    experience. <pb n="200" id="VAA4025-042-2-098"/> The change was made under pressure of war demands.
                    After the need for bullets decreased, the plant was used to recondition tanks and trucks and
                    manufacture firebombs, but this is not included in this narrative. This volume is also excellently
                    illustrated.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Lake Erie</hi> completes the American Lake Series as far as the Great Lakes are
                    involved. Those who are interested in the great inland seas of North America may well take pride in
                    the fact that their history has been done in a way which should be acceptable both to the historian
                    and to the general reader. These five volumes will for many years be both the basic outline and the
                    point of departure of the history of the Lakes and their environs.</p>
            <p>Lake Erie was the last of the Lakes to be discovered by the French; it was destined to be the first
                    to become the center of a commercial-industrial empire. Its story is here told in broad panorama
                    with the fine perspective and accurate close ups made possible by sound knowledge of historical
                    background and intimate acquaintance with its life of today.</p>
            <p>Early chapters introduce the lake, its discovery, early settlements and history. High lights in this
                    section are the accounts of Perry's ships and victory, and the empire of Colonel Talbot,
                    hermit-lord of the North Shore. Sloops, brigs, schooners, steamers, and the problems of navigation
                    fill a half dozen chapters. Part II sketches mid-century cities, relates the story of the
                    Confederate conspiracy of Johnson's Island, solves the ore-unloading problem with
                    Dart's buckets, and tells of wine and fish. The industrial age appears with the wedding of
                    coal and iron. Follow the ironmen, big shippers and modern ships for ore, and the development of
                    great cities with their polyglot populations, smoke, refuse, and culture.</p>
            <p>Different readers will favor different chapters and scenes. The reviewer particularly enjoyed the
                    trip "Aboard a Lake Freighter" and the descriptions of the less familial. smaller
                    settlements and peoples; of islands with traditions, <pb n="201" id="VAA4025-042-2-099"/> of Jack
                    Miner's Bird Sanctuary, of vineyards and "characters." The reader may
                    think he is familiar in general with the scene but he will be surprised at how much that is
                    interesting is new; at how much remains to be seen and thought about. Mr. Hatcher has done well,
                    both by his subject and his readers.</p>
            <p>The literature of travel and description has been voluminous in our history; it will continue to be
                    so. It is just as well perhaps, considering ships, roads and facilities, that ten million
                    Mid-Americans do not read the five volumes on the Great Lakes by authors Landon, Nute, Quaife,
                    Pound, and Hatcher, aided and abetted by the Bobbs-Merrill Company. Were they to do so, however,
                    they would have a better understanding, a more developed appreciation, a greater capacity for
                    enjoyment, of an important segment of the epic that has been and is America.</p>

            <p>A historical narrative and an evaluation of the policy of Indian Removal are embodied in this volume.
                    It is written by a recognized authority who has worked for more than forty years with the Indians
                    and their history. It is limited to northern Indians and is a companion volume to the
                    author's Indian Removal: <hi rend="i">The Emigration, of the Five Civilized Tribes</hi>,
                    which describes the elimination of the Indians from the South.</p>
            <p>This volume is of interest to persons concerned with the history of Indiana and the Middle West for
                    it traces the origin of the plan to remove the Indians to the west of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> River, the emigration of the Indians from the Middle West, and the experiences of these
                    tribes in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName> area. The author devotes special chapters to the Potawatomi and the Miami, which are of
                    particular interest to Indiana.</p>
            <p>The story of the negotiation of the various treaties is briefly sketched, and the gathering of the
                    Indians for the journey and the migration from the land of their fathers is narrated for a tribe or
                    a portion of a tribe, one after <pb n="202" id="VAA4025-042-2-100"/> another. The treaty was
                    generally not complimentary to the government or its agents, but occasionally a glimpse of the more
                    sordid relationship between traders and the tribe is given. The author in reality only hints at this
                    phase of the subject but he does indicate that very bad conditions existed in the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> Valley in Indiana. The narrative of the journey from the former home to the new region
                    in the West becomes monotonous after two or three have been read. The migration of the band of
                    Potawatomi which was described in <hi rend="i">The Trail of Death</hi> was only worse than the
                    others in the degree to which sickness and death characterized the journey.</p>
            <p>The second part of the book describes the experience of the Indians after their removal. They were
                    not permitted to remain in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, but were required to move again to the Indian Territory which became the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>. All the debilitating effects of a forced removal were repeated and the progress
                    towards the white man's civilization was too frequently sacrificed in order that the
                    Indians might be placed on less desirable land.</p>
            <p>The entire volume tells of the greed, the inhumanity, and the aggressiveness, not of the Indians, but
                    of the whites, a record which IS a serious blot upon our national honor. There was cheating,
                    horse-stealing, whiskey-selling and de. bauchery, even land stealing. In contrast, it tells of the
                    suffering and patience of the Indians, of their adoption of agricultural life, and of improvements
                    in their. homes when they could keep away from intoxicating liquor. Rather generally, liquor became
                    the curse of the Indian. Although Helen Hunt Jackson is not mentioned, one is reminded of the title
                    of her volume, <hi rend="i">A Century of Dishonor</hi>.</p>
            <p>The volume seems to open a field for. further investigation rather than to exhaust it. More detailed
                    studies of individual tribes, of particular negotiations, migrations, and of the experiences in the
                    new home seem in order. An extensive amount of historical material is revealed in the footnotes and
                    bibliography. Although the format of the book gives evidence that it was published in war time, it
                    is a valuable addition to the historical literature of the Middle West.</p>

            <p>The name of Seargent S. Prentiss looms large in the fourth and fifth decades of the nineteenth
                    century but prior to the writing of this volume no one had attempted to portray his total career.
                    Dr. Dickey's research has been so thorough and exhaustive and his interpretations have been
                    so impartial that it seems unlikely that his task ever will need to be redone. He is just as free
                    and frank in explaining the vices and shortcomings of Prentiss as in interpreting his virtues.</p>
            <p>The short periods which Prentiss served in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> legislature and in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Congress were <pb n="204" id="VAA4025-042-2-102"/> enough to convince him that his
                    interests lay not in office-holding but in the pursuit of his legal career. But he gave unstintingly
                    of his oratorical abilities to the support or others in political campaigns, sometimes greatly to
                    the detriment of his health. His oratorical powers in eulogy and invective were at a premium in time
                    of political campaign. He was always at ease on the platform, be it a formal occasion in a great
                    auditorium or an open-air meeting following a barbecue, easily adapting himself to whatever audience
                    he was addressing. After a Whig barbecue in October, 1848, where oratory prevailed for six hours and
                    Prentiss was the last speaker of the day, the Natchez <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> said of his efforts:
                    "For two hours ht held the audience as by a magic spell … Time, place, and
                    difference of opinion, all seemed to be forgotten" (p. 333).</p>
            <p>Responsibility for the debts of friends whose notes he had endorsed, the hard time in business in the
                    years following 1837, and poor financial investments in property in Vicksburg brought in the
                    1840's financial ruin from which he was never able completely to extricate himself. The
                    greatest tragedy of his life was that his addiction to strong drink shortened his life span.</p>
            <p>When Prentiss went to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> in 1827, following his Yankee rearing in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName>, he expected to spend only a few years in the South before returning to New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. As his professional career began to develop, however, he became convinced that lie had
                    wider opportunities in the South. Although he never became a continuous and vigorous defender of
                    slavery, as early as 1836 he was defending it and declaring in letters to his family in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName> that the chief source of friction on the subject was the fulminations of the
                    "meddling" abolitionists (pp. 77–78). In this connection it should be
                    noted also that he opposed the "fire-eaters" of the South. The idea of dissolution
                    of the Union was abhorrent to him and the preservation of the country undivided became a familiar
                    theme to be found in many of his addresses.</p>
            <p>The author's interest is so bound up in the oratory of his subject that he sometimes stops
                    short of what the general reader's interest may be. For example, in February, 1847,
                    Prentiss gave one of the greatest occasional speeches of his life, his Irish Famine speech. It was
                    delivered in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <pb n="205" id="VAA4025-042-2-103"/> upon the same platform from which Henry Clay had spoken. This
                    was a great oration in its imagery and appeal, its beauty and pathos. The reader is told what <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> but is left to guess whether Prentiss’ speech brought any favorable response
