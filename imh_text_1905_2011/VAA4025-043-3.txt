            Horticultural Humbuggery Among The Western Farmers, 1850–1890

            With the occupation of the western lands, early settlers from the very beginning displayed a marked
                    interest in matters pertaining to horticulture. There is evidence that the quantity of timber, as
                    well as the distribution of it, played a leading role in the selection of new homes in the West.
                    Where there were ample supplies for fuel, buildings, and fences, the land as a rule was not only
                    higher in value, if other things were equal, but it was also the first choice among the frontiersmen
                    and speculators as well.1 So important was timber in the agricultural economy of
                    the West that when new sections were opened for settlement, mad scrambles ensued in order to obtain
                    a track of land nearest a river course or one possessing a grove of trees. As a matter of fact, the
                    initial settlements in the prairie regions were made along the rivers, extending, as for example in 
                        Illinois
                    , like ribbons far into the interior of the State.2 When subsequent
                    settlers were forced to the open country, they would cluster about the isolated groves like bees in
                    a hive. In many cases these islets of trees on the broad prairies served as nuclei for whole
                    communities.
            This timber complex, in connection with settlement, has often been explained by the simple fact that
                    Eastern peoples coming into the West had already been conditioned by a sylvan environment and as a
                    consequence were reluctant to

                     settle on the prairies. This psychological background might
                    have had some influence, but the scarcity of trees and the resulting effects it might have on their
                    economy offers a more plausible interpretation of this reluctance. Early settlers were quick to
                    realize that without timber, they would be compelled to alter their traditional way of life; on the
                    open frontier where a change in the older methods of farming would be a necessity, its ramifications
                    would reach out in a multitude of ways–even to the kind, size and number of houses and
                    barns they could build.3 Moreover, they were well aware that the shortage of
                    timber would affect their social relationships; for example, without fencing materials the people in
                    a community would be unable to enclose adequately their crops or their animals. Under such
                    conditions it would be a constant source of irritation between neighbors.4
                    Furthermore, they would have no sheltering windbreaks to protect them from the prairie gales or from
                    the blistering heat of the summer sun and many associated the prevalence of fevers and the lack of
                    rainfall with the scarcity of trees.5 Finally, and certainly one of the most
                    important factors connected with timber shortage, was the deterring influence it had in keeping new
                    settlers from taking up land in any given community. Older residents realized that the value of
                    their farms would rise or fall depending on the number of people they could attract to their
                        area.6
            
            With these influences at work there developed in the forties and fifties of the past century and
                    extended well into the eighties, an extraordinary enthusiasm for tree culture. In the West it grew
                    to the proportions of a mania including trees suitable for fences and windbreaks, as well as for
                    orchards, shrubs, and vines. In the East this trend was also noticeable though on a smaller scale,
                    for in that section of the country there were still some natural resources that had not been
                    entirely exploited. It is this tremendous demand for nursery stock, especially those connected with

                     varieties which gave rise to the practice of humbuggery. How
                    extensive it was among the farmers and just how much discontent it created would be difficult to
                    determine. It was a "grass-root" type of disturbance, but from the amount of
                    publicity that was given it in the agricultural and horticultural press of the day, one is led to
                    assess it at least as another factor in helping to form the protest type of mind so characteristic
                    of the Western farmer.
            There was extensive swindling in the process of securing and planting horticultural products of the
                    orchard variety. Farmers coming from the East or from Europe, had been reared in an environment
                    where there was plenty of fruit in their diet and upon coming to the prairies of the West they
                    naturally looked forward to the idea of carrying on the practice of cultivating a family orchard.
                    Many of them brought various varieties of seeds with them, and often they had stowed away in their
                    scanty baggage scions of fruit trees, vines, and shrubs capable of propagation.7
                    To secure further supplies of orchard trees, the farmers had three possible sources: (1) they could
                    raise seedlings which as a rule produced an inferior fruit and was generally resorted to only in the
                    initial stages of settlement, (2) they frequently could secure a minimum amount of improved nursery
                    stock from the local nurseries in the East that sold their products through traveling agents or from
                    swindlers who claimed to represent them–the latter being known as bogus tree peddlers
                    because of the stigma attached to them. It was the activities of these peddlers that produced most
                    of the complaints among the Western farmers and fruit growers.8
            
            Much of the humbuggery that centered around tree peddlers could be traced to the slow development of
                    local nurseries. They were usually not only slow in coming into the newer areas, but were naturally
                    small and financially

                     unable to distribute their goods among the settlers.9 What limited stock they were able to grow was generally better adapted to the
                    region, but because they were unable to advertise their products or to send salesmen into the field
                    to sell their wares, they did not command a very large patronage. Nevertheless, the evidence seems
                    to indicate that those who did depend upon the local nurseries not only secured a better and more
                    reliable product, but also found them generally cheaper in price. Most of the business, however, was
                    taken away from the local nurseries by the larger concerns in the East, who sold through their
                    legitimate agents, and by the activities of the bogus tree peddlers.
            The swindling practice of marketing trees by the use of hawkers going about the countryside was only
                    one phase of the economic infractions that prevailed among the Western farmers in a number of ways.
                    This same technique had been prevalent in the East at an early date but moved west with the line of
                    settlement. The farmer was not only victimized by dealers in trees, but he was also duped by patent
                    right agents, quack doctors and veterinarians, pseudo clergymen, lightning rod installers, land
                    speculators, seed distributors, and even tombstone swindlers. In fact, there was open season on
                    these rural people most of the time by a class of Eastern producers and vendors who had been brought
                    up in a much more sophisticated type of urbanism that had not as yet established itself in the West.
                    Agricultural editors were constantly lamenting the fact that most of the farmers lacked even the
                    primary elements of awareness and critical intelligence, being contented to live merely a mundane
                    existence of "idleness, shiftlessness and indolence .…"10 "Too many farmers," says the

                                 Farmer, I, 260.
               
                     The farmer, they think, need not know much .…
                    "" Besides possessing this lack of insight, life on an ordinary prairie homestead
                    was lonely, dull, and monotonous, and when a stranger appeared in the yard, he was more than
                    welcome. Especially was this so when a tree merchant arrived with articles for sale that might help
                    to bring a little cheer and beauty to the solitary farm.
            The Western farmers, through their experiences with these tree missionaries soon discerned that they
                    fell into two distinct classes: (1) there was the legitimate agent who could be relied upon as a
                    genuine representative of some responsible nursery, and (2) the tree peddlers who were neither
                    nurserymen nor their representatives, but merely buyers and sellers and were likened "to a
                    cyclone on account of the wreck they left behind." The problem for the farmer, of course,
                    was to be able to make the differentiation between the two. This second class could be further
                    refined into two separate groups, and they were well described by one of the Western journalists:
                        
                        One is a rough, horny handed man with duck overalls, who only goes out in his own and
                            adjoining counties, seldom or never out of his State .… He is like the flatheaded
                            borer, and does but little harm .… The other kind is the kid-glove tree peddler.
                            He wears a plug hat, high heeled boots all "shined up," with a carpet bag
                            full of fine fruit plates, and large whole fruit made of wax, sealed and preserved in glass
                            jars filled with bitters. This tree peddler is your horticultural dude. He does not work at
                            home. He goes abroad seeking whom he may devour. He wants pastures new and pastures green,
                            for he has no county of his own, no State and probably no nursery. He goes West. He drops
                            down on 
                                Kansas
                            . He represents the "Home Hill" or some other great nursery in
                            the East. His trees are borer proof. They are the Russian variety, or they are grafted on
                            hard wood stock. Your dude tree peddler is a man of gab. His tongue is as long as your arm,
                            as oily as a piece of bacon, and as loose as a calf's tail in fly-time. He pays his
                            attention to your wife and shows his wax fruit to your daughters. He knows he will sell
                            second-class trees that he will get from some neighboring nursery when it comes time to make
                            his delivery.12

                     came to his farm. They left nothing undone that might add to
                    their effectiveness in selling their nursery stock. They drove the best, as well as the fastest
                    horses, with the finest harnesses and carriages. They had the necessary vocabulary to convey the
                    impression that they were scientific and well-trained for their "profession." They
                    were quick to discover the farmers' interests and backgrounds. When they contacted a person who had
                    come from 
                        New York
                    , these ubiquitious peddlers were sure to enlarge upon the qualities of certain kinds of
                    fruit that "Mr. New Yorker grew in his native State .… If the party to be
                    victimized is from some other State, the same dodge is played off by substituting such varieties as
                    grow well in that State."1⋆ They always had, no matter what
                    the variety might be, exactly what the farmer wanted and each new season found them with specially
                    developed plants which they could use as leads. Such a peddler might have in his possession a
                    catalogue or book of plates showing the most highly colored specimens of some reputable nursery such
                    as those in 
                  Rochester, New York
               , a concern familiar to most westerners. He might
                    have the proper credentials, signatures, and seals, together with a sample of the bottled fruit
                    magnified several times beyond the natural size.14 Finally, to secure and cinch
                    the farmer's signature to a large order and to guard against any remon-stances from the
                    female portion of the household, the peddler might frequently throw in gratuitously a flowering vine
                    or rosebush with a "jaw-breaker" of a name.15

                     farmer because of the novelties and the endless number of new
                    varieties that they were always introducing. It was a period when everyone, not merely the farmer,
                    was attracted by something new and out of the ordinary. Naturally, such a craze for the unusual made
                    it easy for the tree peddler to sell large numbers of horticultural humbugs. There were few agencies
                    at that time to enlighten or to protect the innocent farmer from these frauds, for experimental
                    stations were as yet undeveloped, and too many of the newspapers were willing to accept snide
                    advertisements because of the money involved.16 The better journals were
                    constantly promoting protective legislation and the commendable work of the 
                        Orange
                     Judd publications in securing the first agricultural experiment station as well as
                    exposing popular swindles was of inestimable value to the American farmer." Moreover, the
                    activities of the Commissioner of Agriculture in procuring, propagating, and distributing new and
                    valuable seeds and plants among the farmers was a factor in protecting the agricultural
                        interests.18
            
            The purchasing of these bogus novelties gives one the real insight into the innocent
                    farmer's thinking, for only the most unsuspecting type of mind could have been induced to
                    purchase such monstrostities. A good example of these "rare varieties" were those
                    connected with grapes.19 It was a time when most people were interested in grape
                    culture and yet it was also a time when such an interest might put one under suspicion due to the
                    temperance movement which was beginning to frown upon all alcoholic beverages. In this conflict of
                    interests the tree peddler found a lucrative field for exploitation. In order to increase his sales,
                    and yet not interfere with the moral idealism of the people, he came forward with a grape stock that
                    was so "mild" that the wine

                     produced from its fruit was nonintoxicating.20 Under such circumstances winemaking still remained respectable and as a result great
                    quantities of this deceptive variety, as well as others with superior features, were sold. The
                    farmers were swindled with what the peddler called the "winter grape," or one that
                    would produce a fruit which would "keep all winter," and still another that was so
                    superior that it would "prune itself."21
            
            There were likewise many attractive oddities in berry and flower bushes. Most of the peddlers had
                    pictures of a strawberry that grew on bushes or small trees as large as oranges which would
                    naturally appeal to those who had the backbreaking experience of picking them from the regular
                        plants.22 They took orders for a sweet chestnut, an everbearing mulberry, a
                    thornless gooseberry that bore twice a year, and asparagus roots that matured into stalks
                    "as large as a broom handle" in as short a time as three months.23 They displayed pictures of many flowers, shrubs, and bulbs that were heretofore unknown for
                    their excellency and beauty. The one that was the most attracive to the uncritical eye of both rural
                    and urban people alike was what they called the "blue rose." One firm in 
                        New York
                     alone sent out itinerants to every section of the country selling this horticultural
                    humbug at enormous prices.24
            
            It was in the selling of fruit trees that most of the swindling took place, and it was the concensus
                    of opinion of the agricultural press that no other business afforded so many opportunities for
                    cheating the ignorant farmer.25

                     Judd, in an address before the American Association of
                    Nurserymen, stated that in one-third of a century's experience in dealing with agricultural
                    problems he "had heard of more swindling of the meanest kind by tree agents than by any
                    other class, except perhaps the lightning rod operators."26 The best
                    trees were sold by the larger nurseries in the East and the poorest "culls" and
                    "refuse stock" were shipped to the Western states where they found a ready market.
                    This was largely due to the fact that in the East the buyers of nursery stock would buy only the
                    choice trees while in the West, as one nurseryman put it, "worthless sort of trees can be
                    sold at high prices if they are large enough."27 The peddlers soon
                    discovered that all they needed to do to get an order was to secure some large robust trees and the
                    Eastern concerns had plenty of them on hand for among experienced orchardists it was the small tree
                    that was in demand.28
            
            Among the novelties carried by these tree missionaries was a whole category of
                    "borer-proof" trees to be sold at a much higher price than the old stock names and
                    brands. They had pears that were blight-proof, cranberry and cotton trees, sweet Chinese crabs,
                    weeping peaches, and trees that would produce an apple "half sweet and half sour,"
                    to list only a few.29 But the one scheme that was certain to sell any of their
                    trees, even to the most credulous customer, was merely to attach the word Russian to its name. For
                    years the Western fruit growers had been in search of new nursery stock that would withstand the
                    arid and cold climate of the West and most of the Eastern varieties had not proven to be too
                    successful in subzero weather. As a result trees and plants from all parts of the earth had been
                    imported, and especially desired were those from certain sections of Russia where the natural
                    conditions were somewhat comparable to those

                     in the Western states.30 Experiments were
                    carried on extensively at some of the agricultural colleges with these importations and in spite of
                    the differences of opinions among the learned horticulturists, the farmers in general were led to
                    believe that the Russian types were the answer to their problems. This tendency opened the way for
                    the tree peddler to humbug the farmer, for he would simply learn the foreign names of trees and then
                    sell and deliver to his buyers any "hospital stock" that he was able to buy from
                    the nurseries.31 It was a bonanza as long as it lasted.
            Along with the tree peddlers came another type of swindlers who called themselves the tree grafters.
                    It was not difficult for this group to sell their services to the farmers for many of the early
                    settlers looked upon grafted fruit "as a curiosity, and ... an innovation upon the works of
                        nature."32 They usually traveled in groups, placing their
                    advertisements in the local newspapers previous to their arrival. Their approach was somewhat
                    similar to that of the peddler. They displayed the necessary specimens of wax and bottled fruit and
                    "exaggerated colored drawings and bombastic descriptions." A good account of their
                    operations was reported by the horticultural editor of the 
                  
                            Michigan
                         Farmer. He described this innovation upon nature as follows: 
                        They traverse the country, and take orders to do grafting at so much apiece for all that
                            live. When the season of grafting comes, a few workmen come along with a wagon load of
                            scions, containing every variety that could possibly be called for, all procured from the
                            most responsible source; and as a proof of this, a catalogue of some well known nurseryman
                            is exhibited, and, it may be a forged bill or invoice, while the scions were most likely,
                            cut from some of the orchards they had been grafting in. Thousands of orchards have been
                            ruined in this way. We have now one in our possession which the previous owner had had
                            grafted by one of these rogues, and instead of having some three or four select sorts, as he
                            ordered, he

            The third group of swindlers in this category of itinerants was the tree invigorator or restorer and
                    who become in time the precursor of what we call the tree surgeon in our modern society. His
                    function was not only to restore decayed parts of trees but to invigorate them to higher production.
                    They had cures for most of the blights, and repellants for the common borers and other insect pests,
                    as well as injections which they sold in the form of copyrighted and patented recipes or
                    prescriptions. As a rule they masqueraded under the title of "doctor" and much of
                    their nefarious work was carried on through circulars and advertisements.34 This
                    particular group of swindlers found that most of the tree growers were in need of their services for
                    two reasons: (1) the farmer who purchased his fruit trees from the itinerant peddler almost
                    invariably received an inferior grade of stock to begin with, and (2) the careless manner in which
                    he handled his orchard, after the initial enthusiastic impulse for planting had subsided, created
                    the need for such a craftsman." With these two handicaps against them it was no wonder that
                    most orchards were in continuous need of attention. One horticulturist, in commenting on this topic,
                    stated that 
                        although many trees were lost and worthless from improper treatment in the nursery, ... yet
                            more were lost by unskillful planting, and neglect afterwards, .… In all my
                            observations ... I think I can safely say that I have not seen one orchard … in a

            There was still a fourth type whose business was the construction and maintenance of live fences and
                    who were sometimes called professional hedgers. Their particular skill was in great demand during
                    this period, not only because hedges had become the principle type of fencing on the Western
                    prairies, but also because of the fact that it generally took more time and patience than the
                    ordinary farmer possessed to build and maintain a successful live fence. During the summer months,
                    they grew so luxuriantly that at least two trimmings were necessary to keep them in proper order.
                    Few farmers could afford the time during this busy period, and, as a consequence, poor hedges were
                    the rule rather than the exception.37 Out of this need, there came into the
                    field these professionals who went about the countryside contracting with the farmers to build and
                    maintain their hedges. They generally represented companies from the midwestern states, but
                    according to those who engaged their services, most of them were not reliable.38
            
            The modus operandi used by the hedgers was to contract with the farmer to plant and
                    maintain a hedge for four years at a stipulated sum–usually one dollar and twenty-five
                    cents per rod; the company to secure a percentage of this amount each year after the services were
                        rendered.30 Following the planting, in the spring of the first year, there
                    was little for the hedgers to do but to reset the dead plants and do the trimming until the fourth
                    year came around when it was necessary to perform the most difficult service of them all, namely,
                    the plashing operation. This was a process where the small branches near the ground had to be partly
                    cut, then bent and intertwined in order to close the gaps. It

                     was at this juncture of the contract that the swindle took
                    place. A 
                        Kansas
                     reporter pointed out that in his state these professional hedgers not only
                    "roped the farmers in right and left with their Osage 
                        Orange
                     fence" but after "collecting for three years they left the farmer
                    with an unsightly fence–plashing undone."10 It was in this
                    fourth year that the farmer really needed the expert services of the hedger, but instead, the latter
                    being a swindler and having already made his easy profit without too much work, failed to return.
            Returning to the ways of the fruit-tree peddler, we find that once he had secured his orders the next
                    step would be that of making deliveries. It was in this part of the transaction that most of the
                    chicanery was practiced. His methods of operation have been described in the following manner:
                        
                        An expert at the business will go to a nurseryman and purchase all the trees, good, bad or
                            indifferent, on a certain plat of ground, for which the nurseryman will cut down the price
                            to the very lowest figures, because he is getting rid of everything and having his ground
                            cleared for other stock. So soon as this contract is closed the tree peddler puts himself
                            and his agents into the market to sell what he has thus purchased. They are usually prepared
                            with catalogues and books having not only a description but cuts and plantings, which they
                            insist are correct representations of what they are offering for sale. … Having
                            made their sale of worthless stuff at fabulous prices, … they hurry back to the
                            nursery where they have made their purchases.41
                  
                    
            
            Back at the nursery, which often was not at all the one represented in their catalogues and pictures,
                    they proceeded to make up their orders for delivery.42 During the early years of
                    tree peddling most of the stock was secured

                            without any liability.

                            nurseries were paid large sums just to use their names and catalogues with the privilege of
                            the peddler to purchase his stock where he pleased.

                     from the 
                        Rochester
                     nurseries, there being twenty different nurseries in and around that city. In later
                    years they were apt to contract for part of their stock with nurseries in the Western states.43 This was especially true if the peddler could find nurserymen who would let
                    him practice his frauds in the billing out process. The technique of deception was perpetrated in
                    somewhat the following manner, deviating occasionally in some detail to fit a particular situation.
                    The peddler would come in from the field where he had been selling, with an aggregate of orders
                    sometimes amounting to ten or twenty thousand apple trees of different varieties. The particular
                    nurseryman, being unable to furnish all the various kinds, would allow from his own billing grounds,
                    "large quantities of stock to go out under false names.…."" If
                    a nurseryman were solicitous of his own reputation he might insist on having the proper labels put
                    on the trees, in which case the peddler would conform only to change the tags after they had left
                    the nursery. Or, not infrequently the peddler would buy the trees at a given nursery and then have
                    them removed to another concern where they were "heeled in … with the privilege
                    to label … [them] as they please, or as their cupidity may suggest, .…
                    "" This fraudulent method of mislabeling trees was not only difficult to detect at
                    the time, but it generally took from three to five years before the innocent buyer actually
                    discovered that he had been victimized; by that time the peddler was out of reach and restitution
                    was impossible. Such a

                     Nurseries" and sent to a central point in each community where trees had been
                    sold. Most of them were sent by boat or on open cars because the charges were less and unloaded at
                    the docks and stations where they were left exposed to the weather.47 Notices
                    were mailed to the buyers that their trees would be delivered at such a point and at such a time.
                    The person in charge of delivery would frequently not be the one who had sold the trees, so all the
                    agreements and promises that the buyer had with the sellers were ignored. Some farmers were shrewd
                    enough to see that they had been swindled–in such a case they might attempt to resist
                    payment. But this was not easy, as one victim reported, for the peddler "has made his
                    papers to fit his designs so exactly that you are in a net from which you cannot
                        escape."48 Negotiable notes were taken from the farmers at the time
                    of selling and resold to the party who was to deliver the trees or were "shaved"
                    at the local bank. If the farmer refused to pay for his stock the agent would threaten suit in which
                    case it would involve legal costs and this amount would generally be higher than the actual bill.
                    Furthermore, to prosecute a tree peddler, a farmer would have to prove that the trees delivered were
                    a misrepresentation, and to do that it would take several years under growing conditions, so that
                    with these difficulties confronting them most farmers in the end chose to pay these bills, however
                        unjust.49
            
            The selling of trees in this manner was indeed a lucrative business, resulting in high prices to the
                    buyer and high profits to the seller. The preponderance of evidence attests

                                Rochester

                     to the fact that the peddlers prices were from two to three
                    times higher than those listed by the responsible nurseries. In the case of their novelties the
                    margin was still higher."0 The profits of the nurseryman who sold the
                    bogus trees was usually only about twenty-five per cent, as he was anxious to clear his ground for
                    new planting, while the tree peddler received the balance, and his profits in some cases ran as high
                    as six thousand dollars a season.51
            
            The extent of this practice took in practically all of the Western states but was confined largely to
                    the period from the early fifties to the late eighties, by which time the farmers had either been
                    educated to the ways of the peddler or laws had been enacted regulating the nursery business. In
                    some of the years during this period there was more fraud than in others, depending upon the general
                    economic conditions in the country. Various states were troubled more than others but even those in
                    the Great Plains areas, where trees were difficult to grow, too often heard "the cry of the
                    tree peddler in the spring of the year."52 Certain sections of a state
                    might be affected more than other sections since the peddlers usually traveled in groups of a dozen
                    or so.53
            
            The extent of the fraud in any one section is difficult to determine in spite of the numerous
                    estimates made by those who had been victimized, for such reporters were usually not in a very good
                    frame of mind to make really accurate statements. Perhaps the most accurate accounts were those
                    given by observers in 
                        Wisconsin
                     where, due to so many farmers of foreign extraction, tree peddlers were as numerous as
                    "candidates at a town caucus." J. C. Plumb of Rock County, a prominent and
                    respected nurseryman and fruit leader, made this observation: 
                        For forty years I have had good honest competition from eastern ard southern tree agents
                            .… They have the same right of trade as we, .… But when the business
                            came to the proportions of organized fraud, with tens of thousands of dollars backing, the

            There were several reasons why this form of dishonest business was allowed to continue for so many
                    years before it was brought under control. In the first place nurserymen themselves profited from
                    it. It served as an excellent outlet to get rid of their old stock every year, and furthermore, it
                    did not seem irregular to many of them since they were merely following the example of others in
                    various business activities." In the second place there was a genuine fear on the part of
                    many nurserymen and journalists alike that "if it were not for peddlers there would be
                    fewer orchards." It was true that these itinerant merchants did encourage tree planting,
                    even though they were of inferior stock, for most farmers were gullible enough to buy from them
                    instead of ordering direct from the responsible nurseries. N. J. Col-man, in his address before the
                    American Association of Nurserymen, challenged the members to put their house in order, while at the
                    same time he recognized the benefits in the past of this particular evil. "Tree
                    peddlers" he said, "have done much harm as well as good. They have induced
                    hundreds of thousands to plant trees … [and] are a sort of necessary evil. …
                    It is to regulate the business so as to keep dishonest men under proper restraint. …
                        "56 In the third place some of the responsibility for the
                    continuance of these practices fell deservedly upon the shoulders of the consumers, most of whom
                    were not only ignorant of which varieties were adaptable to their climates but were grossly
                    negligent in tending the trees once they were planted. Often

                     their trees would die after only a season or so and the farmer
                    would then lay the blame upon those who sold them. Furthermore, there were some peddlers who were
                    honest to begin with and who would deliver the regular warranted stock to their buyers, but if any
                    of the trees were slightly crooked or were small in size the farmer would complain and request them
                    to be reduced in price. In such cases, the peddlers soon learned that it was expedient to deliver
                    what they knew would please the customer rather than what they knew to be suitable. Those who
                    refrained from this practice sooner or later had to withdraw from the business in order to remain
                        honest.57
            
            There were numerous proposals made throughout this period to reduce the problem. Many such proposals
                    came from the legitimate trade itself, but the farmers were quite vociferous in expressing their
                    grievances. Hardly 'a state or national nurserymen's convention was held without finding on
                    the program an essay, address, or resolution dealing with the evils of the dishonest tree agents.58 By the late eighties the problem had become so acute that some form of action
                    was imperative. A stigma had become so attached to the nursery business that a marked decrease was
                    noticeable in sales of horticultural products of all kinds. L. R. Bryant, a prominent 
                        Illinois
                     nurseryman, in an address before the American Association, stated that it was necessary
                    to take some action not only as a matter of dollars and cents with the trade, but as a question of
                    moral responsibility. "The reform, if it comes at all," he said, "must
                    come from the association as a whole."53
            
            Reforms by the nurserymen themselves, however, were adopted slowly for there were some in the trade
                    organizations who profited from the dishonest practices and thus were reluctant to make changes. It
                    was not until the business as a whole fell into such low repute as to make it possible at last to
                    secure a majority who were willing to take some action. A few of the important proposals that were

                     the nurserymen were (1) that sound horticultural knowledge be
                    disseminated by them to the buyers so that they would be able to discriminate properly, (2) that
                    every nurseryman adopt a set of copyright trade-marks, credentials, and signatures which could be
                    furnished to their agents in the field, (3) that they make their advertisements and illustrations of
                    fruit correspond to natural specimens, thus eliminating the "picture fruit" which
                    were in most instances gross exaggerations, and (4) that they ask the federal government for
                    legislation permitting them the right to secure letters patent for all new developments in plants in
                    order to prevent tree peddlers from selling them without a license.60
            
            These suggestions were wise ones and if they had been put into effect as law, would have gone far
                    toward eliminating many of the questionable practices, but they were merely treated as voluntary
                    helpful procedures and consequently proved to be ineffective. Stricter measures were necessary and
                    inevitable. In some of the Western states farmers and horticultural societies alike requested
                    regulatory laws from their legislatures.61 By 1886 they had been successful in
                    securing such legislation in 
                        Kansas
                     and 
                        Minnesota
                     while some other states followed at a later date.82 With these
                    enactments, a new day had dawned for the buyers of nursery stock for they outlawed the old practices
                    of swindling the farmers with humbugs by subjecting the bogus-tree peddler to a fine, an
                    imprisonment, or both, and requiring all nursery firms from outside the state to post bonds
                    guaranteeing their horticultural products.
            From the following discussion it is evident that this form of humbuggery in the sale of nursery
                    stock, which was only one phase of the various forms that were perpetrated on the Western farmer
                    during this period, existed for nearly a half century before it was brought under control. It was

                     an outgrowth of the nursery business setup before public means
                    of communication was adequate. Nurseries in the East, and more specifically in 
                        New York
                    , found a lucrative outlet among the innocent farmers for their inferior nursery stock
                    which they unloaded mainly through bogus-tree peddlers. These westerners, as far as horticultural
                    knowledge was concerned, were grossly ignorant as to the suitable varieties best adapted to their
                    climate and soil, and as a result it was possible for itinerant peddlers to sell them almost any
                    kind of stock at fantastic prices. Local nurseries were scarce and those that did establish
                    themselves in the West were not large enough to compete with the Eastern concerns, since its success
                    required traveling agents to sell trees, for most farmers were slow in buying trees on their own
                    initiative from local nurseries but were gullible in the presence of show-off swindlers. Besides
                    bogus trees these swindlers sold many kinds of novelties that were nothing more than humbugs. They
                    further victimized the farmers by selling them a professionalized service in the form of plant and
                    tree grafting, invigorating, and hedging. They also frequently bribed local nurserymen into allowing
                    them the right to use their vacant grounds in order to heel-in or bill-out inferior trees purchased
                    from the Eastern concerns. These frauds had been exposed for years by the agricultural press, but
                    with the development of experimental farms and stations, scientific journals and other public
                    agencies, the information ultimately reached the rural areas. The innocent farmers were slowly being
                    educated to a higher level of thinking until finally they were able, in co-operation with the
                    activities of the state horticultural associations, to secure laws which drastically reformed the
                    methods of buying and selling nursery stock.
         
         
         
            Migration to the Whitewater Valley, 1820–1830
            
                    Chelsea L. Lawlis

            The American frontiersmen found the Whitewater Valley before the Treaty of Greenville freed its
                    eastern portion from Indian control. After the treaty, it was invaded by squatters, some of whom
                    probably became landowners when the federal government put the land on the market in 1801. Among the
                    five or six thousand persons who came to the Valley by 1810, Carolinians, Kentuckians, and
                    Pennsylvanians were most numerous. Quakers were especially prominent in the upper part of the
                        Valley.1
            
            The War of 1812 seems to have checked migration but did not drive out the hardy pioneers who were
                    already there. The war removed the menace of the Indians and the Great Migration resulted in a large
                    increase in population in the entire Valley, the western portion of which had been secured from the
                    Indians by treaty in 1809. By 1820 the total population had grown from five or six thousand to
                    twenty-nine thousand.2
            
            Between the years 1821 and 1827 five boundary changes occurred, and it was not until the latter date
                    that the boundaries were stabilized. They have remained the same to the present time. The first
                    alteration occurred January 5, 1821, when a new county, Union, was formed from the three counties
                    which were already in existence. By the terms of this statute Union County was to be composed of
                    territory from the northeastern part of 
                        Franklin County
                    , the eastern edge of 
                        Fayette County
                     , and a section of southern 
                        Wayne County
                     . 
                        Wayne County
                     also gained some territory from 
                        Fayette County
                     . On December 21, 1822, 
                        Brownsville
                     was named as the county seat of the newly-formed Union County, but in the following
                    year Liberty succeeded 
                        Brownsville

                     ville as the seat of justice.3 The
                    remaining four changes merely revised the boundaries between the counties.4
            
            As a result of numerous Indian cessions, Indiana had been largely freed of the red man, and his claim
                    to land no longer hindered the progress of settlement in the Valley. The 
                        Brookville
                    
                    Enquirer of April 2, 1822, revealed that all of the 
                        Delaware
                     Indians had been removed from the state as far as sixty or seventy miles north of 
                        Indianapolis
                     and the Pottawatami inhabited an area west of the Wabash River
                    near Lake 
                        Michigan
                    . At the head of the White River were the Stockbridge Indians, who
                    were civilized and religious— they would not even shoot deer on Sunday.5
            
            Due to the uncertain state of the currency at this time, land offices found it necessary to exercise
                    great care in receiving bank notes of doubtful value in payment for land. Consequently, the 
                        Brookville
                     land office announced in a local newspaper that it would only accept notes from the
                    following banks in payment for lands, except notes of less than five hundred dollars: Bank of the 
                        United States
                     and its branches; Incorporated Banks of

                        Madison

                     4 A second change took place January 11, 1823, and by this statute 
                                Wayne County
                             lost some territory on her western boundary to 
                                Henry County
                            . An act of January 31, 1824, repealed the law of 1823 and redefined the Henry-
                                Wayne County
                             boundary. A fourth statute became effective January 16, 1826; by its terms 
                                Franklin County
                             lost a section of territory in her north central area to

                             and some land in the northeast corner to Union County. The fifth and final
                            change resulted from a statute of January 26, 1827, which permanently fixed the boundary
                            between Henry and

            Additional land was added to the Whitewater Valley counties as a result of the New Purchase in 1818.
                    This new section served as an outlet for land-hungry settlers, who were not long in buying the land
                    offered for sale. In what later became Fairview Township, 
                        Fayette County
                     , all the New Purchase land was sold between 1820 and 1823. Since the land had been
                    Indian property, there were no roads, and the first settlers had to hack their way through the
                    underbrush to reach their homes. Several New 
                        England
                     families came to 
                        Fayette County
                     between 1819 and 1822, settling chiefly in the New Purchase. In Posey Township,

                        England
                     entered in the years 1821 and 1822. While these new lands were being filled, new
                    settlers were still finding homes in the older areas. John Macamy Wasson stated that between the
                    years 1820 and 1822 there were several newcomers to 
                        Richmond
                    , chiefly from the Eastern states.7

                        Quaker
                     immigration from the South shows a decrease during this period, although the movement
                    was still considerable. In the previous decade there were 141 removal certificates to meetings in
                    the Whitewater Valley, but in this ten-year period (1821-1830) there were only 109, Whitewater

                     Friends had not yet become adjusted to their new surroundings:
            
                    The immigration from slave states to these parts is great; it renders them [the Quakers] however
                        a very mixed company, and it will require time before they can rightly understand one another,
                        and get over their various early prejudices. Their business was conducted harmoniously. There
                        are some here also who have made strong efforts to sow the seed of infidelity, and have
                        succeeded in many cases.9
               
                
            In 1825 Grellet visited the 
                        Core Sound
                     Monthly Meeting in 
                        North Carolina
                     and discovered that there were only twenty families remaining in that meeting. It had
                    formerly been a large meeting but many had moved in a body to 
                        Ohio
                     in 1800 because of the unhealthiness of the district and on account of slavery. Some
                    remained behind because they felt that it was their religious duty to protect the slaves who had
                    formerly belonged to Friends who had now moved away; it was feared that they might be reduced to
                    slavery again.10
            
            The Niles' Weekly Register of November 21, 1829, reported that emigration through
                            
                  Charleston, Virginia
               , was proceeding on a large scale: 
                        The tide of emigration through this place is rapid, and we believe, unprecedented. It is
                            believed that not less than 8,000 individuals, since the 1st September last, have passed
                            this route. They are principally from the lower part of this state and 
                                South Carolina
                            , bound for Indiana, 
                                Illinois
                            , and 
                                Michigan
                            . They jog on, careless of the varying climate, and apparently without regret
                            for the friends and the country they leave behind, seeking forests to fell, and a new
                            country to settle.11
                  
                    
            
            These emigrants were wending their way westward not because of a crowded population, but because
                    negro slavery made white labor dishonorable and kept the laboring white man off the soil. Finding no
                    place in such a system, the men took their families and went west of the mountains. Slavery was an
                    important cause of migration, especially among the Quakers. The northward movement of these people
                    was considerable and was particularly strong when the South began to be more unanimous in its
                    support of slavery. Frederick J. Turner stated that Indiana's chief migration in the

                     formative period came, for the most part, from the poorer
                    classes of 
                        North Carolina
                    . The 
                        North Carolina
                     Quakers migrated chiefly for antislavery convictions.12
            
            One of the outstanding Quakers to migrate during this period was Levi Coffin, a North Carolinian who
                    was to become famous later in the underground railroad. In the summer of 1822 he accompanied his
                    brother-in-law, Benjamin White, when he moved west. Leaving 
                        Guilford County
                    , they took the route across the Blue Ridge at Ward's Gap, in western 
                        Virginia
                    , through East 
                        Tennessee
                     and 
                        Kentucky
                    , to the 
                        Ohio
                     River, at 
                        Cincinnati
                    . This route was the best one for loaded wagons. There were eight in the party, and they
                    carried with them a tent and all equipment necessary for camping out; provisions and cooking
                    utensils were hauled in the wagon. At night they slept near their campfire, leaving a large watchdog
                    to guard the camp. The little group traveled alone until they reached Abingdon, where they met a
                    wagon with a group of Kentuckians, who were returning to their home near Crab Orchard. The fact that
                    the Coffins accompanied them to Crab Orchard would seem to indicate that they followed the
                    Wilderness Road. It is not revealed where the party crossed the 
                        Ohio
                     River, however, Elijah Coffin, who journeyed to the Whitewater Valley in 1818, crossed
                    the river at New 
                        Albany
                    , after having followed either the same or a similar route. In 1826 Levi Coffin made a
                    second trip to Indiana by way of the Kanawha Road, four weeks being required for the journey. The
                    first trip, in 1822, took five weeks.13
            
            Not all the immigrants traveled over the more rugged routes, even at this early date. Aaron White, a 
                        Quaker
                     from 
                        Pasquotank

                        North Carolina
                    , set out from his native state in 1829, hoping to find a more suitable climate for his
                    wife, who was ailing at the time. White stated that

                        stone and the hills taken down. The 130 miles from 
                            Cumberland

                        but as the hills was taken down to a certain degree so as not to have to brake our wheels, we
                        made out very well 15

                        Wheeling
                     required ten or eleven days. From 
                        Wheeling
                     they rode the steamboat "B. 
                        Franklin
                    " down the 
                        Ohio
                     River to 
                        Cincinnati
                    , a distance of four hundred miles. "Floating down the stream at 12^ miles an
                    hour…. We this morning arrived about 7 in 
                        Cincinnati
                    , making 34 hours from 
                        Wheeling
                    , and must acknowledge it one of the most pleasant and commodious passages we ever
                        had."16
            
            From 
                        Cincinnati
                     it required two days to go the sixty-five miles to 
                        Milton
                    , in 
                        Wayne County
                     . He had sent their luggage and equipment by wagon and it arrived in two weeks. White
                    estimated that the total expenses for himself, his wife, and three children amounted to
                    approximately two hundred and fifty dollars."
            Timothy Flint, who traveled in the western country at this time, has written vivid descriptions of
                    travel along the 
                        Ohio
                     River, the chief waterway to the west. He was impressed with the river's
                    beauty and the scenery along its banks, although river travel was often somewhat dangerous and the
                    traveler sometimes found himself at the mercy of the elements. Flint traveled part of the way on a
                    boat owned by a New

                        time.18
            
            Travel conditions within the Whitewater Valley during this decade had not greatly improved yet there
                    were attempts at improvement. Aaron White wrote that the roads were neglected and were especially
                    bad after a spring thaw. One highlight in the history of transportation in the Valley was the
                    locating of the National Road to 
                        Richmond
                     in 1828. The road was to provide an important link between the East and the Whitewater
                    Valley. Local authorities demanded little in the way of specifications for roads in those days. The 
                        Richmond
                    
                    Intelligencer, of June 5, 1822, printed an account of a road
                    commissioner's meeting, the purpose of which was to receive "proposals"
                    for the opening of twenty-six miles of roads in 
                        Wayne County
                     . The roads were to be forty-eight feet wide, clear of timber and brush. The latter
                    specification, however, was modified to a certain extent: "… the trees to be cut
                    even with the ground, except those that are 18 inches in diameter and upwards, which must be cut at
                    12 inches from the ground 19
            
            While it is likely that there was some migration to the Valley from the 
                        United Kingdom
                     during this period, there is no evidence to indicate that it was of much consequence.
                    There were, however, Germans in the Valley at this time. In 
                        Germany
                     a vigorous revival of the spirit of emigration had occurred after the end of the
                    Napoleonic Wars. In 1817 the people had found it necessary to adopt economies which acted to
                    paralyze industry and caused hardships among the lower classes. Parts of 
                        Germany
                     were suffering from over population. It soon became obvious that every year a crop
                    failure occurred the poorer classes would suffer, and the only courses open to them would be to find
                    either new employment or to emigrate. Discontent appeared to be the most active cause of emigration,
                    especially that caused by a sudden deprivation of necessary commodities. It is known that

                     there were Germans in southeastern Union County in 1826.20
            
            This decade witnessed a rapid increase in the number of towns founded in the Whitewater Valley and a
                    steady growth of most of those previously founded. In the previous article it was noted that 
                        Brookville
                     had been selected as a site for the new land office. The town was already prosperous
                    and the addition of the land office provided an extra impetus to business. In 1821, George Ogden,
                    who traveled in the West, visited 
                        Brookville
                     and described it as being "pleasantly and advantageously situated for trade,
                    manufacturing and agriculture." The land, he said, was rich, producing wheat, corn, rye,
                    oats in great abundance, and excellent tobacco— equal to that of 
                        Virginia
                     and 
                        Kentucky
                    . Ogden went on to say that 
                        Brookville
                     had only ten or twelve houses at the close of the War of 1812, but at that time (1821)
                    she boasted 102 buildings, shops, stables, and outhouses, the majority having been built in the last
                    two years.21
            
            In 1826 
                        Brookville
                     contained the following business establishments: six dry goods stores, one drug store,
                    four taverns, two groceries, two tanyards, three blacksmiths, three cabinetmakers, two hatters, one
                    baker, shoemakers, saddlers, carpenters, physicians, and lawyers in abundance; a printing office, a
                    masonic lodge, a post office, and a large merchant mill.22
            
            These rosy hues were not to last, however, and blacker days were ahead for 
                        Brookville
                    . In 1825 the land office was moved to 
                        Indianapolis
                     and from that time until 1833 business in 
                        Brookville
                     was more or less paralyzed. Hundreds of people from the vicinity followed the land
                    office to 
                        Indianapolis
                     and about the same time many prosperous farmers moved to newly organized counties, such
                    as 
                        Fayette
                     and others in central Indiana. The early importance of the town was indicated by the
                    prominent men who left it. Among them were Noah Noble and David Wallace, future governors of
                    Indiana, and many others who went to 
                        Indianapolis

            Union County appeared to lag industrially, but was proving to be an excellent farming region. In 1826
                    it was described as being a small county hut thickly settled (6,000 persons) by
                    "industrious eastern and southern farmers." In the northeast were Quakers, in the
                    southeast were Germans, and in the west a mixture of people. Liberty, which was laid out in 1822 and
                    made the county seat the following year, contained between one hundred fifty and two hundred
                    inhabitants, two stores, two taverns, and mechanics. 
                        Brownsville
                    , organized in 1815, had two hundred persons, two taverns, and mechanics.24
            
            
               
                        Connersville

                        Fayette County
                     , had experienced a rapid growth when it is considered that the western part of the
                    county had not been acquired from the Indians until 1818. In 1826 
                        Connersville
                     had between four hundred and five hundred inhabitants, four public houses, seven
                    stores, one grocery, cabinetmakers, hatters, tailors, shoemakers, bricklayers, plasterers, saddlers
                    and carpenters in abundance, two physicians, four lawyers, a printing office, a masonic lodge, and a
                    post office. In addition, she boasted a gristmill, sawmill, fulling mill, and carding machines. The
                    county had an estimated population of between five and six thousand inhabitants.25

                     at least eight towns were laid out. 
                        Richmond
                    , although not the county seat, was growing rapidly and soon outclassed the county seat (
                        Centerville
                    ) itself. Laid out in 1816, it had 410 persons by 1822. This number had risen to 453 two
                    years later. It boasted a large 
                        Quaker
                     meeting house in which some five thousand persons had attended a meeting in October,
                    1825. By 1826 the population of 
                        Richmond
                     had risen to 648 while that of 
                        Wayne County
                     had jumped to seventeen thousand. 
                        Centerville
                     could claim only two hundred inhabitants. Industries within 
                        Wayne County
                     were numerous and varied: eight merchant mills, twenty-three gristmills, forty
                    sawmills, twelve carding machines, six fulling mills, two oil mills, one woolen factory, one nail
                    factory, and two printing offices.26
            
            The history of religion during this decade deals with an expansion of previously established
                    churches, the introduction of one new sect, and a conflict between two of the leading
                    denominations—the Methodists and Quakers. In 1822 
                        Brookville
                     dedicated its First Methodist Church, the first brick church of this denomination in
                    the Whitewater Valley. Augustus Jocelyn was minister of the church at this time. In the same year
                    the 
                        Connersville
                     Circuit was organized, John Havens being placed in charge. In 
                        Fayette County
                     Methodist congregations were established at 
                        Orange
                     and

                     in 1822 and at Alquina in 1825. Lorenzo Dow, a Methodist minister, came to Liberty, in
                    Union County, to fill a preaching appointment in 1824. The Whitewater Circuit was divided in 1827
                    into two parts; the northern part became known as the 
                        Wayne
                     Circuit, while the southern part retained the name of Whitewater. Further developments
                    of Methodism will be discussed in conjunction with the Quakers in the vicinity of

            It was pointed out in the preceding article that several Presbyterian families from the East had
                    settled in 
                        Franklin County
                     between 1816 and 1825 and had established churches at 
                  Bath, Brookville, Mt. Carmel
               , and 
                        Somerset
                    . The first 
                        Brookville
                     church had about twenty members, but in 1820 or 1821 it was dissolved due to an exodus
                    from the town and dissatisfaction with the minister. 
                        Fairfield
                     had a Presbyterian church in 1822 and a church building in 1825. 
                        Fayette County
                     's first Presbyterian church was organized in Conners-ville in 1824. In the
                    year 1826 the Synod of Indiana was ordained.28
            
            The Baptist denomination, which is reputed to be the earliest one in the Whitewater Valley, organized
                    a Primitive Baptist Church in 
                        Fayette County
                     in 1824. John F. Cady, in The Origin and Development of the Missionary
                        Baptist Church in Indiana, stated that the Whitewater Association group of churches along
                    the 
                        Ohio
                    -Indiana line became stronger for a time but failed to keep abreast with new
                    developments and became a very conservative body. 
                        Fayette County
                     traces its first Christian church back to the twenties—to John P. Thompson,
                    who came from Bracken County, 
                        Kentucky
                    , in 1822. Thompson returned to 
                        Kentucky
                     to learn more about Alexander 
                        Campbell
                    's teachings from some of the latter's followers, and then came back
                    to Indiana to preach them. A Christian church was organized at Fayetteville in 1829 and at 
                        Orange
                     in the same year. A new denomination to appear in the Whitewater Valley in this decade
                    was the United Brethren, a church appearing in Posey Township, 
                        Franklin County
                     in 1830.28
            
            In the northern part of the Valley a heated conflict was going on between the Quakers and Methodists
                    in 
                        Richmond
                    . The Society of Friends was the chief obstacle to the success of the early Methodist
                    ministers in that region. According to one author, the quakers felt that they had a pre-emption

                     right in the vicinity and were determined not to relinquish
                        it.30
            
            In 1822, Russell Bigelow, who was then on the Whitewater Circuit, was determined to organize a class
                    in 
                        Richmond
                    . He discovered that no one would open their house to him, but he was permitted to use a
                    small schoolhouse on the southern edge of town. His class was formed, but the place was soon closed
                    to him, and he had to disband his class. Three years later, in 1825, James Havens, then on the
                    Con-nersville Circuit, which included 
                        Wayne County
                     , organized a class which was destined to be the nucleus of 
                        Richmond
                     Methodism. Generally, the classes met in private houses and were composed of the
                    unpropertied class. No 
                        Quaker
                     ever attended, nor did he permit his family to attend. Fernandez C. Holliday said that
                    in the late twenties the greatest opposition came from Hicksite Friends and infidels.31
            
            At least not all the Quakers opposed the Methodists for the entire decade. Stephen R. Beggs, who was
                    born in 
                        Virginia
                    , and who was sent as a minister to the 
                        Wayne
                     Circuit in 1828, indicated that relations between the two sects had improved. He spoke
                    of a meeting in 1828: "This year I held a protracted meeting in 
                        Richmond
                    , assisted by some of the local preachers. We were very successful. Some of the Quakers
                    joined us, and the children of infidel parents were soundly converted to God."32
            
            During this decade some progress is evident in the field of education. In 1824 a state law was
                    enacted which made a school builder of eaph voter. When a building was to be erected in a district,
                    people were assigned as choppers, hewers, daubers, etc., and a fine of thirty-seven and a half cents
                    a day was charged for those who did not work or pay an equal amount. This has been called the first
                    common school law, although this does not mean that tuition was free.

                     had no housing problem after the exodus from that town; a
                    vacant house was secured, the stray animals driven out, the floors scrubbed, a blackboard and a few
                    benches were installed, and the school was ready for use.33
            
            A further step in the direction of educational progress was taken by the state legislature when it
                    approved an act which established seminaries in certain Indiana counties. Under the provisions of
                    this statute, it was the duty of the county circuit court or the associate judges of the counties to
                    appoint a board of three trustees, who were to be known as county seminary trustees. The trustees
                    were to secure a site for a county seminary, either by purchase or donation. 
                  Wayne, Franklin
               , and 
                        Fayette
                     counties were empowered to establish seminaries. 
                        Wayne County
                     built a seminary in 1828, the 
                        Fayette County
                     seminary began school on July 13, 1829, but the 
                        Brookville
                     seminary was not opened until the beginning of the next decade.34
            
            The filling up of available lands, the rise of towns, and the presence of important political issues
                    created a type of society which was naturally desirous of knowing what was going on in the outside
                    world. Consequently, this decade witnessed the birth and rise of the press in the Whitewater Valley.
                    It is true that these early newspapers left a great deal to be desired, but they provided the reader
                    of th 1820's with about all that he needed including local and foreign news, business
                    advertisements, lands for sale, notices to stray animals, unclaimed mail lists, weekly notices
                    showing what bank notes were sound, and many other important items.
            The origin of many of these papers is obscure. In 
                        Franklin County
                     the commissioner's record of 1815 seems to indicate that a paper existed then.
                    It was probably called the Plain Dealer. Five years later this paper became the 
                        Brookville
                    
                    Enquirer and Indiana Telegraph. About 1824 it changed hands and was probably
                    acquired by Augustus Jocelyn. He issued the

            It is likely that the Indiana Statesman was established in 1824 at 
                        Connersville
                     by Abraham Vanvleit, a native of

                    . The Village Press, first issued in 1824, was another 
                        Fayette County
                     newspaper. Union County's first newspaper was probably printed at 
                        Brownsville
                    . It is known that the Flying Roll and Union Advertiser was issued
                    there in 1825. It was a four-column folio, devoting most of its space to foreign news, and was
                    short-lived. The Liberty Gazette, another Union County paper, was first printed in
                    1827. The 
                        Richmond
                    
                    Weekly Intelligencer was the first newspaper to be issued in 
                        Wayne County
                     . Its date of origin is unknown, but it was printed as early as 1820. It died in 1824,
                    but the Public Ledger, edited by Elijah Lacey, came out this year. It was
                    discontinued in 1828.36
            
            The census of 1830 shows a total population of 45,817 for the four counties, an increase of 16,975
                    since the census of 1820 was taken. This gain was not as large as the one between 1810 and 1820, but
                    this is probably due to the fact that most of the land had already been sold and settlers were now
                    pushing on to the New Purchase. The census figures prove that the Whitewater Valley was, for the
                    most part, still populated by young people. Twenty-one per cent were under five years of age,
                    sixteen per cent were between five and nine, thirteen per cent between ten and fourteen, eleven per
                    cent between fifteen and nineteen, fifteen per cent between twenty and twenty-nine, nine per cent
                    between thirty and thirty-nine, six per cent between forty and forty-nine–a total

            The decade of the twenties witnessed a resumption of migration after the Panic of 1819 had seriously
                    checked the westward movement. The resumption came slowly and migration seems not to have become as
                    extensive as during the Great Migration. The 
                        Quaker
                     influx was less than during the Great Migration, but it was still of considerable
                    proportions. Although persons from other parts of the nation and from abroad came to the Valley, the
                    Southern migration probably remained quite large. During the entire decade of the twenties the
                    growth of population was less than during the shorter period from the close of the War of 1812 to
                    the taking of the census of 1820. Nevertheless, newcomers came in some number, often taking the
                    places left vacant by former residents who moved on to the lands of the New Purchase. New towns were
                    founded, new churches and schools were organized, and roads were improved. Many newspapers were
                    started, but their lives were generally very short. It seems evident, however, that social progress
                    was made, although the attractiveness of other towns and of the newly opened central part of the
                    state enticed many of is former citizens to leave.

            Lying astride the West Fork of White River approximately midway between its
                    headwaters and its mouth, 
                        Morgan County
                     has felt the pulse of the river since the first influx of white settlers shortly after
                    1816. Long before then the Miami and other Indian tribes had used it as a means of transportation
                    and a source of food. Early French fur traders likewise found it the most convenient means of
                    penetrating the dense forests of its region.1 Since the coming of the first
                    settlers, the river and its valley have served as an avenue of trade and transportation, as a
                    fertile agricultural region, and as a place for the building of homes and towns. This has been true
                    not only in Morgan but in Owen, 
                  Greene, Daviess
               , and 
                        Knox
                    , downstream from Morgan, and 
                  Marion,
                            Hamilton, Madison,
                            Delaware
               , and 
                        Randolph
                    , upstream. Especially in the more rugged downstream counties, of which Morgan is the
                    most northern, the river has been a source of both strength and weakness. Its floods have wrought
                    repeated destruction; many will recall the disastrous floods of 1930 and 1913.2
                    Especially high floods also occurred in 1828, 1847, and 1875.3 Yet floods have
                    brought fertile alluvium, which spreading out over the floodplain, remarkably wide and level in many
                    places, has long yielded good crops for White River Valley farmers who have
                    persisted. In Morgan

                     and downstream counties, this floodplain, lying as it does
                    between rough, relatively infertile uplands, has been a land of comparative plenty.
            It is the story of this river that we relate here. Its place in the history of 
                        Morgan County
                     may well reflect a similar role in the development of other river counties in
                    southwestern Indiana.
            There have been three fairly distinct periods in the growth of 
                        Morgan County
                    , and in each of these the river has played a significant part. The first, extending
                    from 1818–1853, was a period of rapid settlement when good land was cheap and plentiful.
                    The White River Valley first served as one of the primary routes of entrance
                    into the county, and shortly afterwards agricultural products moved down the river to markets at 
                        New Orleans
                    .
            The second period was ushered in with the coming of the first railroads in 1853 and was logically
                    terminated by an initial population decline shortly after 1910.4 Most of the
                    good land had been taken by the time of the Civil War, and by 1900 much of the best timber had been
                    cut. Other economic endeavors such as the clay products plants at 
                        Martinsville
                     and 
                        Brooklyn
                    , the furniture factories, and the commercial use of mineral waters at 
                        Martinsville
                     maintained a population increase until World War I started an exodus to the army and to
                    larger industrial areas. Many never returned because of relatively greater opportunities elsewhere.
                    It was the valley rather than the river itself during this second period which offered a
                    comparatively easy route for a railroad from 
                        Indianapolis
                     to 
                        Vincennes
                    . A map of Indiana railroads and rivers reveals how strikingly near to the river the
                    railroad clings through rough hill lands which commence in central 
                        Morgan County
                     north of 
                        Martinsville
                    .
            The period since World War I has been one of decline in population, although the "back to
                    the farm" movement stimulated by the depression of the 1930's brought numerous
                    families back to 
                        Morgan County
                    , some to abandoned farms.5 Just as the period between the Civil War
                    and World War I was the age of railroads so has post World War I in Morgan

                     County seen the coming of the improved highway, with the
                    automobile and freight truck. Again the river seemed almost irresistible, for engineers laid their
                    roadbeds on the level valley floor most of the way from 
                        Indianapolis
                     to 
                        Vincennes
                    .
            So it is that the river has repeatedly made itself felt. Further glimpses into the relationship of
                    the river to the people of its hinterland illustrates why many who live within its reach find it
                    both friend and enemy. Let us examine these historical relationships more closely.
            In two important respects the White River influenced the flow of settlers into 
                        Morgan County
                    . First, it was the easiest accessible route from the already populated portions of
                    southwestern Indiana into the wilderness of "The New Purchase." Many who had
                    settled earlier in 
                  Knox, Pike
               . 
                        Daviess
                    , Gibson, 
                        Greene
                    , and other downstream counties made their way along the valley into Morgan.6
            
            Almost equally influential in the early advance of pioneers into the County was Whetzel's
                    Trace named after Jacob Whetzel who in 1818 had led a party of men through the forests from the
                    Whitewater County of southeastern Indiana. It was Whetzel's intention to open up an
                    established route of communication between the Whitewater Valley and the settlements to the west.
                    The most feasible plan was to clear a path through what are now Rush, 
                        Shelby
                    , Johnson, and Morgan counties to the White River, which would then
                    offer a relatively easy approach to 
                        Vincennes
                     and other settlements on the 
                        Wabash
                    .7 Whetzel decided to terminate his "trace" at a
                    site since known as The Bluffs, previously named by the French, Port Royal, a point of contact in
                    their fur trade with the Indians.8 This site consists of prominent bluffs rising

                     8The Bluffs vicinity was considered by the commissioners appointed to
                            select a site for the State Capital as a logical location for the Capital. At that time
                            (1820) some location near the geographic center of the State on the banks of the White Kiver
                            was viewed as the ideal location. 
                                Morgan County
                             was favorably situated, since it was more accessible to steamboats coming from 
                                New Orleans
                             and other southern points than the present site of 
                                Indianapolis
                            . Furthermore, Morgan was more centrally situated than 
                                Marion County
                             in relation to the population of Indiana in the early 1820's.

                                Morgan County

                     half miles northeast of Waverly. These offer a view both
                    upstream and downstream and were a logical western terminal of the trace.9
            
            Upon entering 
                        Morgan County
                     the early settlers located in what appeared to be suitable places. As nearness to a
                    stream was important in the wilderness, the first settlements were made along the White
                        River and on the larger creeks. The streams were also important as a source of power
                    for local flour and gristmills. Good springs were much prized by the early farmers not only for the
                    water, but as a crude "ice box" in hot weather. The "lay of the
                    land" and the presence of any small unforested spots were likewise influential in locating
                    farms. Topography was particularly important because slightly rolling land was more suitable to
                    early farming conditions than was flat land. Consequently, it was not the land immediately along the
                    river that was first settled and tilled, but rather the second bottom land.10
            
            As the early settlers usually came in groups, small clusters of farmsteads developed which encouraged
                    the establishment of small villages as trading centers. The first of these were all relatively near
                    to the White River, generally near the mouth of one of its tributaries. The two
                    earliest settlements were made in 1819. One was located on Lamb's Creek in the southern
                    part of Jefferson Township; the other in Green Township along what is now Stott's Creek.
                    James Stott and six others, coming up from Lawrence County, located farms in this vicinity. Another
                    early settlement was on 
                        Butler
                     Creek about one mile north of White River in Ray Township near the
                    present village of Whitaker. None of these three early communities developed into towns, but they
                    served as important early centers of settlement.11
            
            The settlements that grew into the two most important populated places, 
                        Martinsville
                     and 
                        Mooresville
                     were favored in their growth by conditions not entirely geographic.

                     owes much of its early growth and subsequent development to its
                    choice as county seat. Two sites were under consideration, the present one and one in 
                        Clay
                     Township just north of the river where Centerton is now situated. The Centerton site is
                    nearer the center of the County and is otherwise favorably located. The longer established residents
                    near the 
                        Martinsville
                     site, however, were apparently more free in offering some of their land; consequently 
                        Martinsville
                     (named after the oldest member of the board of commissioners) was established as the
                    county seat in 1822.12
            
            
               
                        Mooresville
                     is much indebted to the man in whose honor it was named, Samuel Moore. This ambitious
                    trader and merchant realized the advantages of having a trading center near the confluence of the
                    main branch and the East Fork of White Lick Creek, a tributary of the White
                    River, and then navigable by flatboat for much of the year. The immediate vicinity of 
                        Mooresville
                     was also good for early farms.
            The townships along the White River were settled first and had a more rapid
                    growth in the early decades than the non-river townships. What have since become the townships of 
                        Washington
                     (with 
                        Martinsville
                    ), 
                  Clay, Madison
               , and 
                        Brown
                     (with 
                        Mooresville
                    ), were first settled in 1820. Harrison, Green, and Jefferson were settled a year
                    earlier, Ray a year later. All, except 
                        Brown
                    , border the White River. Four townships farther from the river, 
                        Monroe
                    , Adams, Baker (near the river but more isolated because of rugged terrain), and Gregg,
                    were settled between 1822–1825, while Jackson Township because of its distance from the
                        White River or any stream big enough to serve as a suitable highway was the
                    last to be settled. The settlement of Adams was also much delayed by distance from a navigable
                    stream and poor local drainage.
            By 1830 the county had a well-scattered population, but with more people concentrated in the river
                    valley, the White River became the principal artery of trade. The golden era of
                    the flatboat was at hand. Its rise and decline on the 
                        Ohio
                     admirably described by T. W. Records13 offers a corollary to its
                    place on the White River as a mode of getting farm products to market from
                    1830–1853, especially during

                        Ohio
                    , never really encroached upon the flatboat trade moving down the White
                    River.
            Noah Major, a pioneer of 
                        Morgan County
                    , writing in his memoirs about 1900 graphically describes the trade as follows: 
            
                    
                  White River, though crooked and turbulent and abounding in snags, drifts,
                        and abrupt cut-offs, was destined to be the great thoroughfare for Morgan county produce, and to
                        convey on its restless bosom many thousands of dollars' worth of pork, corn, wheat, flour, mess
                        beef, and lumber on their way to the Southern markets–generally to the city of 
                            New Orleans
                        , a city then of 150,000 inhabitants and one of the best markets in the 
                            United States
                        . The distance from 
                            Martinsville
                         to 
                            New Orleans
                         is computed at 1,800 miles by water.
                    The rivers are all crooked, and none more so than White River. A trip to the
                        Crescent City and return was usually made in about six weeks, though there were one or two trips
                        made in less than four weeks. These short trips were made by running day and night after
                        reaching the 
                            Ohio
                         river. There were instances where the cables were never tied between the mouth of
                        the 
                            Wabash
                         and the landing at the City. At other times the winds were so high that the boats
                        were drifted ashore and tied up for a day or two at a time. At the time of year (March and
                        April) when the boats were on their voyage, they often encountered thunderstorms and fearful
                        winds, which made it rather uncomfortable for a nervous boatman. Boats and crews were known to
                        be sent to the bottom together by such warring of the elements, though the number was small
                        considering the apparent danger, and none were lost in this manner from our county.
                    It was soon learned that lard, bacon, and bulk pork, were the most profitable products to ship
                        from Morgan county. Although considerable quantities of corn, wheat, flour, and lumber were
                        shipped in an early day, not much of it was done toward the last. The reason is obvious enough,
                        when a thousand pounds, of the pork products would bring $50 in 
                            New Orleans
                        , while the same weight in corn would in no case bring more than $8 or
                        $10. Morgan county was always, practically, the head of navigation on White
                            River, and more so after the building of the feeder dam at Waverly.
                    True it was, in 1824, a little stern-wheel steamboat, firing with fence rails and driftwood,
                        penetrated the wilderness by the meandering of the river as far as 
                            Indianapolis
                        , but she had to "crawfish" back as far as main White river before
                        she could "about face." This settled the question of steamboat navigation, and
                        left it all one way with the "flats," and that was down stream. Thus we could
                        export by the "flats," but we had to import by wagons over the dirt roads from
                        the 
                            Ohio
                         river. From 1840 to 1863 was the golden era of flat-boats. During that period
                        Morgan county stood third in the State for the production of; corn and hogs. Farming was then
                        pre-eminently the business of this county. No succeeding epoch ever proved more satisfactory to
                        our enterprising farmers than this one.
                    
                    The magnitude of flatboating will be better understood by the following estimates which, I think,
                        are within the bounds of reason. Counting an average of fifteen boats per annum from 1829 to
                        1853, we have a total of 345 for the twenty-three years.
                    There were not less than 4,500,000 feet of lumber used in constructing these boats, three-fourths
                        of which were of the finest poplar trees that grew near White river. This lumber was worth at
                        least $10 per thousand feet, or $45,000; 345 boats at a cost of
                        $240 per boat, $82,800. The cargoes, estimated at $4,000 each,
                            $1,380,000.14
                    
                
            From these accounts it is apparent that the flatboat trade was significant in stimulating the growth
                    of 
                        Martinsville
                     and to a lesser degree, 
                        Mooresville
                    . Similarly, it was indispensable to the farmer for they were much in need of a market
                    for their surplus pork and grain in order that they could acquire needed supplies of salt, tools,
                    and other articles not produced locally.
            Ranking in importance with the flatboat trade were the early mills for the grinding of grain. These
                    were generally located on the creeks emptying into the White River, for water
                    was the primary source of power. Small though these early mills were, they were of utmost importance
                    to the early farmer. The sawmills too were important in furnishing the necessary lumber for the
                    building of houses to take the place of the original log cabins.15
            
            Canals affected 
                        Morgan County
                     only indirectly. The projected Central Canal, which was not completed, was to follow
                    the White River through the county and connect with the 
                        Wabash
                     and 
                        Erie
                     Canal near the southwest corner of 
                        Owen County
                    .16 At most this canal would only have prolonged for a short while
                    the flatboat trade with 
                        New Orleans
                    .
            Then came the railroads. Most important in the county's railroad history has been the 
                        Indianapolis
                     and 
                        Vincennes
                     road, commonly known as the I. and V. One of three railroads in the county, it was
                    originally started by the New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                     Company before the Civil War. It was, however, not opened until 1869, by which time it
                    was controlled by

                        Pennsylvania
                     Railroad, the present owners.17 Until about 1930 this road was a
                    most important transportation facility-affording much local freight and passenger service. Towns and
                    villages along it thrived as centers of local trade and industry. But with the coming of the
                    automobile and freight truck, the railroad traffic has dwindled, and now this railway is mainly a
                    significant connection between 
                        Indianapolis
                     and the coal mines of southwestern Indiana.
            With the coming of the railroads, the river became only a minor transportation route. 
                        New Orleans
                     became a distant city by flatboat. 
                        Cincinnati
                     for a short while figured in the county's trade largely because the first
                    railroad to enter 
                        Morgan County
                     was from the southeast with 
                        Cincinnati
                     as its ultimate southern terminus. With 
                        Indianapolis
                    , however, rapidly growing as the commercial and political center of Indiana, this was
                    an unnatural orientation and hence the dominant trade and transportation routes soon turned
                    northeastward. Then the river valley became important as a transportation route northeastward. The
                    trade flow had been reversed, but the White River Valley in 
                        Morgan County
                     remained the gateway between 
                        Indianapolis
                     and the downstream counties.
            The presence of rough terrain on both sides of the White River in western 
                        Morgan County
                    , and the considerable wideness of the valley there, plus the fact that it is subject to
                    frequent flooding have combined to make a definite transportation funnel through Ray Township. In
                    locating the railroad, engineers tried to keep away from the rough terrain on the one hand and the
                    treacherous flood plain on the other. This restriction has made for a concentration of traffic flow
                    and has somewhat isolated the northwest and southeast parts of the county.
            The railroad age brought changes in the settlement pattern of 
                        Morgan County
                     in several of which the river figured prominently. Rural communities, villages, and
                    towns adjusted to its "pull." Approximately 40 per cent of the total population of 
                        Morgan County
                     is within the White River Valley which makes up only 10 per cent
                    of the total area. 
                        Martinsville
                    , which had been the center of the pork and grain trade during the days of the flatboat,
                    took the lead in manufacturing

                     and commerce when the railroad became the principal link with 
                        Indianapolis
                    . The smaller towns of Paragon, Center-ton, Whitaker, 
                        Brown
                    's Crossing, also served as trading centers. The trading pattern definitely
                    centered upon the valley because it was the easiest and most direct route for outgoing farm
                    commodities and incoming manufactured goods.
            The early rural settlement in the valley was concentrated in the second bottoms. These bottoms were
                    better drained and thus more suitable than were the more fertile but less well-drained first
                    bottoms. Consequently, the first farmsteads were grouped on the outer fringe of the valley,
                    frequently along a tributary stream. By the Civil War, the more suitable second bottoms had become
                    well filled, and farmers approached the river. These first bottoms were used as sites for new
                    farmsteads as well as for additional cropland. In western 
                        Morgan County
                     where the valley is widest, this encroachment upon the river is evident from traces of
                    former home sites. Before the removal of much of the forest cover from central Indiana watersheds
                    the flood hazard was less than at present and homes were more safely built in the lower bottoms.
            The flood of 1913 halted settlement of the floodplain nearest the river. Deserted houses and barns,
                    fruit and shade trees, and traces of chinaware mark the sites of former homes near the river. Now
                    few homes remain between the river and the railroad, which follows approximately the margin of the
                    1913 flood.18 The coming of the improved highway (now State Road 67) stimulated
                    this retreat, which was culminated in 1940 when a new highway was completed in the flood-free part
                    of the valley north of the railroad.
            With the advent of the automobile and the improved highway the river lost much of its former great
                    influence but by no means all. Two of Indiana's leading highways follow the valley through
                    a portion of the county. It offers part of the most feasible route for a highway to 
                        Bloomington
                     (State Road 37) and also for one to 
                        Vincennes
                     (State Road 67). Along it passes an average daily flow of traffic well exceeding two
                    thousand vehicles on State Road 67 alone.
            Since World War I, there has been less reliance upon

                     the small town. The little village of Whitaker which once
                    boasted a sawmill, post office, freight depot, and two stores has now only the sawmill and one
                    store. No longer is the post office a meeting place of the community. Likewise other valley towns
                    and villages are dying. The sites of 
                        Brown
                    's Crossing, Elk, The Bluffs, and Exchange are recognizable only to those
                    familiar with the valley's past. Paragon, Centerton, and Waverly also are shrinking
                    villages situated relatively near the river.
            In summary, the following historical influences are most significant: (1) the river was a primary
                    entrance route for early settlers; (2) most of the early settlements were in the second river
                    bottoms and along major tributary streams; (3) flatboating stimulated agriculture considerably until
                    about 1850; (4) railroads and highways have used the river valley as the most accessible route to
                    southwestern Indiana; (5) following the Civil War, settlement pressed upon the first bottoms only to
                    retreat as floods became more frequent.

                     Culture Club
            
                    Laura M. Long
                    ⋆
                
            Mrs. Mary Ann Long had a feeling for history. She believed that important events should be carefully
                    and truthfully recorded. She was the proud possessor of a family Bible in which important events
                    were so recorded. Lately, however, merely to think of that Bible made her squirm, for she had
                    struggled a long while with a certain entry on one of its pages, and finally, for the first and only
                    time in her life, had corrected a truth by turning it into a fiction.
            According to the dates handed down to her, one of her grandmother Downs'—or was it her
                    grandmother Sparks'?— sisters had married before she was fourteen years old.
                    That, of course, was disgraceful. And when you were trying to raise your own
                    children—Mary Ann had seven—you had to be careful of what they might read,
                    even out of the Bible. So Mary Ann had quietly and secretly changed the date as it was written
                    there, setting the girl's birth back three years. Ordinarily, it would not occur to her to
                    argue with history, but when you had growing girls—and boys, too—and when one
                    stroke of the pen could turn a wanton ancestor into a decent woman, it was plainly her duty to
                    protect her own. She had done it, and she was not sorry.
            But tonight, as she wrote in her diary, she was not trifling with history. She was setting down
                    facts, as truthfully as she saw them. She realized the words she was writing would one day be
                    important to local history.
            "On Tuesday, October 20, 1896, several ladies met at the home of Mrs. David F. Long to talk
                    about organizing a club for mutual improvement. On Monday, October 26th we met at Mrs. Dr.
                    Arwine's to organize. The club to be known and called the C.C.C. or 
                        Columbus
                     Culture Club."
            And beneath this, on the same page in her diary, she wrote: "It's one of the
                    beautiful compensations of life that no man can sincerely try to help another without helping
                    himself. Bailey."
            It has long been considered great fun to laugh at Women's Clubs, but those who laugh, do so
                    through ignorance. Clubs like the Culture Club, composed mostly of housewives 
                  
                     ⋆Mrs. Laura M. Long is a resident of 
                                Columbus

                     who long for something a little better than cooking and
                    cleaning and baby tending, even though they appreciate that these, too, are the good things of life,
                    such women gathered together in each other's homes "for mutual
                    improvement," have tremendously influenced our national thought—whether it be
                    for good or for evil. After studying a full half century of club programs, let me assure the
                    scornful that no one could possibly be a member, of such a club for many years without being
                    "improved" a little. I am beginning to understand why I so often know many of the
                    answers to the numerous quiz programs. I have learned them—no matter what the
                    subject—in the Culture Club.
            Only a handful of those charter members and their immediate successors ever went to college. A few
                    went to music school, a few to boarding school, or for a year at most, to the State University or to
                    DePauw or to Hartsville College. One of them had a medical degree, but that was unusual.
            In those days people—especially fathers, who have to pay the bills—thought
                    "higher education," as they called it, was apt to ruin a woman's brain.
                    It was a handy thing to believe and saved many a father from feeling he was lax in his duty to his
                    daughters. Study clubs, therefore, offered a lower but less dangerous, a cheaper and more accessible
                    education. They also furnished the soil that was later to nourish adult education as we now know it.
            There was no public library in 
                        Columbus
                     when the Culture Club first started. That, in fact, was the first public work they
                    attempted. They began nagging for a Carnegie Library. Mary Ann Long's
                    brother-in-law's name—John Stobo—is cut in stone on the face of the 
                        Columbus
                     Library. And the first librarian, Jennie Elrod, sister of Tom Elrod, whose initials
                    T.S.E. at the bottom of his column, "Hoosier Homespun," are familiar to readers of
                    the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    News, was taken into the club immediately. The 1900 programs, in which Jennie
                    Elrod's name first appears, is also the first program to print a bibliography. The Culture
                    Club was finding that culture cannot be acquired alone.
            In the 1898 programs, they printed a poem in the front of the yearbook which, with their motto,
                    affirms their purpose. The motto is from a poem of Robert Herrick's:
            "Attempt the end, and never stand to doubt; Nothing's so hard but search will find
                    it out."
            
            The poem, which is by Brotherton, attempts to define culture.
            
                    Culture means far more than plowing and seeding; Culture means also tending and weeding, Sifting
                        the dangers, keeping the sweet, Courage both sunshine and tempest to greet.
                    All growth means troublesome toil in the dark, Clinging and climbing straight to
                        the mark; Sifting and sorting and striking deep root, Burgeoning, blossoming,
                        then—bearing fruit.
                
            So they have burgeoned and blossomed and have borne a good deal more fruit than one might realize.
            In those early years, the members had an amazing amount of confidence in their ability to entertain
                    and instruct. Each year's program was planned to include two guest days, one in the spring,
                    one in the fall. The members themselves gave the programs for these guest days, and it was usually
                    an integral part of the year's study. They also had reciprocity meetings with other
                    clubs—especially with the Magazine Club —or with the 
                        Seymour
                     Study Club or the 
                        Franklin
                     Charlotte Emerson Club. The visiting club would meet with the hostess club, with the
                    visitors usually giving the program. It, too, was always a part of the regular study—they
                    didn't seem to go to any extra trouble to prepare a more widely entertaining program.
            For instance, the minutes of February, 1910, record a guest meeting in which the
                    members—in the presence of their guests, remember!—responded to roll call with
                    original valentine verses. The program followed—a vocal solo by Elizabeth Nugent,
                    "Kiss Me, Sweetheart"; Mabel Snider, substituting for her sister, Lucy 
                        Clay
                    , read some famous love poems, and Myrtle Rogers read from the Browning letters. But the
                    real meat of the program was an original love story by Lydia Lambert, entitled, "A Change
                    of Heart," which the minutes record was laid in 
                        Italy
                    . After that, refreshments were served to the guests, "in keeping with St.
                    Valentine's Day and in the club colors," according to the minutes. (Purple hearts,
                    perhaps? Our colors are purple and white.)
            There were times, of course, when they got a little beyond their depth, but that is far better than
                    being afraid of deep water. There is a tragic, yet amusing, letter in the archives, from one of the
                    members who was for many years ill with a serious mental ailment. The members had evidently  realized that she was no longer able to do her work and had
                    allowed names to be suggested to fill her place. But she had not yet resigned. The letter is her
                    resignation, a dignified and quite proper note. And then there is a postscript. "P.S. The
                    new member will probably be elected today, as three names were proposed two weeks ago. I have the
                    material nearly collected for my paper on International Laws and will gladly turn it over to anyone
                    to whom my work is assigned."
            Succeeding program committees tried very hard after that to fit subject matter and writer when
                    arranging their programs.
            An account of a Reciprocity Day was published in the 
                        Franklin
                    
                    Star on April 27, 1914.
            
                    The Charlotte Emerson Club observed Reciprocity Day on Monday afternoon at the home of Mrs. C. A.
                        Overstreet. This was a guest day, and an invitation had been extended to the Culture Club of 
                            Columbus
                         to be present and give the program for the occasion.
                    After a few words of welcome to the ladies from 
                            Columbus
                         and other guests, Mrs. C. H. Drybread, president of Charlotte Emerson Club,
                        introduced Miss Emma Volland, president of the Culture Club, who presided during the rendition
                        of the following program: A paper on the Customs, costumes and Characteristics of the Dutch
                        People, by Mrs. Eugenia Wright; When Swallows Fly, a song, by Mrs. Elizabeth Nugent; Farms and
                        Tulip Culture in Holland was the subject of a talk by Mrs. Anna Newsom. Mrs. Wirt Lowther,
                        accompanied by her daughter, gave an excellent musical recitation called "Aux
                        Italliennes."
                    Each duty was delightful and gave great pleasure to an appreciative audience.
                    The home was profusely decorated with apple blossoms, and sprigs of this flower were given as
                        favors .…
                
            That, of course, was the year the club studied Holland. How the Italians ever got into Holland for
                    that musical recitation I wouldn't know. The First World War was only a! few weeks off. But
                    the generous waste of apple blossoms is sheer Hoosier abundance.
            Mrs. Mary Sigmund, mother of Dr. William Sigmund, records another guest meeting in October, 1905.
                    "After the program was finished, we were at liberty to all talk at once."
            The organization of Women's Clubs all over the country was a phenomenon that swept through
                    the Middle West in the closing years of the nineteenth century. I have my own opinion that it was
                    actually brought about by the invention of  farm machinery, in
                    an indirect sort of way. Farmers bought machines and found less need for their daughter's
                    arms and backs, and because the machinery was expensive, parents were quite willing to allow their
                    daughters to make their own way outside their homes. This sent girls streaming into the towns,
                    wanting domestic work, asking small wages because all they really wanted was to learn the ways of
                    the town and to keep themselves clothed. Their parents were usually able and willing to help them a
                    little, and housework in good homes in town was considered a step upward on the social ladder. The
                    girls often married town boys, and their employers often gave them their weddings—flowers
                    and preacher and all the trimmings—in grateful acknowledgment for faithful service. This
                    abundance of domestic help gave women the first real leisure they had ever known. Clubs were the
                    answer.
            Some, of course, preferred to use their leisure in playing cards—there were morning euchre
                    parties in those days— but cards were more frowned upon then than they are now, and even
                    those who played whist and euchre didn't care to use all their leisure in such idle
                    pursuits. The writers of 
                        Middletown
                     claim that the reason so many literary clubs met on Monday was to prove that the
                    members were economically prosperous and didn't have to do their own laundry. That may be,
                    but I rather think it was just that Monday had a bad reputation as being a "blue
                    day," and was therefore a good day for entertainment. Most of the Culture Club, I imagine,
                    did their own washing in those days, getting up an hour or two earlier on club mornings in order to
                    be through by noon and ready to give their responses when their names were called at the meeting at
                    two o'clock. Anna Newsom has told me that such was her mother's custom, and I
                    doubt very much if she were the only one to pursue such a schedule.
            We had not been organized long before we began to realize that there was strength in union. There is
                    an item in the minutes of April, 1906. "Our president called our attention to the Union
                    meeting May 5th, 1906, and informed us that each member had the privilege of taking a
                    guest." Also in the archives is a letter to Miss Anna McEwen announcing our payment of dues
                    to the Indiana Union of Literary Clubs, whose object, according to its constitutions,
                    "shall be the  consideration, in open convention, of
                    questions pertaining to social, educational or literary matters, and of methods for the best culture
                    and advancement of the state." (Sounds a little like a quiz kids program, doesn't
                    it?) This was a more or less nebulous federation, and we joined it the year following our
                    organization. Later, when the General Federation was formed, in 1907 I believe, we joined that, too,
                    but as time went on, we resigned and joined again, almost at will, our joining apparently merely the
                    result of our loyalty to Miss Vida Newsom who became a national figure in the federation. On more
                    than one occasion, we allowed Miss Newsom to suffer embarrassment before her fellow officers in the
                    federation, because her parent club was once again thinking of resigning. We were never too well
                    sold on the national federation. We were isolationists at heart. None of us ever went to General
                    Federation meetings, except Miss Newsom, although we enjoyed our district and even our state
                    conventions. Often we would belong to the district and state federations even when we no longer
                    belonged to national.
            Belonging to the federation brought upon the club innumerable small pressures we had never felt
                    before. "Please include in your year's work at least one program on social
                    hygiene," for instance. This came before they'd had time to build up any
                    resistance. So it is rather alarming to see, in the old program for 1912, whose subject is 
                        Norway
                     and 
                        Sweden
                    , a talk to be given by Dr. Bertha Clouse on Social Hygiene. One's first
                    impression is that the Culture Club has been reading too much of Ibsen. Gradually they learned how
                    to avoid such interruptions. They learned to reply, "Our constitution does not
                    permit," and "we see no reason to change at present." The original
                    constitution, which was revised only a few years ago, provided for "The thorough
                    investigation of any subject pertaining to Art, History, Literature. ..." It is rather
                    exciting to read through the old records and see how often the club would carefully weigh a question
                    and then make their decision. "We see no reason to change at present." I wish we
                    had a few of those steady-minded-clear-thinking women in Congress at this moment! Not that they were
                    reactionary—rather the opposite—but they didn't allow themselves to
                    be blindly led by would-be leaders.
            Once when Vida Newsom had written us that the General Federation would like us to take action on some
                    question or  other, Lydia Lambert, Vida's own sister,
                    presented the letter to the club. "I want you to do as you please about this," she
                    said. "But remember it is always a satisfaction to be a part of any good
                    movement."
            So the club wrote letters to congressmen asking for the regulation of child
                    labor—Indiana's Senator Albert J. Beveridge had a bill. They asked for better
                    housing and slum clearance through committees headed by Mrs. Albion Bacon. They went on record in
                    favor of woman's suffrage. Hadn't they, years before the question ever came before
                    Congress, had their own debate on this subject? Back there in 1899?
                    "Resolved, that granting of suffrage to women will unsex her."
            Had we not been federated, however, we would not have gained state-wide fame by winning contests. The 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Star became our star, and under its light, we prospered.
            Our 1926–1927 program was a study of Africa. That was the first year the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Star had its contest in which prizes were offered for the best club programs. We
                    entered ours—I was program chairman that year, and Mrs. Alethea Sharp and Mrs. Emma Adams
                    were the other members—with the feeling that we wouldn't lose anything, even if
                    we didn't win. And then the letter came saying we had won first prize, and Elizabeth
                    Haymond, who was president that year, and I went down to have our pictures taken. We got the program
                    committee together, took them to the drug store and over1 a glass of coke
                    whispered our secret. No one else, not even our own members, must know the good news until it was
                    published in the Star.
            
            On October 10, when 
                        Columbus
                     opened their Sunday Star, they saw Elizabeth Haymond and Laura Long
                    staring back at them. The next day the club met. Merle Reeves, the secretary, reported the good news
                    in her paper.
            
                    A letter was read announcing the winning of the prize given by the Star for the
                        best program. As a token of appreciation to the able program committee, they were given a rising
                        vote of thanks and it was decided that a copy of the Stew with the prize announcement be
                        preserved in the club archives.
                    The $25.00 check was shown to the members and it was voted to use this check to defray
                        the expenses of Mrs. Demarcus 
                            Brown
                         for guest day.
                
            The Star gave the following lengthy analysis of the program:
            
            "It shows originality in adopting available program helps and in its unique plan of
                    assigning responses on a single subject for each member throughout the year." (This, I
                    regret to say, was not as original as the judges imagined. We found it on somebody else's
                    program.) "This method," the Star went on, 
                        not only eliminates duplication of responses—we are all familiar with
                            "Mine's been given"—but is a good way to keep in touch
                            with federation news and the work of the various departments .… The attempt to
                            cover a whole continent in one year's study is a somewhat ambitious one, but
                            perhaps more likely to be successful in the case of this continent than any other
                            … , The decisive factor in determining the decision of the judges, however, was
                            the fact that the program was a systematic and continuous study of a single subject, and at
                            the same time so interesting that the members cannot fail to be both entertained and
                            informed.
                    
            
            The Star printed copies of our program and sent them out as samples of what a club
                    program should be. We were pretty set up. We were so set up that we did it again and again. We got
                    to be such regular prize winners that other clubs said there was no use for them to enter the
                    contest at all. Finally, they made rules that barred us from winning any more prizes in certain
                    classifications.
            Two years later, when Lydia Lambert was program chairman and Laura Long, president, we did it again.
                    Our program on 
                        Canada
                     won the Star's $25.00. The Sunday Star for January 6, 1929, made the announcement. "The first prize is awarded the 
                        Columbus
                     Culture Club for a carefully worked out program which conforms to the five requirements
                    of the contest. The study of 
                  
                            Canada
                        , Our Northern Neighbor, is a carefully unified whole in which the book reviews
                    are placed against a background of geography and history. …"
            We took our success more calmly that time. Edith Rich-man, wife of Judge Frank Richman, wrote the
                    minutes of the July 7 meeting. It was also voted to express the appreciation of the club to the
                    program committee for making it possible for them to win first prize in the contest and it was
                    suggested that an account of the prize winning be pasted in the secretary's book. Mrs.
                    Annie Newsom asked the club to go on record as favoring the bill for a new State Library building.
                    …" All this is one paragraph.
            The year before, we had missed the prize, but pasted in  the
                    margin of the secretary's book is the clipping from the Star of January
                    1, 1928. "Additional honorable mention is given the following clubs: The 
                        Columbus
                     Culture Club, for its program on The Sea, a unique program, varied, original, and
                    stimulating to the imagination. In its topics is the fascination of the sea, in fact and in fancy,
                    in history or in literature."
            Again we took first place in 1931–1932—a championship prize, to which only
                    clubs who have won first place in former contests are eligible. By that time, we'd been
                    ruled out of the other contests. That was the sixth year the Star had sponsored
                    the contest. It was the third time we had won first place. That time it was Mary King, president,
                    and Merle Reeves, program chairman, who looked at us from the club pages of the Sunday Star of January 17, 1932. The story beneath the picture began in this manner: 
                        Championship Prize, $20.00—To the 
                                Columbus
                             Culture Club for its program on the air, aeronautics and radio. The two
                            subjects, aviation and radio, are treated in a similar way as two parallel aspects of modern
                            life and an effect of unity is achieved. The titles, though somewhat hackneyed, indicate an
                            interesting course of study and a good bibliography is included.
                    We would have been $20.00 the poorer, had any of us remembered that science was
                    not one of the subjects our constitution allowed us to investigate fully.
            We had gotten completely away from our habit of studying distant lands, and were back where we had
                    started from at the club's very first meeting—our own country. Period Biography
                    and Contemporary Literature of the 
                        United States
                     in the Nineteenth Century sounds clumsy to read, but we were beginning to feel our way
                    into American thought. The following year our subject was These

                    year of art, and two of music and drama. All through the ages, this has been the most effective way
                    for women to treat wars —by ignoring them as completely as possible.
            The Culture Club has lived through three wars. When it was organized, we were soon to go to war with 
                        Spain
                    . Mary Ann Long's son, John, was being graduated from West Point just in time
                    to go off to 
                        Cuba
                    . We've studied 
                        Cuba
                    . Remember our Pan-American programs ? There is an item in  Edith Richman's notes concerning one of these Pan-American
                    programs, April 17, 1933. "Mrs. Overshiner described the use of the rhumba, a primitive
                    musical instrument of 
                        Cuba
                    , and two of them were circulated among those present."
            Forty years later, Laura Long's son, Philip, was being graduated from West Point just in
                    time to go to the South Pacific. We have studied the South Sea Islands, too, and 
                        Australia
                    , and 
                        Japan
                    . Just mention a subject—any subject— and I'll give you
                    the name of a Culture Club member who, for a period of a few weeks, was an authority on that
                    subject.
            Sometimes those papers over which we had labored paid off in other ways, too. Lucy 
                        Clay
                    , our only member who belonged to the club the full fifty years of its existence, had a
                    paper in 1918 on Persian rugs. She became so interested in the subject that she made herself an
                    authority on rugs. She went all over the state giving talks at club guest days on Oriental rugs. And
                    once, when a Syrian came to town selling what he claimed were genuine Orientals, my husband sent him
                    up for Mrs. 
                        Clay
                     to see what he had, for he suspected the man was a fakir. Mrs. 
                        Clay
                     took one look at his collection, and he left town in a hurry. So if it hadn't
                    been for one Culture Club paper, 
                        Columbus
                     might have been nicely fleeced.
            In the secretary's annual report for the year 1935–1936, the Star contest is again mentioned. "On February second," says the report,
                        
                        the Misses Volland entertained the club with a tea at the 
                                Columbus
                             Tea Room. This was the first of two interesting programs on The Jew. Mrs.
                            Haymond set the stage by playing Dvorak's "Humoresque"
                            .… and Mrs. Anna Newsom had a paper on The Jew in America. Mrs. Millie Voris gave
                            the biographies of two Jewish philanthropists. On. February 16th, at Mrs.
                            Haymond's, the club was delighted to have as a guest Mrs. Leah Wolf Kroot, who
                            generously gave us a program of Jewish music—religious and folk tunes. We mention
                            these programs particularly because they gave us great enjoyment, even though the Star program editor told us they spoiled the unity of our year's
                            work (These 
                                United States
                             In Transition) and made us get second prize instead of first in the
                        contest.
                    
            
            We kept on winning prizes. Miriam Sigmund writes in her annual report for 1939–1940:
                    "Recognition of this very excellent program (Art For Art's Sake) was given the 
                        Columbus
                     Culture Club at the State meeting of the Indiana Federation  at 
                        Indianapolis
                     when Mrs. Grow, the Art Chairman, announced the awarding of the prize etch'ng,
                    ‘The Patriarch’ ... by L. O. Griffith, of 
                        Nashville
                    . The etching is valued at $22.00." Lillian Volland was program
                    chairman that year. And the following year, Mrs. Nussmeier writes in her notes: "At the
                    March 17th meeting .… announcement was made of a prize of $10.00 awarded the
                    club by the Indiana Federation of Clubs. This was in recognition of an outstanding program planned
                    by Mrs. Gordon Ritter, Mrs. B. K. Zaring and Mrs. Elmer Dean." The next year we won no more
                    prizes but Dorothy Baker records in her minutes, "The study (of Outposts of Democracy)
                    uncannily followed the war, giving the members a better background for what was taking place . ..
                    ."
            During the war years, the members were so busy with so many things that there was little time left
                    for the club. Programs were streamlined to four and five meetings a year, and this was not enough to
                    keep interest alive. You get out of anything in proportion to what you put into it. The rich
                    heritage of the club has resulted from rich investment of thought and research. The wisdom of the
                    past is about the only absolute this changing world knows, and it doesn't seem very wise to
                    throw it away now, just when we might learn the most from it. Personally, I hope we offer the same
                    sturdy resistance to outside pressures as did our predecessors; that we, too, can take a war and
                    reconstruction in our stride, concerning ourselves with things of the spirit.
            The complete set of yearbooks, and the nearly complete set of secretary's books offer a
                    wealth of interesting material of social history, and speak eloquently of the faithful work of a
                    long line of club secretaries. Every activity of the club has been faithfully
                    recorded—even reviews of club papers have been written. Dates of influenza epidemics, of
                    floods and wars can be traced through the minutes. Engagements, weddings and births, sicknesses and
                    death are set down in the records. It is indeed regrettable that the notes for the past few years
                    lack the rich detail of the earlier minutes. Can it be that our young women, busy with their own
                    affairs, are losing that fine sense of continuity, of each generation being linked to the generation
                    before it and to the one succeeding, that is the natural right of all women? And is it
                    not important that a little group of women with families have worked together "for mutual
                    improvement" over a period  of fifty years?
                    Is it not important that they were women who wished to see the world better, and to find themselves
                    wiser at the end of their journey through life? Surely, in the confusion of life today,
                    such clubs as the 
                        Columbus
                     Culture Club, with its gentle prodding towards study, can give its members a
                    perspective and breadth of vision that has always been and always will be the fruit of true
                culture.

            THE LETTERS OF DECIUS
            
                    Edited by John D. Barnhart⋆
               
                
            The Letters of Decius is one of the early publications written in Indiana
                    Territory. It is a criticism of Governor William H. Harrison and his political associates, embodied
                    in five letters, which were previously published in the newspapers. Copies of the newspapers seem
                    not to have survived. The author was later forced to retract the charges against Harrison, but a
                    forced retraction carries little weight. Jacob P. Dunn thought that William McIntosh wrote the
                    letters, because of "their intense bitterness, the skill with which they are composed, and
                    their subsequent appearance in pamphlet form. …" Dunn considered them to be
                    unjust to Harrison in many respects but not as to the slavery question.1 Logan
                    Esarey was not particularly impressed with the letters, but regarded Isaac Darneille as the
                        author.2 Miss Goebel considered it impossible to sift the truth of the
                    charges and agreed with Esarey that Darneille was the author. "Considering all the
                    circumstances, it seems wise," she wrote, "not to place much dependence upon
                    either the accusation or the retraction."3 She gave the work greater
                    consideration than Esarey or Dunn, but no one has attempted a detailed evaluation. Perhaps, they are
                    not worth such attention, but they do need to be made available to students of the history and
                    literature of Indiana.
            Isaac Darneille appears without doubt to be the author although it is possible that William Mcintosh
                    may have had some connection with them. Harrison stated that Darneille was the author.4 A letter of Darneille to John Breckinridge, October 22, 1803, and the enclosure bear
                    such resemblance to the Letters of Decius that they must have been written by the
                    same person.

            Three letters of Darneille, including the letter to Breckinridge, and a petition concerning Darneille
                    are published with the Letters of Decius, because they give some further
                    information about Darneille and about conditions in Indiana Territory. The Letters of
                        Decius are republished because of their scarcity. Copies of the latter are in the Library
                    of the 
                        Boston
                     Athenaeum, 
                  Boston, Massachusetts
               , and in the Library of Congress. The copy in
                    the 
                        Boston
                     Athenaeum was microfilmed and used with the permission of the library authorities.
            The letters under Darneille's own name are more restrained, while those under the name
                    "Decius" were written in the extremely violent style of political controversy of
                    that day. The year before the Letters of Decius were published, Benjamin Parke, a
                    reputable political leader of Indiana, called William Mcintosh a thief, a filcher, a pilferer, a
                    knave, a puppy, a coward, and an unprincipled soundrel,–all in one letter.5 In contrast, Darneille was a more skillful writer than Parke, using faint praise,
                    maddening insinuations, ridicule, sarcasm, and rapier like thrusts. His letters betray considerable
                    ability, but do not carry conviction in respect to his more serious charges. His judgment of men and
                    events has not stood the test of time.
            The author was thought to have come to the West from Mary and and to have been a minister. He was
                    appointed an attorney for the 
                        United States
                     in 
                        Hamilton
                     County, Northwestern Territory, November 27, 1794.6 He resigned
                    April 2. 1795. John Reynolds said that he came to Cahokia in 1794 and that he was the second
                    professed lawyer who emigrated to 
                        Illinois
                    . Perhaps he went to Cahokia after resigning the above position. Reynolds regarded him
                    as a polished gentleman, a classic scholar, a person of strong intellect, and an honest and moral
                    man, except in what Reynolds called his "gallantry" with the women of Cahokia.7 The petition of 1818, printed below, refers to him as a practicing lawyer and
                    an "Editor of a republican print." Presumably he had moved to 
                        Kentucky
                     before this. Reynolds wrote that he taught school in western 
                        Kentucky
                     where he died in 1830.

                     problem than the author. A detailed evaluation will not be
                    attemped, but something of the contents may be indicated. In the letter of May 10, 1805, he clearly
                    pointed out that a delegate to Congress under obligations to the governor would not represent the
                    interests of the people of the territory. Developments in Indiana Territory demonstrated the truth
                    of this observation. That Harrison manipulated the 
                        Vincennes
                     Convention of 1802 in order to secure the support of the territorial leaders for his
                    reappointment as governor was charged in the letter of August 1. That the governor endeavored to
                    guide the course of events and that his success as governor depended upon his ability in this matter
                    seems a more likely interpretation, although Darneille may have been substantially correct. He also
                    asserted that Harrison was active in securing the second stage of territorial government, just two
                    years after he had opposed it. Here he referred to a letter supposedly written by Harrison opposing
                    the advance to the second stage in 1802, which is not known to be in existence. Historians have
                    accepted his statement in this matter. They have not so readily accepted his statement that Harrison
                    was universally detested. The third letter was addressed to Benjamin Parke on May 10, 1805. In this
                    letter he became more extreme, stating that Park was destitute of principle, a sychophant, and an
                    aristocrat who was bewildered and lost, but who was expected as the territorial delegate to Congress
                    to secure a second reappointment for Harrison. He then broke into sarcasm and ridicule. In a fourth
                    letter, which was dated October 15, 1805, and addressed to Governor Harrison, he accused him of
                    being a Federalist under President Adams, but a Republican under President Jefferson, and of
                    refusing to confirm land titles unless the applicants signed a petition requesting the
                    governor's reappointment. Finally, in the fifth letter, which he addressed to James 
                        Madison
                    , Secretary of State, he presented eleven formal charges against the governor, four of
                    which he certified were true, while the remainder he said he believed to be true. In the first of
                    these he revealed that Harrison had refused to confirm a land claim for him, which establishes a
                    motive for his hostility to Harrison. The charges included improper appointments to office, improper
                    conduct in office, interference with the courts and the right of petition, and opposition to the
                    division of the territory. Throughout the letters runs the accusation that Harrison and his
                    followers maintained a political machine to control territorial 
                    affairs and to keep themselves in office. Even more pronounced is the evidence that there was
                    dissatisfaction in the 
                        Illinois
                     Country with Harrison's policies and his distribution of patronage. During the
                    time that the 
                        Illinois
                     counties were a part of Indiana Territory there was much turmoil, but when they were
                    given a separate territorial government their progress assumed the character of peace and
                    contentment. Perhaps, this confirms in a general way the broad and less extreme contentions of
                    Darneille. 
            The letter of Darneille to John Breckinridge of October 22, 1803, reflects the desire of the French
                    on both sides of the 
                        Mississippi
                     to be joined in one government after the purchase of 
                        Louisiana
                    , and of the people of 
                        Illinois
                     to be separated from Indiana Territory. It contains interesting comments on John Edgar
                    and John Rice Jones.
            The enclosure with the above letter, "Note on the Government of Indiana Territory"
                    clinches the authorship of the Letters of Decius and indicates that the
                    dissatisfaction with Harrison in the 
                        Illinois
                     counties was not new in 1805. Some of the charges are stated here which later were
                    repeated in the Letters of Decius. He developed more fully what he considered the
                    tyrannical organization of the governor and his friends, and his criticism of the Northwest
                    Ordinance is also more complete than in the Letters of Decius.
            
            In the letter to the Editor of the Indiana Gazette, September 8, 1804, Darneille
                    appeared as the champion of the French on the west side of the 
                        Mississippi
                    . The contentions which he set forth in this letter were probably sound in the main. The
                    "Petition of Members of the Bar of 
                        Kentucky
                    " at least helps to locate Darneille in his later years. It indicates that he
                    was favorably regarded by some of his neighbors at that time.
            Each student of Indiana History should make up his mind about the value of the writings of Darneille.
                    It is quite possible, however, that they deserve more credit than they have received.
            The Letters of Decius are reprinted as in the original. To have inserted the term
                        sic to indicate every error would have peppered the text with insertions. The

                        TO THE MEMBERS OP THE LEGISLATURE OF THE INDIANA TERRITORY.
                        GENTLEMEN,
                        THE people of the Indiana Territory have been led about in their opinion concerning
                                    the second grade of government by a whimsical and capricious executive; until at
                                    length it has been fixed upon them, eitheir with or without their
                                    consent.–This is not a time, however, to investigate the propriety of the
                                    measure. It is dene, and you are to act accordingly. Permit me to suggest that, it
                                    becomes you as the representative of the people, to guard in a particular manner, in
                                    future, against the undue influence of the executive. An important trust has
                                    devolved upon you by the voice of your fellow-citizens. Your intentions, in general,
                                    are believed to be good. There is no doubt, but that a majority of you, will
                                    discharge the duties of your station, with unblemished integrity; and to the best of
                                    your abilities. But you will pardon me when I premise that, many of you have been
                                    unacquainted with business of this kind; much less have you been accustomed to the
                                    stratagem, finesse and fraud, used by some of the more artful [3] members of the
                                    legislative assemblies, in order to carry some favorite point.–Let not
                                    the graceful address, the affable manners and the artful, engaging and facinating
                                    insinuations of the governor lead you from your duty. The business which will
                                    present itself before you, and on which you will be called upon for your suffrage,
                                    will be important; not only as it concerns yourselves, your liberty and your
                                    property; but as it concerns the public and posterity. It would be endless, indeed
                                    to enumerate the many important matters which will come before you; but I beg leave
                                    to draw your attention, in a particular manner, to an object, which seems to me of
                                    the first consideration; it is the choice of a representative to congress. This is
                                    an object, which at first view will strike your attention. You will consider that,
                                    this is the first time you have had it in your power, to make a direct communication
                                    to the national legislature. You have never yet been known to the general government
                                    as a people. It is admitted without doubt, that this representation to congress, is
                                    of the utmost importance to the people of the Indiana territory. What a numerous
                                    catalogue of grievances have already been stated to exist in the territory,
                                    removeable only by acts of congress. How often have you made representations to
                                    congress and prayed for [4] relief, without success?–I ask, if
                                    such grievances do exist, in the government, as have, and will if not removed,
                                    impede the population of your country?–In such case, (and on
                                    which your future happiness depends,) will it not be necessary to use the utmost
                                    circumspection in the choice of a representative ?–Will you
                                    trust a man without talents, without education and without experience upon such
                                    important matters ? –Then endeavor to make choice of a man of
                                    a different description– choose a representative of talents, erudition
                                    and experience. For this purpose, permit a friend to your country, to recommend
                                    Thomas T. Davis. I know that you would feel sensibly his loss from the seat which he
                                    now fills–but he would be able to render you more service  in congress than on the bench of the general court of
                                    your Territory.
                        I would beg leave to caution you at this early period, against the influence of the
                                    executive in the choice of your representative. Be assured that the instrument of the governor will never be the friend to
                                    the people. You wish such measures to be adopted, by the general government, as will
                                    encourage emigration to your country.–This is not the interest, and
                                    therefore not the wish of the governor. Whatever may be his public declarations in
                                    the Territory, [5] his communications and operations will accord with his interest.
                                    His government and salary will become precarious in the same proportion as
                                    population increases.
                        
                                    DECIUS
                                    May 10th, 1805.
                                
                     
                  
               
                
            
                    
                  
                     
                        TO THE MEMBERS OP THE LEGISLATURE OP THE INDIANA TERRITORY.
                        GENTLEMEN,
                        POLITICAL contests tend to destroy that social harmony so desirable under every civil
                                    institution. Personal animosity, a consequence of civil discord, destroys that
                                    mutual confidence and good faith which ought always to exist among the members of
                                    the same community: it excites mutual distrust and suspicion among neighbors and
                                    friends, kindles into public strife and faction, and often produces civil commotions
                                    and insurrections.
                        It was not, therefore, my intention to enter into any political discussion,
                                    respecting the government of your territory: but since there have appeared
                                    objections to what I advanced in a former letter to you; and since the matter
                                    contained in that letter has been misrepresented; in justice to Mr. Davis in justice
                                    to myself, and for the satisfaction of the public, I will now give you explanatory
                                    answers to some of the more [6] weighty objections that have appeared.
                        I well know that, calmly to animadvert on the conduct of public officers is a right
                                    inherent in the citizen, and guaranteed to every member of the community by the
                                    constitution of every free state. But this right ought not to degenerate into
                                    licentiousness; contrary to this principle, I am sorry to find that, 
                        A violent attack has been made against the matter contained in my letter to you of
                                    the 10th of May last. Two letters under different signatures, are the productions of
                                    one and the same man. His literary and political character and language are so well
                                    known that, a man of the most moderate information in this line, cannot mistake it.
                                    His elegant expressions, "foisted," "impertinent
                                    fellow," "mouth piece and puppet," "ignorance
                                    and stupidity," pragmatic whiffler," and a variety of others of
                                    equal taste and elegance in the republic of letters which abound in his political
                                    essays, under a variety of signatures, are a collection of fine words and
                                    expressions peculiar to himself, and shew to the world that his imagination is not
                                    by any means sterile, but on the contrary, abundantly furnishes him with a command
                                    of the most choice epithets and metaphors in the English  tongue. A happy circumstance, gentlemen for the
                                    prosperity of your country, is that, he hap- [7] pens to be a member of your own
                                    body: for with his natural turn of mind, and present political disposition,
                                    accompanied with great talents and the profoundest erudition and eloquence, much,
                                    very much indeed, may be hoped for. But I would not by any means, gentlemen, advise
                                    you to submit calmly, without accurate investigation, to any of his
                                    propositions–for the greatest men may err! And as a proof of that, that
                                    gentleman has already erred in the most egregious manner, I shall call on you
                                    gentlemen, to give testimony in support of the facts which I shall now state, in
                                    contradiction to his famous letter to Decius and to Mr. Stout. And although I cannot
                                    boast of elegant diction, and correct composition, yet if I can bring to your
                                    recollection, certain facts in plain common language, it will answer my purpose: for
                                    you must then say that, what I have advanced is true.
                                
                        About three years ago, the governor, publicly, and violently opposed the second grade
                                    of government: witness his letter to a friend which found its way into a 
                                        Louisville
                                     gazette. Last year the governor was active in bringing about the second
                                    grade: witness the polls of the election for that purpose, at 
                                        Vincennes
                                    , where he voted in favor of it. Is this not whimsical and
                                    capricious?–Can this be called consistent political conduct in
                                    the executive?–Has [8] any influx of population into your
                                    territory, authorized this political change in the governor's
                                    opinion?–A reference to the polls of the election for the
                                    second grade of government will prove that the whole number of suffrages for and
                                    against the measure, did not amount to five hundred freeholders. This proves that
                                    population has not encreased. But a majority of these supported by the
                                    governor's opinion, is now said to be a "large
                                    majority!!" 
                        It is well known that, previous to this famous letter of the governor, against the
                                    second grade of government, the people, whether right or wrong, had generally
                                    petitioned the governor to adopt the measure. A declaration of his own opinion,
                                    accompanied with an exagerated calculation of the expences incident to this form of
                                    government, alarmed the people, by a representation of heavy taxes–and
                                    they immediately changed their opinions, for no other reason than those stated by
                                    the governor. Was not this undue influence?
                                
                        A variety of questions have been put to me, some of which have been answered already.
                                    There remains one, however, which it may be well to answer in a particular manner.
                                    It is asked, "on what occasion he (meaning the governor) found laqueys, and
                                    understrappers so useful in his measures." 
                         [9] Why really I am surprised that such a question should be asked: (in such
                                    handsome language too, for it must be admitted that the words, "laqueys and
                                    understrappers," vibrate most gratefully in the ears of the delicate
                                    readers, and judges of fine language) and that too in the face of all the world, who
                                    will testify to the truth of what I shall state in answer!– 
                        When a change of administration had taken place in the general government, and
                                    federalism, the tenure of Mr. Harrison's commission,  had rendered his government precarious–do
                                    you not recollect the petitions that were circulated for signers in the fall 1802,
                                    addressed to the president, humbly praying that Mr. Harrison might be reappointed
                                    governor of the Indiana Territory ? Who was it but "laqueys and
                                    understrappers," who drew up the petitions in his favor, and put them in
                                    circulation? Do you not remember the convention holden at 
                                        Vincennes
                                     in the winter of 1802–3? Here Mr Harrison with
                                    his usual address, influenced the whole convention. It will be asked, in what did
                                    Mr. Harrison influence the convention? In answer, I will ask if you do
                                    not know that, by his art and intrigue he gulled a majority of the convention into
                                    his measures ? Was he not the man who proposed to the convention to
                                    recommend John Rice Jones to the presi-[10] dent, for commission of first judge of
                                    the territory, and that too contrary to the wishes of a great majority of the
                                    citizens of the territory? And did he not by his instruments get himself
                                    recommended by the convention to the president for a reappointment? Do
                                    you not recollect the artful manner in which the governor succeeded with the
                                    convention in the appointment of an agent to congress? Do you not believe
                                    that, that agent, to the best of his abilities (in gratitude, for he is a man of
                                    some principles) would have sacraficed the Indiana territory, and all its
                                    inhabitants to the ambition of the governor?– 
                        But the members of the convention were not blamable ; a great majority of whom were
                                    honest industrious farmers. They acted without any sinister views themselves, and
                                    suspected none in others. Advantages were taken of them and they were led into
                                    measures, on which, a few days after, they reflected with regret.
                        The conduct of the governor is well known, and therefore the round assertions of
                                    sycophants and parasites will not be listened to in support of an executive, who is
                                    almost as universally detested as he is known.
                        Notwithstanding all that Mr. Harrison's friend and panegyrist may say, there
                                    are gentlemen in the eastern states, who are pos- [11] sessed of great taste for
                                    fine language and diction in composition– but at the same time, they will
                                    not be led away by a flow of fine words and expressions. They will consult reason
                                    and be guided by it. They will draw conclusions from a statement of facts, on which
                                    they will form their judgments. The good lad "Ned," ought to take advice. and write nothing for the
                                    future for his friend Harrison; for every thing he says in his favor, is construed
                                    by the public, and particularly in the literary world as satirical against him. To
                                    render the most essential service to Mr. Harrison his boy "Ned,"
                                    ought to be kept perfectly silent.– 
                        In justice to Mr. Davis, I most frankly confess that I never consulted him on the
                                    publication of my letter to you, recommending him as your delegate to congress. Nor
                                    did I know at that time, that he would have accepted of the appointment ; nor have I
                                    yet spoken to him about it, nor does he know me. But I thought and yet think that he
                                    is the man you ought to send. Mr. Davis is known, as a member of congress by
                                    representation, to be active, firm and independent, His experience, information, erudition and native goodness of
                                    
                                    heart are sufficient appologies for my having proposed him as a
                                    candidate, & it is believed that he would act with recitude of principle as
                                    well as [12] disposition in discharge of the duties of a representative.
                        I had reason to believe that Mr. Harrison intended to use his influence for his
                                    favorite to be elected, who certainly does not merit the appointment, but from whom
                                    Mr. Harrison might expect much more than from Mr. Davis. I therefore gave you to
                                    understand that, in my opinion, you ought to beware of executive
                                        influence ; and I believe that your most essential interest
                                        depend on this particular. Nor can I well understand how this can be
                                    considered as unfair. In politics, it is necessary to strike at the source of
                                    impending evils, in order to remove them. And where is the harm, if Mr. Davis should
                                    be elected by an exposition of the truth against Mr.
                                    Harrison?

                        CONGRATULATORY ADDRESS.
                        TO THE HON. B. PARK, ESQ. DELEGATE TO CONGRESS PROM THE INDIANA TERRITORY.
                        SIR,
                        On the late unexpected event of your election to congress, permit me to address you.
                                    The station in which you are now placed renders you sufficiently conspicuous [13] to
                                    draw from your numerous admirers those soft and flattering addresses, so grateful to
                                    the feelings of an aspiring and enterprising young man.
                        Know then that, among the numerous concourse of your humble devotees, none is
                                    inspired with a more ardent zeal in discharge of this duty than myself. You may rest
                                    assured, sir, that I shall speak the language of your best friends. Then without
                                    waiting the opportunity of a formal introduction, you will not be surprised by my
                                    approaching you in this direct manner.
                        You know me not : because, perhaps, the etiquette of your station had not permitted
                                    you to take notice of me in the more humble, but enviable walks of life. In the
                                    character of Decius, however, I have had the honor to be taken
                                    notice of, not only by you, but by your Patron and
                                    superiors.–In that character, therefore, I shall now address you ; and I
                                    shall take the liberty also, of investigating your political conduct under the
                                    appropriate character of "Ned," which you have assumed.
                        Whatever regard you may have had for the principles and language of a gentleman ; and
                                    whatever you might have thought of the principles of honor and delicacy in the
                                    several conversations which you have had, and in the composition of the several
                                    letters which you have written concerning [14] me, and what I have advanced relative
                                    to the government of the Indiana Territory, I leave to the world to judge.
                        But, sir, I wish to remind you that you here start up to defend a cause in which you
                                    have no apparent interest. The objections made 
                                    to the conduct of the executive in my communications to the members of legislature
                                    of the Indiana Territory, were objects on which you ought not to have displayed your
                                    wit. As a member of congress you ought to have manifested a certain degree of
                                    impartiality. What confidence can be placed in you as a delegate to congress, by the
                                    citizens of the territory, when under the flimsy shadow of "NED"
                                    you attempt violently to support a tottering executive, against whom there are
                                    innumerable complaints ! Destitute of principle as of argument, you denounce in the
                                    most vulgar manner, the writer against a tyrant, the oppressor of the people ; and
                                    at the same time you expose yourself to that unlimited ridicule and derision, of
                                    which, the wits of the times are so ready to take advantage. As you have thus
                                    exposed yourself in defence of your friend you must not expect to escape with
                                    impunity; for you must be sensible (if you are sensible of any thing) that you are
                                    not provided with the necessary apparatus for such an enterprise.– You
                                    must therefore fall as other heroes have done in similar circumstances.
                         [15] In terms little suited to the gravity of your station, culled from among the
                                    flowers of the Billingsgate and Grub-street dialects, and raised to the superlative
                                    degree of furious declamation–you have began hostilities. It now becomes
                                    me to take a certain position to maintain the ground and support the cause. That
                                    position I have taken and you may now discharge your heaviest artillery. But Mr.
                                    Park, would it not be well to reason a little on the matter? Then permit
                                    me to propound a few enquiries.
                        When as a member of congress you made an attack upon a private citizen for having
                                    published a statement of facts to the members of the legislature of the Indiana
                                    territory, respecting the governor, what could you have thought about that article
                                    in the constitution, which guarantees to the citizens the freedom of speech and of
                                    the press?– Did you not feel on that occasion like a little
                                    despot?–Did you not adopt the conduct of the government of
                                    which you are the diminutive representative? Did you not think of
                                    aristocracy and federalism? Of the sedition law &c.
                                    &c? Did not a thousand chmeras of this kind agitate your
                                    mind? And did you not blame in your heart the mild administration of Mr.
                                    Jefferson?–Yes certainly ; and so would any other little
                                    sycophant in the like dilemma.
                        In consequence of this attack, Mr. Park, [16] I would not pretend to use any uncivil
                                    language to you, such as to call you a liar, a rachal or the like ; for you declare
                                    yourself in the gazette, and the world may judge of you. For my own part if you will
                                    permit me to form an opinion of you from your style and manner of communication in
                                    your furious political disquisitions, I will only beg leave to infer that in my
                                    opinion you could not have been destined by nature to occupy any of the first
                                    offices of the nation, nor to become one of the great luminaries
                                    of the republic ; nor to shine in any of the brilliant circles of life. Nor do I believe that your philosophic researches will transmit to posterity any
                                        important discoveries ; nor will your name resound in the
                                    anals of fame as that of a Solon or a Lycurgus.
                                    On the contrary I conclude that you were destined by nature to creep
                                        through  the inferior walks of life, and die
                                        in obscurity and be fogotten–perhaps you might have made a good
                                    private citizen, if so I should have respected you in that capacity. But this desire
                                    of becoming a politician, a delegate to congress a legislator! This mission on which
                                    you are appointed, has put you out of your road, has deranged the order of nature
                                    with respect to you, has lifted your out of your proper sphere, you are bewildered
                                    and lost.
                        Anxious as you are to shewyour wit in sup- [17] port of your friend Harrison, (who,
                                    by the bye thinks no more of you, than he does of any other of his creatures) you
                                    ought to do it by dint of reason and argument, drawn from certain
                                    facts–and not fly into a passion and abuse a private citizen, for, you
                                    know not what. But even this you ought to reserve until you arrive
                                    at the post of your destination. For if you harp on your pasquinades at present,
                                    they will become stale and ridiculous before you can twist them into the real
                                    service of your friend.
                        "You have no doubt, been instructed by your friend, as to the great object of your mission ; which is very plain to all the world who
                                    wish to know it. It will be your duty as well as you can, agreeably to your
                                    instructions, to keep the company of the members of congress, & tell them
                                    & the several ministers of state, handsome stories about Mr. Harrison, and
                                    say how popular he is in the territory, in order that he may be assured of his
                                    commission. You may do this with much ease, and some truth : for Mr. Harrison is a
                                    man of some merit, has handsome manners, and a certain Jane sais
                                    quoi, to acquire popularity with a certain description of men; in conversation he is
                                    sprightly and gay–can repeat a theatrical performance, and mim-mick a
                                    blackguard as well as I ever saw a man in my life. All this, and much more repeated
                                    by you, and [18] embellished by the fertile invention of your imagination and
                                    language, might be of service to Mr. Harrison, and he is well assured that you would
                                    not injure him intentionally ; it would be the height of ingratitude, for it is to
                                    him you owe your political existence and consequence ; for which reason I would
                                    advise you to take care, and not suffer yourself to fly out into such furious
                                    transports of passion ; for, in such a state of enthusiasm, you might let slip
                                    something injurious to your friend. The consequence of such a mistake, as it might
                                    effect yourself, would be nothing ; for by this time all your
                                    acquaintance and many others know you well. You have nothing, in
                                    the strictest sense of the expression, to loose, but your friend has a great deal. I
                                    said all your acquaintance by this time must know you well; yes & I make no
                                    doubt, but that the imaginations of many have been upon the torture to find out the
                                    reason why the people of the Indiana territory have been induced to make use of a
                                    person of your talents upon such business! But there are also many gentlemen with
                                    whom you have found means to be made acquainted, whose penetration has led them to
                                    the truth of the matter ; and they have seen that the contrivance of a legislature
                                    and a delegate to congress, is not a business in which the people of the [19]
                                    territory are much concerned : no, it is your friend Mr. Harrison who is interested,
                                    and you are most properly supposed to be 
                                    his instrument, under the mask of delegate to congress for the
                                    Indiana territory. Should you then conduct yourself in a cool & deliberate
                                    manner, gentlemen who even know the contrivances, would notwithstanding be induced
                                    to believe what you might say in that simple aukward manner which
                                    you sometimes put on, and which seems to become your person so well, that one would
                                    believe it to be natural–but when you break out into those enthusiastic
                                    transports of passion, the order and symetry of your features entirely distorted ;
                                    the hedious frowns and unparallelfed grimaces that you make, the spleen and gall
                                    that you vent on such occasions, accompanied with the most obscene and indelicate
                                    expressions, with the manners and gesticulations of a perfect simpleton, you must
                                    certainly place your friend Harrison in the most eminent danger. For notwithstanding
                                    the many handsome lessons which you will no doubt receive from your friend before
                                    you set out on this important embassy, yet the difficulty of making yourself
                                    acquainted in this new sphere of action, with the art and intrige necessary to Play
                                    your part to advantage, is too great to be su' mounted by a man of your composi-
                                    tion and capacity in the course of [20] a few years. To do business of this kind, it
                                    requires a considerable fund of good sense handsome and engaging manners, and
                                    agreeable address, and all these attached to a person of a different mould from that
                                    long uncouth frame that you have to trainabout the city of 
                                        Washington
                                    . All these things put together, I must conclude that your friend, not you, must be in some danger. Else why this violent attack, by
                                    a person in your station, upon a simple individual?–You break
                                    out like a storm, like a hurricane, and in the most tempestuous and turbulent
                                    manner, you hurl out execrations against me as well as against the
                                    subject matter of my communications.– 
                        But, Mr. Park, you have attacked me, and now pray what can you do? You
                                    cannot put me out of office, nor oust me of my pension, for I have neither. You
                                    cannot destroy my future expectations, nor blast the embryo of
                                    future elevation, for I most frankly declare to you, and to the world, that I have
                                    no pretentions whatever to any public employment. In despite of all your wanton shew
                                    of malice, of vengeance, and of I know not what, I shall still live happy in my
                                    little retirement, in the cultivation of the social virtues and in the great circle
                                    of my friends, when your spleen, fury and rancour, will finally recoil on yourself,
                                    your vain efforts will prove abortive, and you [21] will at last become the victim
                                    of your own folly and extravagance. Poor unhappy man! I lament your fate! For
                                    although a misfortune of this kind, would seem of very little consequence to a man
                                    in the ordinary walks of life yet from the elevated situation in which you now
                                    believe yourself to stand, the fall, the tremendous fall! Which will inevitably
                                    happen, will not only shock your whole vital system, as an immense dischare of
                                    electrical fire, but will finally annihilate your political existence. Is it not a
                                    dreadful precipice on which you now stand? From which, believe me, the
                                    slightest touch will send you down, down to the very bottom of the abyss below,
                                    where you will find yourself in entire darkness and obscurity. What an awful
                                    spectacle presents itself immediately to the imagination of  the fallen creature! When he reflects
                                    on the beauties and elegance of the eminence on which he formerly stood! Would you
                                    not prefer the final dissolution of your terrestial fabric? Would you not
                                    prefer to fall from the tarpean rock? Where you would only terminate this
                                    transitory existence, and leave behind you that uncouth mass of stupid clay, but
                                    where there would remain a probability that your fame would occupy too or three
                                    lines in history?–Yes, certainly, say you. But, Mr. Park, the
                                    probability is, that you will fall before you have dons any thing in [22] your
                                    mission to congress or elsewhere, sufficiently remarkable to occupy one line in
                                    history.
                        It requires very little skill in the art of divination to foretell that such men as
                                    you will never immortalize themselves by any important service rendered to the
                                    public. But there are many such, who from a disposition to be talked of, and to rise in the world, as they term it, would do any
                                        thing to attract the notice and attention of the people: some of whom have
                                    had the honor to he raised up in the. world, several feet higher
                                    than they wished, amidst the shouts and acclamations of thousands of spectators ;
                                    but such marks of distinction are soon over, and then all is at an end ; so fickle
                                    are the tides of popularity, and the caprices of fame !!! 
                        Should you think fit to beat a retreat and call off your legions, I assure you that
                                    you may do it with safety and without prusuit ; for I have no disposition to spend
                                    my time in a contest with such men as you. Believe me, sir, I should blush to wear
                                    the laurels of such a victory. If you will not raise the siege, but continue to
                                    pester me with your squibbs, I shall take an opportunity of answering all your
                                    invectives at leisure. But you had better take advice, and "cease viper,
                                    for you bite against a file!"

                                    October 10th, 1805.
                                
                     
                  
               
                
            
                    
                  
                     
                        [23] TO HIS EXCELLENCY WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON, GOVERNOR OP THE INDIANA TERRITORY
                        SIR,
                        YOUR friend and panegyrist is gone to proclaim your virtues and talents, to the house
                                    of representatives, the senate, and to the several ministers of state, at the city
                                    of 
                                        Washington
                                    . On your account, sir, I have furnished him with a letter of
                                    recommendation, which may serve him as an introduction among strangers. You are
                                    therefore under some obligation to me. But I shall claim no favors on that account,
                                    except it be in his absence, and in the recess of the legislature the honor of a
                                    correspondence with you. I shall therefore, without [24] further ceremony, take the
                                    liberty of addressing myself personally to you.
                        The immense deserts of Indiana have not yet produced a Brutus to extirpate the
                                    monarch, and bring about a reformation ; nor a Cato to oppose the tyranny of Sylla ;
                                    nor has the illustrous example of Philip of Macedon taught you to
                                        remember that you are a man.
                                
                        Raised to the sumit of human power in your government, you  consider yourself, at present, one of those superior
                                    beings, to whom common sense and plain truth are not permitted an
                                    audience. Accustomed for a long time, to the flattery of your courtiers, and to the
                                    fulsome, ironical and satyrical addresses which are printed and re-printed in your
                                    Gazette, you have entirely forgotten yourself, and you will, no doubt, proscribe the
                                    author of the present, as an intruder on your dignity and consequence.
                        But, sir, you must learn that human happiness and human glory, are fluctuating
                                    unstable possessions, and that one discordant voice, whose accents pierce with the
                                    irresistable shafts of truth, will penetrate the most secret recesses of your soul,
                                    and will embitter those splended convivial hours, where you are encircled with those
                                    satalites of despotism, whose reflected glory, like the golden vapors of the west,
                                    will di- [25] minish and become obscure and dark, as the great luminary descends
                                    below the horizon.
                        Nature has implanted in matter of the same texture and quality, a principle known
                                    among philosophers by the name of attraction, cohesion and magnetism. By this
                                    natural impulse, creatures of your own disposition and capacity flock around you,
                                    and are received and admitted into your favor and friendship ; and are even
                                    initiated into the secrets of your cabinet, and are made counsellors of state
                                    !!–Without a personal knowledge of you, sir, your are
                                    known to all the world by the creatures you keep about you as your companions and
                                    favorites.
                        An unbounded confidence in your own talents, is the greatest proof of your extreme
                                    weakness, untaught by precept and unawed by example, you launch out on a perilous
                                    and dangerous ocean, without one skilful mariner on board ; exposed on all sides to
                                    the fury of the elements, you cannot be surprised, should you ere long, experience
                                    the effects of your temerity on a Scylla or a Charybdis.
                        The commissions which honor you, render your conduct too conspicuous, even in a
                                    desert, to pass without notice. The pranks that you have played, to keep yourself in
                                    office, are publicly known. The art, [26] intrige and low cunning, that you have
                                    practised on a weak and credulous people, have marked you as an object of
                                    detestation. Men of honor and delicacy shudder at the baseness of the menns you have
                                    employed to bring about your measures. The premium mobile of your
                                    conduct is your salary. To every other consideration your are perfectly indifferent.
                        Under the auspices of Mr. Adams, secure in your government, without sufficient
                                    political information to foresee the change in favor of democracy, you spurned from
                                    before you the numerous petitions which were presented to you by the people, praying
                                    for the adoption of the second grade of government. You then displayed your
                                    eloquence in furious declamation against the measure, as ruinous to the infant
                                    settlements of the territory ; and denounced the legislature as the forerunner of
                                    innumerable evils, and of burthensome taxation. And you had the glory of a triumph
                                    over a passive and uninformed, but a virtuous people.
                        No sooner was Mr. Jefferson elected to the presidency, than you began to apprehend
                                    danger. Your conduct was then marked with the 
                                    most consumate duplicity ; which has been a prominent trait in your political
                                    character ever since. From the firmest federalist you wheeled about like [27] like
                                    the cock on a steeple and declared yourself a republican ! But a simple declaration
                                    of a change was not sufficient. You then found it necessary to have recourse to the
                                    very people, whose petitions you had rejected, to assist you in obtaining a
                                    reappointment. And for this purpose your imagination sugested several expedients, by
                                    which you calculated on success.
                        Your official influence and official power, you
                                    took care to put in action to bring about your measures. As to the former, those who
                                    think fit may judge from the multiplicity of commissions which you dealt out with a
                                    liberal hand, to men of every description, in order to procure their favor ; many of
                                    whom were thereby metamorphosed into petit tyrants your humble devotees. You even
                                    went so far as to commission three persons who had been indicted for horse stealing
                                    a few years before, to assure yourself of the interest, of their family who are
                                    numerous.
                        With respect to the latter, that is, your official power! During
                                    the summer of 1802 many persons put themselves to the trouble and expence of going
                                    from the western counties of the territory to Vin-cennes, to psesent their titles to
                                    lands, for confirmation, and you constantly refused to take their claims into
                                    consideration ; saying that you would go to the western counties [28] yourself for
                                    that purpose. Accordingly in the autumn in the same year, you visited the western
                                    counties, and took in the claims of land without deciding on them ; but said that
                                    you would consider of them at your leisure, after you returned to 
                                        Vincennes
                                    .
                        During your visit to the 
                                        Illinois
                                     country you let the people know that, it would be agreeable to you, if
                                    they would petition you to call a convention, under the pretence of considering the
                                    expediency of the admission of slavery into the territory. The people, unwilling to
                                    express a disapprobation, consented to your proposition. Petitions were made out but
                                    it took some time to procure signers. In the mean time you returned to 
                                        Vincennes
                                     ; and before the petitions were sent forward, you issued your
                                    proclamation, under the great seal of the territory, authorising elections to be
                                    holden for representatives to the convention–which you sent by express
                                    from 
                                        Vincennes
                                     to the western counties. And at the same time petitions were made out
                                    at 
                                        Vincennes
                                    , by your creatures and sent by the same express, to be signed by the
                                    people in the western counties for your reappointment.
                        In this situation you had the chances for success in your reappointment, the
                                    petitions for that purpose, which the people were in some measure bound to
                                    subscribe, as their claims for lands were yet undetermined ; [29] and should that
                                    fail the powerful aid of a convention, which you doubted not, would second your
                                    pretentions, seemed to assure you in the government. You had the good fortune to
                                    succeed in your projects. The convention not only recommended you to the president
                                    for a reappointment, but were induced to recommend one of your crertures [sic] for the commission of first judge of the territory &
                                    another was appointed agent to congress, at your special instance and request.
                        
                        During the operations of this masterpiece of policy, by which you gulled the people
                                    into your measures, you proscribed such men as were supposed to posses too much
                                    firmness and integrity to become the passive dupes of this barefaced intrige and
                                    duplicity ; and in order to effect the destruction of such men, you stooped from the
                                    station of a governor, to the low drudgery of fabrication, calumny, tale bearing and
                                    defamation. But this is not all, to such men you refused to confirm claims to lands,
                                    the titles to which were supported by the same documents and evidence, under which
                                    on other occasions, you did not hesitate to confirm lands to your favorites. And
                                    now, sir, instead of acting as the father of the people, you have become their
                                    oppressor. Instead of adopting concilatory measures to unite contending parties,
                                    [30] you have sown the seeds of discord in the community : you have become the bane
                                    of social harmony, and the chief mover of civil commotions.
                        But after all your efforts, your appointment thus fraudulently obtainened, was only
                                    for three years. You rationally apprehended that your conduct would ere long be
                                    investigated ; and you knew that it would not bear examination. Anxiety possessed
                                    your mind. You presently determined that it would be expedient to have recourse
                                    again to the weakness and credulity of the people for further support. To petition
                                    again would shew your weakness and betray your alarms and apprehensions to public
                                    observation and criticism. Another convention would be ridiculous. To propose and
                                    advocate the second grade of government, in the first instance, would, personally
                                    expose your tricks and duplicity to the public odium and censure. You therefore
                                    artfully set your creatures to work ; and your champion Park, with your assistance,
                                    behind the curtain, bullied the territory into your measures ! And with your
                                    influence, you have got him elected to congress. He knows the roll he has to
                                    play–I know it–and the world knows it.–Query, will
                                    mr. Park succeed in procuring a second reappointment for you at the next
                                    session?– 
                         [31] As a republican, sir, you would despise such measures, such artifice, such
                                    duplicity. As a real advocate for these principles which distinguish the present
                                    administration of ths [sic'] general government, you would say
                                    that six years in the commission of governor was long as any man ought to continue
                                    in office. And you would therefore disclaim all pretentions to a reappointment. But
                                    you will, now no doubt, adopt the finesse of soliciting a reappointment, as a
                                    justification and an honorable mark of public confidence in contradiction to the
                                    charges which are exhibited against you. But in this it is thought you will fail.
                        This, sir, is only a small sketch of the out-lines of your political conduct in the
                                    Indiana territory. I have merely suggested these things, to prove to you and to the
                                    world, that I know you, and aan acquainted with your stratagems, finesse and
                                    cunning. By the next mail I shall make formal charges against you, and you may
                                    prepare yourself to defend them, for they shall be of a very serious nature.
                        Now, sir, should you undertake to defend yourself against the charges which I have
                                    made and shall make against you, I shall expect that you will come forward calmly,
                                    dispassionately and fairly, and  justify
                                    yourself in your gazette, as a man of honor, and prove to the world if you can, that
                                    the [32] charges against you are groundless, and that your conduct has been upright
                                    and just and not adopt the pitiful subterfuge of demanding the name of the author or
                                    prosecuting the printer. Nothing but conscious guilt can suggest to you such violent
                                    proceedings : which alone would more than convince the world of the truth of all the
                                    charges against you.

                                    October 15th, 1805.
                                
                     
                  
               
                
            
                    
                  
                     
                        [33] A SKETCH OF CHARGES AGAINST WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON GOVERNOR OF THE INDIANA
                                    TERRITORY, ADDRESSED TO THE HONORABLE JAMES MADISON, SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES,
                                    TO BE BY HIM, LAID BEFORE THE PRESIDENT AND SENATE.
                        Article 1. Notorious partiality. In support of this charge it will appear that,
                                    governor Harrison granted lands to his favorites, and refused claims under the same
                                    circumstances, and supported by the like documents and evidence which were pre- [34]
                                    sented by those whom he supposed not in his interest. Witness a militia right
                                    granted to Louis Labossiere, and several others granted to Nicholas Jarrot as
                                    assignee of several persons resident at Peorias on the Illinois
                                    river ; and two claims of a similar nature, refused, on application of
                                    Isaac Darneille assignee of the first proprietors. The evidence on which the
                                    governor granted to Labossiere and Jarrot, may be seen on the records of the Indiana
                                    territory in possession of general Gibson secretary of the territory ; and the
                                    evidence of his having refused claims under the same circumstances and supported by
                                    the like documents and evidence, may be seen in the office of the register of the
                                    land office at Kaskaskias, and the governor's evasive answer in his own
                                    hand writing, in possession of Michael Jones, esq. Register of the land office.
                        Article 2. The cotinuance [sic] of a surveyor in office, against
                                    whom a charge of malfeasance had been made and supported in order to serve a friend
                                    ; to the great injury of the public. In the autumn of 1802, when governor Harrison
                                    was at Cahokia, complaints were made to him, by respectable persons against Danl.
                                    M'Cann surveyor of St. Clair county, charging him with malfeasance in
                                    office, as surveyor. The complaints were so well authenticated that, the [35]
                                    governor declared, in every public company in which he was during the time he stayed
                                    in St. Clair county, that M'Cann was a damned rascal, and that he deserved
                                    to be hanged ; and further that he would have him tryed by a jury
                                    at Hull's and break him. He accordingly had a mock trial at Hull's
                                    ; and on examination it appeared that, M'Cann as surveyor, had been
                                    employed by William Biggs, to survey a tract of land of 400 acres, and that he
                                    returned a platt and certificate of survey to governor St. Clair in the name of John
                                    Sullivan, in order that the grant or patent might issue to Sullivan who had set up a
                                    claim for the land to M'Cann. And notwithstanding no sort  of defence nor justification was made by
                                    M'Cann the governor did not break him, but continued him in office as
                                    surveyor. A person who was present at this mock trial, enquired of Shadrach Bond
                                    esquire, who would be appointed in the place of M'Cann ? Mr.
                                    Bond told the person that he had desired the governor to appoint his nephew Shadrach
                                    Bond, jr. who was then in the state of 
                                        Maryland
                                    , and who was not expected in the 
                                        Illinois
                                     country until the spring following, and that the governor had promised
                                    to keep M'Cann in office, notwithstanding his notorious malfeasance, until
                                    young Mr. Bond should arrive. Several other respectable persons, and whose abilities
                                    were [36] adequate to the duties of the office, had solicited the place, but the
                                    governor wished to do a favor to Mr. Bond, and therefore continued M'Cann
                                    in office, waiting the arrival of Mr. Bond. And M'Cann under these
                                    circumstances was continued in office two years afterwards, and until the office of
                                    surveyor was virtually done away by the late act of congress. Is not this a
                                    government of favorites ?– Witnesses to prove the above charge

                                    John Whiteside esquires.
                        Article 3. The appointment of improper persons to offices to gain
                                    popularity.–There are three persons of the name of Whiteside, appointed
                                    and commissioned in the county of St. Clair, to wit : William Whiteside appointed
                                    captain of militia, and justice of the court of Quarter-Sessions, Uel Whiteside,
                                    Justice of the Court of Quarter-Sessions, and William Witeside [sic] appointed captain of militia. This family and their connections are very
                                    numerous. And these appointments were made or promised at a time, when the governor
                                    courted popularity, & his creatures were handing about petition for his
                                    reappointment. All three of these persons were indicted for horse stealing a few
                                    years ago ; the records of which, is now in the general [37] court of the territory,
                                    or the general court of the state of 
                                        Ohio
                                    . They were not tried & honorably acquitted, but have got rid of
                                    the prossecutions, by the art and address of their attorney who had the trial
                                    continued over from term to term, until the witnesses died or absconded, on whose
                                    testimony, the prosecutions were instituted. Two of these persons have a seat on the
                                    bench of justice, because their family furnished many subscribers to the petition of
                                    the governor, and two command each a company of militia !!! 
                        Article 4. The governor employed a party of soldiers of the U. S. army in burning
                                    lime for his private use, on the head of the Wabash River,
                                    while he went to 
                                        Detroit
                                    . On the 31st of March 1803, governor Harrison and his suite, in his
                                    capacity of superintendant or Indian commissioner, obtained a party of military,
                                    consisting of one first lieutenant and Seargent, and twelve rank and file, to convey
                                    him in a splendid barge, to the head of the Wabash River. At
                                    Fort 
                                        Wayne
                                     he obtained a military escort down the Miami of the lake, and from
                                    thence was conveyed to 
                                        Detroit
                                     in a public barge or cutter, which had been sent for that purpose from 
                                        Detroit
                                    . The party taken from Fort 
                                        Knox
                                     at

                                    , were not ordered back, when they had conveyed the governor to the head
                                    of the river, nor put [38] under the direction of the commanding officer at Fort

                                    , but employed  by the governor in
                                    burning lime for his own private use ; exposed to hunger and thirst, and surrounded
                                    without the means of defence, by a party of 
                                        Missouri
                                     indians. The public cloathing was destroyed, and they were ordered back
                                    to 
                                        Vincennes
                                    , in parties of two or three at different times and in separate peragues
                                        [sic], with cargoes of lime and merchandize for the governor.

                        Article 5. The manner in which Will. Henry Harrison disposed of public property
                                    consigned to him, as superintsndant of Indian affairs. On or about the 30th of
                                    August 1803, Mr. Harrison distributed the annuities to the Indians resident on the 
                                        Wabash
                                     in conformity to the treaty of Greenville. Before the annuities were
                                    delivered he obtained a party of soldiers from the garrison to assort the packages.
                                    During the assortment of the goods, there were found among them several pieces of
                                    chintzes and callicoe3 of a superior quality and fashionable
                                    figure. I do not say, however, that governor Harrison embezzeled any of these, but
                                    will leave that to future [39] enquiry ; but he permitted several of his favorites
                                    to purchase callicoes of an inferior quality and exchange them for callicoes and
                                    chintzes of a superior quality, which were sent by the authority of the 
                                        United States
                                     to the superintendant, not to be by him bartered and trafficked away
                                    for goods of an inferior quality, but to be delivered to the Indians faithfully and
                                    without fraud or collusion.–Witnesses to prove the facts general Gibson,
                                    John Rice Jones, judge 
                                        Vanderburgh

                        Article 6. The officious and interested interference of Governor Harrison in a cause
                                    pending before the general court at 
                                        Vincennes
                                    . This was a suit instituted by Habeas Corpus for the emancipation of
                                    certain negroes, who had been arrested by Simon Vannorsdoll as agent for the heirs
                                    of John & Elizabeth Kuykendall. On a former Habeas Corpus, in which the same
                                    principles were involved, the general court discharged the negroes. And pending the
                                    second suit, during the absence of the counsel for the negroes, and before judgment
                                    was rendered, the governor by certain stratagem, finesse and cunning, outwitted one
                                    of the poor unhappy negroes, called George, as well by assuring him that the court
                                    would decide against him as by unmeaning fair collusive promises, induced the poor
                                    fellow [40] to consent to bind himself to him (the governor) for eleven years ! The
                                    suit was dismissed without a decision. In this case the governor has done an
                                    enormous injury either to the poor unhappy negroe, or to the heirs of John &
                                    Elizabeth Kuykendall And the truth of this assertion rests on this simple argument ;
                                    The negroes were free ; or they were not free; if they were free, what greater
                                    injury could the governor do a man than to deprive him of his liberty for eleven
                                    years?–And in what terms should the character of such an
                                    executive be spoken of?–If the negroes were not free why
                                    should the governor by an illicit interference prevent the heirs from a free
                                    disposition of their property ?–The case is BO plain against
                                    the governor that it does not require a comment. Witness the record of of the
                                    general court  of the Indiana Territory for

                                    , September term 1804, during the whole of the trial, and on a motion
                                    for a new trial, the governor manifested an extreme and unusual anxiety for the
                                    conviction of the prisoner ; argued the case with unbecoming warmth in the streets ;
                                    attempted to change the written opinion of [41] Judge Griffin on a plea to the
                                    jurisdiction of the court ; put himself to the trouble of searching the law for the 
                                        United States
                                     counsel, and rewarded him for the conviction of the prisoner, with the
                                    office of attorney general in the district of 
                                        Louisiana

                                    Soulard, appointed surveyor general illegal. In the month of October 1804, Governor
                                    Harrison gave to col. Soulard a written commission as surveyor general for the

                                    directing him to proceed and survey all lands claimed under grants prior to the
                                    treaty of St. Ildephonso (Oct. 1st 1800) without any restriction whatever as to
                                    floating or antidated concessions, with which the district abounds. This appointment
                                    and order of governor Harrison was made from motives of favoritism, and with a view
                                    to create prrtizans [sic], and it is believed, in direct contradiction to, and in

                        Article 10. Disgraceful inconsistent and highly dishonorable conduct as governor.
                                    About the first of November 1804, gov. Harrison promised to appoint John Dunnahow
                                    sherriff of the district of St. Genevieve and sent Mr. Menard nine miles to request
                                    him to come to St. Genevieve and recieve his commission, and after his arrival
                                    informed him that he could not have the ap- [43] pointment and gave the commission
                                    to another person. At the same time the governor made a similar promises to the
                                    friends of John Price which he violated.

                        Article 11. An illicit interference against the petitions of the people. In the month
                                    of September last, during the sitting of the general court, at 
                                        Vincennes
                                    , governor Harrison made a very extraordinary attack on the sherriff of 
                                        Randolph
                                     county, who attended the general court on business ; and from the
                                    authorative and despotic manner in which this unforseen attack was made, extorted a
                                    certificate from the sherriff, which was intended to operate against a petition of
                                    the people, in the western counties, for the division of the territory. It is
                                    believed that this conduct of governor Harrison is in direct contradiction to, and
                                    in violation of, the third article "in addition to, and amendment of, the
                                    constitution of the

                                    states, pursuant to the fifth article of the original constitution, which the said

                                    of grievances," a fertiora, the governor, a mere
                                    ministerial officer, limited and bound by the law, shall not assume that power.

                        SIR,
                        When I made a virbal communication to you of my intention to resign the commission of
                                    attorney for the 
                                        United States
                                    , which I had the honor to receive at your hand. I was impelled by
                                    various considerations, but principally by pecuniary interest–The small
                                    pittance on conviction of respondants being an inadequate compensation for the
                                    duties of that office.
                        Other considerations alone are sufficient, but they are both numerous, and immaterial
                                    with you, consequently I omit to mention them.
                        The same causes still produce the sane effect in my mind:– I therefore
                                    transmit to you this letter officially informing you of my resignation which I trust
                                    you will not hesitate to receive; & if you should not consider yourself
                                    vested with the powers of the Govern-our at this time, you will please, as
                                    Secretary, to transmit this letter to his Excellency Arthur St. Clair, that he may
                                    be informed of my resignation, and do in that behalf as to him shall seem expedient.
                        
                                    Accept my Respects.

                        Mr Breckenridge.
                        SIR, A knowledge of your patriotism and zeal manifested on many occasions in your
                                    capacity as a Representative in Congress, in supporting with manly firmness measures
                                    calculated to promote the welfare of the Republic, as well as in opposing, in the
                                    same manner, measures tending in their consequences, to tyrrany oppression and
                                    Slavery; and a firm reliance that such will be the rule and guide of your conduct in
                                    discharge of the present important duties which have devloped upon you by the voice
                                    of your Countrymen;–An anxious solicitude for the welfare of the Republic
                                    in General, and that part, in particular in which I have made a residence; Are
                                    objects of sufficient consideration with me to Solicite your attention to the
                                    present Critical Situation of that part of the Indiana Territory which bears the
                                    name of the 
                                        Illinois
                                     Country upon the 
                                        Mississippi
                                    , together with upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                    .– 
                        
                           
                              8
                                        
                                 Cincinnati, Ohio
                              , The Centinel of the
                                            North-Western Territory, April 11, 1795.
                        
                        
                        This country (I mean the western part of the Indiana Territory together with upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                    ) is an object which requires the utmost attention at the present
                                    moment. Considered as to population, this Country is respectable. The Citizens of
                                    which have never yet felt the mild operation of a republican form of Government They
                                    have always been taught to obey the voice of a Commandant. They have not yet learned
                                    that they have rights and privileges of their own, which are equal' to the rights
                                    and privileges of their Commandants and of other great men. They have always
                                    heretofore been taught, and yet believe themselves bound to obey whatever has been,
                                    or shall be commanded them by their Superiors.–It is for this reason that
                                    there are so few signers to a petition which has been sent forward to Congress,
                                    praying a division of the Indiana Territory, and for adding the Western part thereof
                                    to Upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                    , which will connect the Settlements on both sides of the 
                                        Mississippi
                                     under one and the same Government. Which is an object of the utmost
                                    importance to the people, on both sides of the 
                                        Mississippi
                                     river; as their common interest, their commercial connexion and daily
                                    intercourse with each other, furnish at once a demonstrative proof. And the division
                                    cannot by any means injure the government of the Indiana Territory nor any part of
                                    the Citizens thereof; As it is well known that there is a tract of country of 200
                                    miles between the Settlements in the 
                                        Illinois
                                     country and those in the County of 
                                        Knox
                                     on the Wabash River, at the Town of 
                                        Vincennes
                                    , where the seat of Government for the Indiana Territory is now fixed.
                                    Although this is a measure which would be productive of the greatest good to the
                                    Inhabitants of both sides of the 
                                        Mississippi
                                     River, yet there are many who have refused to Sign the petition on the
                                    Eastern bank of the 
                                        Mississippi
                                    , fearing that the measure would be detrimental to the Governor of the
                                    Indiana Territory! And however rediculous such reasonings may be in the
                                    contemplation of well informed men; yet I assure you it is the reasoning made use of
                                    there by the Creatures of the Governor of the Indiana Territory.–The
                                    people here in 
                                        Louisiana
                                     are not permitted to sign any petition to Congress untill the province
                                    shall be given up to the 
                                        United States
                                    . But, 
                        To shew the arrogance of that party in the Indiana territory, they propose using
                                    their influence in Congress to Join the whole of Upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                     to the Indiana Territory and to put the whole under the Same
                                    Constitution and Laws which are now in force in the Indiana Territory; a measure the
                                    most absurd rediculous and injurious to the people of upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                     that could possibly be immagined, and is fraught with the greatest
                                    arrogance and presumption of those who propose it. I should be sorry, indeed, Should
                                    Governor Harrison be active in this measure; for it will render him obnoxious and
                                    odious to the people of Upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                    , notwithstanding his present good understang with the Lieutenant
                                    Governor of this place. To force and oblige the people of Upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                     to go to 
                                        Vincennes
                                     the seat of Government in the Indiana Territory, whenever it might be
                                    necessary to make a communication to the Government, or to obtain a final
                                    adjudication of any Suit at Law at all Seasons of the year across the 
                                    
                                        Mississippi
                                     and through a desert of 200 miles which is rendered uninhabitable for
                                    want of wood and water; would be a grievance insupportable; and which has already
                                    been spoken of in this place with deep regret and concern. The
                                    apprehension of the people of Upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                    , of their being put under the laws and Government which now exist in
                                    the Indiana Territory, is matter of the greatest inquietude, and has filled the
                                    minds of those who reflect, with great alarm and anxiety.–And
                                    notwithstanding how desirable the measure might be of dividing the Indiana Territory
                                    by a line drawn due north from the 
                                        Wabash
                                     and St 
                                        Vincennes
                                    , running thence to lake 
                                        Michigan
                                     and the territorial line, between the 
                                        United States
                                     and 
                                        Canada
                                    , and of annexing the western part thereof to Upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                    , and of putting the whole under the Government of 
                                        Louisiana
                                    , for the mutual advantages of both parties, yet if this cannot be done
                                    without subjecting the Citizens of 
                                        Louisiana
                                     to the grievances of being subject to the laws and Government of the
                                    Indiana Territory, it will be much better for upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                     to be made a Seperate and distinct Government from the Indiana
                                    Territory and every part thereof.
                                
                        In consequence of the want of information among the Citizens of this Country (which I
                                    have already observed) it is probable that petitions will be signed and sent forward
                                    to the President and Senate, for the appointment of some designing men in the 
                                        Illinois
                                     Country East of the 
                                        Mississippi
                                     (who now occupy places sufficient to give them influence over the
                                    Ignorant and uninformed part of the people, who are, by the by, the majority) to
                                    places of the utmost importance in the Government of upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                    . We are informed that petitions have circulated on the Eastern Shore of
                                    the 
                                        Mississippi
                                     in the name of the people of upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                    , and Signed by many, and addressed to the President and Senate praying
                                    that John Edgar of Kaskaskias may be appointed Governor of upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                    .–[There is another of the same spurious kind for the
                                    appointment of Thomas Davis–I am surprised that Mr Davis has suffered
                                    it!!!–] And we are further informed that John Edgar is causing letters to
                                    be written in his name (for he is incapable of writing them himself) to several
                                    members of the Senate soliciting theiir interest in his favour. And we are further
                                    informed that one John Rice Jones, who is at present Attorney General of the Indiana
                                    Territory, and who is a kind of instrument for Governor Harrison, and therefore one
                                    of his favorites, has made pretensions, and is supported by Harrison and his
                                    influence, to be appointed one of the Judges of the Province of upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                    . John Edgar and John Rice Jones have lived at Kaskaskias for many years
                                    past, perhaps for 15 or 20 years both the one and the other; and in consequence of
                                    which are both well known to the people of Upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                    , and are both hated and detested by them–as having been the
                                    cause of the almost entire depopulation of the Town of Kaskaskias and its
                                    environs–As for John Edgar, (as I hinted before) he is a man of no
                                    information at all, nor can be be placed in any higher than the most common rank as
                                    to natural abilities; and as to education or asquired abilities he is as perfectly
                                    devoid as any country clown, you ever saw. Jones formerly wrote for him; but now
                                    there  is a young man who serves him in that
                                    capacity of a different turn of mind, and who without understanding the English
                                    language, or any other, produces nothing but bombast; as you well see by his
                                    letters, as I make no doubt but that you have seen or will shortly see some of them.
                                    Jones is a cunning fellow and capable both from natural and
                                    acquired Abilities, of overshooting the greater part of the people; he is a man of a
                                    bad character, for which reason he was not suffered to set at the Same table with
                                    Governor St Clair while the Governor was at Kaskaskias.–In fact, should
                                    both or either of these persons be appointed to any of the Offices in the Government
                                    of upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                    , it will be directly contrary to the wishes of the people of this
                                    Country (I I mean the people on both sides of the river 
                                        Mississippi
                                    ) for they are both perfectly obnoxious to the people on both sides of
                                    the river, and could not be suffered in 
                                        Louisiana
                                    . [As for Mr Davis, it is well known that he is a stranger here and
                                    altho' of sufficient abilities and capable of any Office in the Government, and how
                                    worthy soever he may be thereof, yet as he is a perfect stranger to the people, you
                                    must be sensible of the impropriety of petitioning in his favour, who is so much
                                    better known in Congress than he is here–I think that Mr Davis could not
                                    have known of the petition that was circulated in his favour, or he would have
                                    Stoped it.–] But one word for Jones –It is thought very
                                    strange by all the people that Governor Harrison has taken Jones
                                    into favour, but it must be considered, that Jones is a convenient
                                        fellow, and is ready at all times to serve the Governor in any thing he pleases.
                                        In fact he is the very humble Servant of the Governor, which is a
                                    sufficient reason.
                        I have but very little time, as I only consented last Evening, to write; and am
                                    obliged to send this letter off immediately to the Post Office in Cahokia, as the
                                    mail will be closed there this Evening. In consequence of which, and willing to give
                                    you all the information that I can, I beg leave to trouble you with a note that I
                                    made the first of January last, on the operations of the
                                    Government of the Indiana Territory; and which I intended to publish in one of the
                                    Gazettes at the City of 
                                        Washington
                                    : But in consequence of the inclemency of the season, the communication
                                    was Stoped so long that the note got out of date, and has never been sent to the
                                    press–Bat as it contains a good deal of information about the Government
                                    of the Indiana Territory, you will be so good as to accept of it, and make whatever
                                    use of it you please; In confidence, however, and without naming names.–I
                                    am sensible that the note may contain many ingrammaticistms, and may want order and
                                    Style, but I assure you that it contains the naked truth of the facts.– 
                        Altho' I have the honor to be acquainted with several members of Congress more
                                    particularly than with you, yet I hope you will pardon the intrusion, as I make the
                                    present communication to you, under a conviction that, Should you interest yourself
                                    in the support of the Division of the Indiana Territory and of adding the Western
                                    part thereof to Upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                    , &c. &c. from that convincing and persuasive eloquence
                                    of which you are known to be so great a master, I trust that you will effect the
                                    measure.–And with that prudence 
                                    which has always heretofore marked every step of your life, with the information
                                    that I have given you, you will be able to frustrate the pretensions endeavours and
                                    influence of John Edgar and John Rice Jones who aspire at the first offices of the
                                    Government of upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                    , through sinistre views and intentions.–Be pleased to drop
                                    me a line on this subject.–And believe me to be with every Sentiment of
                                    Respect and Esteem. Sir, Your most Obedient and very humble Servant

                        P.S. Should you be so good as to write, be pleased to address my letters to the
                                    Care of Post Master at Cahokia Indiana Territory.– Ut ante. I have almost
                                    forgot the English Language, since I have lived so long among the french people; for
                                    it is very seldom that I speak read or write in English, therefore you will be
                                    pleased to pardon whatever you may observe amiss in my

                        A New year's Gift to those who may be interested in the affairs of the
                                    Indiana Territory.
                        "Countries thinly inhabited are the most proper places for tyrants; wild
                                    beasts reign only in desarts." Rousseau's Social
                                        Compact. Ch. 8.– 
                        There is no condition in which man can be placed more humiliating than that of
                                    despotism. Talents and mental acquirements, learning and abilities are neglected
                                    despised and held in contempt; the apparent genius of youth is oppressed and
                                    perverted into ignorance and error; and the long catalogue of every Species of Vice
                                    and immorality Supply the places of Virtue and her happy Attendants. In this State
                                    men grow callous to the principles of plain dealing with one another; common honesty
                                    itself is hardly known; And the great majority of the people, actuated by the base
                                    principles of avarice and duplicity, seek the favour and protection of their
                                    superiors to shield them against the operation of reason and common right. Courts of
                                    Justice are degenerated into partial machines of tyranny and oppression. In all
                                    ranks of men a servile obedience, a want of candour assumes the ascendency over
                                    common sense and common honesty, insomuch, that from the Governor to the petit
                                    justice of the peace, each hath his flock of sheep in subjection to him: the
                                    subordinate officers of the government, who have the populace to deal with
                                    personally are courted and carressed by them; the Superior officers are courted and

                                     carressed by the inferior, and so on, untill
                                    one may assert, with truth, that in a despotic government, there cannot be expected,
                                    nor does there exist that best ingredient of human happiness Candour among the
                                    members who compose it.
                        Such has been the unhappy lot of the people of the Indiana Territory, for the long
                                    period of ninety or a hundred years past. They have been so long accustomed to the
                                    absolute orders if a commandant, and implicit obedience on their
                                    part, that (with but few, very few exceptions) they may be considered, at present,
                                    as the vassals or slaves of their tyrant. Nor is the abject obedience and servile
                                    attachment of these people to their tyrant, any thing more than that of a negro
                                    slave to his master: The latter obeys the commands of his master, for fear of
                                    personal correction, and the former for fear of the power of their tyrant over their
                                    property, their commissions, their future expectations, or some other similar
                                    servile consideration, which would make a free man blush with abhorence. But slaves
                                    think themselves bound to obey their masters, and the master, sensible of his power,
                                    condescends to accept the servile homage, the base prostitution of dignity and
                                    Sentiment, as nothing more than a duty that his dependents owe him, and, perhaps,
                                    will frown and maltereat them after all, which is frequently the case in this
                                    unhappy government.
                        It might be thought by strangers that these people are now some what informed with
                                    respect to their rights and privileges since the introduction of the American
                                    Government. Let them not be deceived. The operation of the government of the 
                                        United States
                                    , as it effects that Territory, is calculated to promote and encourage
                                    the same lethargy and inaction, the same Stupidity and ignorance and the same abject
                                    submission to their tryants that existed previous thereto. This may not be very
                                    intelligible without further explanation; but it will be easily understood, when the
                                    present administration shall be examined.
                        A Governor and three Judges are appointed by the general government, to rule over the
                                    people. They reside at 
                                        Vincennes
                                    . They are at one time a legislature; at another time they are a General
                                    Court; every one has his post, and all have the same post. It is a jumbled Chaos, a
                                    heterogenius body, an amphibious animal, a paradoxical machine; whose component
                                    parts are despotism artistocracy and anarchy, ludicrously fringed over with false
                                    appearances of republicanism. How public business is transacted at 
                                        Vincennes
                                    , the seat of government, where this extraordinary thing, this monster
                                    of politicks, is found, I leave to the imagination of those who may think fit to
                                    draw conclusions from it's operation in the other parts of the Territory.
                                    The machine is so calculated, that the Judges, who, in the capacity of a
                                    legislature, make the laws, do, in the capacity of a general court, interpret them.
                                    And for their ease and convenience, they have devised the means of removing from the
                                    distant counties of the Territory, almost all the suits, which are brought before
                                    the Circuit courts, to 
                                        Vincennes
                                    , where it is impossible for the complainants to prosecute; being
                                    obliged to go through a wilderness of two hundred miles, which is impassable during
                                    the winter season, on account of water and ice, 
                                    And in the Summer, for want of water. The plaintiffs, of course, are non suited, and
                                    have to pay the costs, which are no trifle in that country, where there is no such
                                    thing as a circulating medium. Upon cases of this kind, the Sheriffs in the distant
                                    counties are permitted by what is called law, to demand fees of milage, which, from
                                    the western counties on the mississippi, amount, besides other costs, to the Sheriff
                                    and other officers to about Sixteen dollars——the costs, in toto upon such a non suit, are between thirty and fifty
                                    dollars. The sheriffs in these counties, at present, think themselves little lords,
                                    and take advantage of the abuses of government, and calculate upon making their
                                    fortunes, presently, and that too with some reason; for at Kaskaskias where the
                                    courts are held for the county of 
                                        Randolph
                                     on the 
                                        Mississippi
                                    , distant two hundred miles from 
                                        Vincennes
                                    , and upwards of One hundred and twenty from fort Massac on the 
                                        Ohio
                                    , the Sheriff may well calculate on the fees of his office. But in the
                                    county of St Clair (likewise on the 
                                        Mississippi
                                    ) we shall presently See a field of the greatest abuse that, perhaps,
                                    ever existed in any government. That county includes a tract of country more than
                                    Seven hundred leagues in length, and upwards of One hundred in wedth. In that
                                    extensive country is situate the town of Michilimackinac, which is the most
                                    considerable in the county, at one extreme; and that of Cahokia, an inconsiderable
                                    village, at the other extreme. The officers of the county are appointed in Cahokia
                                    and its' vicinity, And the county courts are held in Cahokia. In this Situation, it
                                    is said, that, there is a law obliging all retailers of merchandise, to pay ten
                                    dollars a year for a license. There was a Witness produced at a court that was held
                                    at Cahokia last fall to prove that twenty odd merchants at Michilimackinac had
                                    retailed goods without paying for the license required by law. Indictments were
                                    found against them by the grand Jury, on which process were ordered, And now the
                                    Sheriff calculates on a voyage to Michilimackinac next spring which will be worth
                                    upwards of two thousand dollars in fees to him. Besides this, the Sheriff of St
                                    Clair occasionally executes process at a town on the 
                                        Mississippi
                                     known by the name of La 
                                        Prairie
                                     du chein, about three hundred leagues above Cahokia; And he executes
                                    process, frequently, as I am informed, at a town on the Illinois
                                    river about Eighty leagues above Cahokia. Upon the whole, the Sheriff of
                                    that county may reasonably calculate on a revenue of three thousand dollars a year.
                                    These circumstances alone, in a country like that, where there are so few people,
                                    and so little money, are sufficient to make every citizen curse such an
                                    administration, and with one voice, make a great effort for a change; or, abandon
                                    the government; which last is the ordinary remedy for such grievances, And which
                                    accounts for the reason of so many of our citizens removing to the Spanish
                                    territory.–In order to lessen the expenses of legal proceedings, and to
                                    bring Justice home to the citizens, would it not be conducive to their ease and
                                    convenience, and productive of their happiness, should the Governor establish courts
                                    of Justice in each of these towns, which are situate so far from
                                    Cahokia?–Yes, certainly.– 
                        But, it may be asked if these people experience so many grievances, under the present
                                    form of administration, why do they not enter into  the second grade of government and constitute a
                                    legislature, as they are entitled thereto by law?–I answer,
                                    that they have already petitioned the Governor for a legislature, and have been refused! And further, these people have been so long accustomed to
                                    obey their tyrants, that at present they know not how to resist them. And the
                                    Governor, in order to form for himself the strongest party has taken care to
                                    commission a majority of the greatest fools in the Territory, many of whom can
                                    neither read nor write, and who are thereby metamorphosed into a sett of petit
                                    tyrants: he has gone so far as to commission two, who, I am informed, was indicted
                                    some time ago for horse-stealing, in order that he might be Sure of their interest;
                                    having conferred so great a favour on those who knew themselves unworthy of
                                    it–he might well suppose the interest of that party secured. But, it will
                                    be asked, if it is true that the people have so many causes of complaint against the
                                    Governor, why have they so universally petitioned the President for his
                                    reappointment for the next three years – I answer that, the petitions
                                    were set on foot by the immediate dependents and creatures of the Governor, and
                                    presented by them to the people, to be signed, And the people were afraid to refuse,
                                    not knowing the consequences of refusing that which might possibly give Offence to
                                    their tyrant. And the same reasons may possibly actuate the Convention who are now
                                    Sitting at 
                                        Vincennes
                                    , under the immediate eye and control of the Governor, to petition for
                                    his reappointment; And I doubt not in the least but that it will be done. But the
                                    policy of the Governor, to bring about his purposes, is too evident, too glaring, to
                                    pass without observation. Knowing that his commission was soon to expire, last
                                    summer, when many persons put themselves to the trouble and expense of going from
                                    the western counties of the Territory to 
                                        Vincennes
                                    , to present their claims of land to the Governor for confirmation, he
                                    constantly refused to take their claims into consideration, saying that, he would go
                                    himself into the Western counties fcr that purpose. Accordingly, last fall, the
                                    Governor Visited the two western counties, and took in the claims of land without
                                    deciding on them, but said he would consider of them at his
                                    leisure.–During his visit to the 
                                        Illinois
                                    , he let the people know that it would be agreeable to him, if they
                                    would petition him to call a convention, under a pretence of considering the
                                    expediency of the admission of Slavery in the Territory. The people unwilling to
                                    express a disapprobation, shewed a willingness to petition the Governor to call a
                                    convention. Petitioins were made out immediately, but it took some time to get them
                                    Signed. The Governor returned to 
                                        Vincennes
                                    , and before the petitions were Sent forward he issued a proclamation
                                    authorizing elections to be holden for representatives to the convention, And at the
                                    same time his creatures presented a petition for his reappointment. In this
                                    situation the Governor had two chances of Success in his reappointment, the petition
                                    for that purpose, which the people were in some measure bound to subscribe, as their
                                    claims for lands were yet undetermined, And should that fail, the powerfull aid of a
                                    convention, which, he doubted not, would second his pretentions, seem to assure him
                                    in the government; contrary to the wishes of a great  majority of those who have thought themselves obliged
                                    to sign the petition for his reappointment: And I make no doubt but that it will be
                                    contrary to the wishes of a majority of the Convention, notwithstanding they may
                                    agree to petition in his favour, through a false delicacy, or dastardly fear of
                                    expressing their sentiments like free men. It is well, however, to observe that the
                                    petitions have not been universally Signed; nor is the convention any thing more
                                    than a very partial representation of the Territory, And chiefly composed of the
                                    creatures of the Governor.
                        Whatever might have been the President's instructions to the Governor
                                    respecting the treaty with the Indians, which was holden at 
                                        Vincennes
                                     last Summer, nothing has yet been done, respecting the indian
                                    boundaries in the 
                                        Illinois
                                     country or western counties of the Territory. I have observed in the
                                        American literary Advertiser, an extract of a letter to the
                                    editor of a 
                                        Kentucky
                                     Gazette, dated St 
                                        Vincennes
                                     Sept. 17, 1802, which reads as follows, "/ have to communicate
                                    the pleasing result of our council with the Indians. Every object
                                    for which it was holden, so far as it relates to us, is completely
                                    obtained. They listened with attention and apparent pleasure, to the plans proposed
                                    for their advancement in civilization. They all promised their
                                    firmest support in carrying the measures of the president into effect. To Governor
                                    Harrison's perseverance and unremitted attention, this successfull issue is
                                    justly to be ascribed."–I cannot believe that this was written
                                    by the Governor himself; for, I suppose, he would not have paid himself this
                                    egregious compliment: nor do I know how the egoist, who wrote, could, with any
                                    tolerable propriety, usher in the words, I, Our, without being
                                    jointly authorized with the Governor by the President, to hold the treaty. He says,
                                    "Every object for which it was holden, so far as it relates to
                                    175" (meaning the people at 
                                        Vincennes
                                    , I suppose) "is completely obtained."–For.
                                    if he meant by US, the people of the Indiana Territory, the proposition is false; as nothing has been done for the people
                                    in the 
                                        Illinois
                                    -Country on the 
                                        Mississippi
                                    . And further, it was with the utmost difficulty that the Indians
                                    consented to relinquish their right to the twenty four leagues square on the 
                                        Wabash
                                    . Besides, all the chiefs were not present, And
                                    although sent for and solicited to come, they absolutely
                                    refused!–I am astonished, indeed! that men have not more regard to
                                    truth in their public assertions!– 
                        Upon the whole, it may be observed, that from every part of the Governor's
                                    conduct in the Territory, he Seems to have evinced a disposition to retard the
                                    Settlement of the country, and even to diminish the number of it's present
                                    inhabitants. Nothing better, however, could be expected from a young man and a
                                    federalist, than that he should act in conformity to the principles of him by whose
                                    power he was first appointed to the Government. But it is earnestly-expected that
                                    our present patriotic President will seriously consider the
                                    Situation of the Indiana Territory, and check the rapid current of despotism without
                                    respect to persons.

                        Mr. Stout,
                        IN your paper of the 28th ult. I have observed with surprise, a piece in which the
                                    author has treated the citizens of 
                                        Louisiana
                                     and the American emigrants to that country, with the most unexampled
                                    calumny! and in order to render authentic this calumny, has assumed the signature of
                                        Looker-On: by which the people would be induced to believe
                                    that the writer had been an eye witness to the proceedings cf which he accuses the
                                    people of 
                                        Louisiana
                                    . If the author has been a looker on, he has certainly
                                    been very incorrect in his observations: but if, as he says, "from
                                    authentic information received, his corres-spondents have certainly deceived him. In
                                    order to take of[f] the unfavorable impressions made on the minds of the people at
                                    large, as well as on the minds of the governor and judges of the Indiana Territory,
                                    by the calumny contained in the piece signed Looker On, I beg leave to present to
                                    your readers an account of what has come to my knowledge relative to the proceedings
                                    of the citizens of the district of 
                                        Louisiana
                                     so incorrectly stated by the Looker-On.
                        I am authorised to publish to the world, from information received at st. Louis a few
                                    days ago, that it had been the intention of the citizens of Upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                     to draw up a memorial containing a statement of their local situation
                                    and interests and praying the governor and judges to enact such laws as might be
                                    thought useful and necessary for such their local situation and interests. That
                                    standing committees had been appointed peaceably to assemble in the several
                                    districts and deliberate for that purpose. That about the first of October next, it
                                    was intended that a deputation of one or two members from the committees of the
                                    several districts should assemble at st. Louis, and after the memorial should be
                                    prepared in a proper manner, to wait on the governor and judges of the Indiana
                                    Territory, (whose arrival at st. Louis they expected about that period,) not only to
                                    present the memorial or petition, but to receive and congratulate them on their
                                    arrival, with all that hospitality, ceremony and politeness which are the known
                                    characteristics of the people of that country.
                        So far from instituting or organising a systematic body, a convention to dictate to the governor and judges, the citizens of the district of 
                                        Louisiana
                                     only mean to lay before them, their own internal local situation and
                                    interests, and pray that certain laws may be enacted suitable to
                                    such their local situation. Strange construction, indeed, of the intention of a
                                    known well disposed people! Infamous calumny against an enlightened well informed,
                                    hospitable and polite people! 
                        The Looker-On accuses the citizens of 
                                        Louisiana
                                     with licentiousness; the contrary is well known to every well informed
                                    citizen of the 
                                        United States
                                    . He "hopes that the good sense of the people will point out
                                    the irregularity of their proceedings." He then says that "the
                                    Louisianians are unacquainted with our language, customs, laws and all the ordinary
                                    principles of the police of our government." Here, indeed, there appears an
                                    inconsistency in the writer: but in the latter 
                                    observation, it must be remarked, that in branding the Louisianians with ignorance, he is perfectly incorrect; for a great part of the
                                    citizens of 
                                        Louisiana
                                    , I apprehend, are much better acquainted with the things here cited
                                    than the Looker-On is himself, and are much less subject to contradictions in their
                                    writings.
                        The Looker-On "hopes rigorous exertions, will be made to
                                    prevent the calling of this projtected convention:" and says, (he seems to
                                    speak from authority,) that, "if it is persisted in, it will terminate in
                                    the shame and confusion of all the convened,', and then he says, "if the
                                    people with certain laws passed, let them petition and remonstrate, the governor and
                                    judges will be bound to attend to the remonstrances of the
                                    people." 
                        Now let me ask the Looker-On what better method of petitioning can be adopted by the
                                    people than that of assembling together either in committee or in convention (if he
                                    will have it so) thereby expressing the will not of a part, but of the whole of the
                                    people? Are not the Louisianians citizens of the 
                                        United States
                                    ? And have they not a natural right, which right is
                                    guaranteed to them in the constitution and by the treaty of cession, to assemble
                                    peaceably together and deliberate on their grievances and to petition and
                                    remonstrate for redress? 
                        The government of the 
                                        United States
                                     ought not to be understood to operate merely by the whim and caprice of
                                    the officers of administration; no, there are known laws by which they are bound,
                                    and from which they cannot depart.
                        What rigorous exertions then can be used to prevent the assembling of the people, if
                                    they think fit so to do? 
                        Strange infatuation, strange disposition, indeed! to endeavor to vilify a respectable
                                    and enlightened people, lately acquired and annexed to the 
                                        United States
                                    , who ought to be treated with all that delicacy and respect which they
                                    are so well known to merit.
                        I am indeed surprised that the anonymous scribler (I mean the Looker-On) should not
                                    have seen the great indelicacy and high impropriety of publishing his infamous libel
                                    on the citizens of 
                                        Louisiana
                                     without having first received official information from the lieutenant
                                    governor and first civil commandant of Upper 
                                        Louisiana
                                     at 
                                        St. Louis
                                    . An officer, give me leave to say, as much attached to good order and
                                    the interests of the 
                                        United States
                                     as any man; he ought to have been treated with more respect. I think
                                    the Looker-on must be an aristocrat, who wishes to prejudice the general government
                                    against the people of 
                                        Louisiana
                                     in order that a system of despotism may be established amongst them.
                        I once more pronounce, that from a considerable acquaintance with the citizens of the
                                    district of 
                                        Louisiana
                                    , I am authorised to say that it has never been the disposition of them,
                                    either in an aggregate capacity, in committee, in convention or in any other
                                    capacity whatever to dictate to the governor & judges of the Indiana
                                    Territory.
                        Enough has been said; and it is beliened that the Looker-on will  sound no more the tocsin of alarm, without having first
                                    received official information.

                        To his Excellency, JAMES MONROE, President of the 
                                        United States
                                    .
                        The undersigned persons (principally members of the bench and Bar, of 
                                        Kentucky
                                    ) beg leave to name to your Excellency, as a proper person to fill a
                                    Judicial office in one of the Territories of the 
                                        United States
                                    ; Isaac Darneille Esqr.
                        Mr Darneille, is a man of liberal education and legal acquirements: we have known him
                                    for several years past, as a practising lawyer, and the Editor of a republican
                                    print, in both of which characters he discharged his duty with credit to himself,
                                    and advantageously for his clients, and his country.
                        Mr Darneille has supported so far as we know, an irreproachable moral character; and
                                    we have no doubt, should your Excellency think proper to confer on him an
                                    appointment of this nature; the trust will be well confided.
                                
                        Mr Darneille is getting somewhat advanced in life, ‘tho’
                                    perfectly competent to perform the duties of an office of this kind; and finds it
                                    unpleasant and disagreeable to go through the turmoils which, a practising lawyer in
                                    the Western Country must necessarily encounter
                        This, together with his having been unfortunate in pecuniary matters, induces him to
                                    make this appeal.
                        Your petitioners cannot forbear saying, they will feel much gratification, if your
                                    Excellency should confer on him an appointment of a judicial nature.

            The author justly says: "This is a small book on a very large subject." One marvels
                    that he managed to say so much in so little space. He might readily have expanded paragraphs into
                    chapters. Professor Randall's distinction is based on his mastery of the period of the
                    Civil War and of the life of Abraham 
                        Lincoln
                    , and on the purpose, implicit in all his writings, to be fair to all the actors in the
                    great drama. After years of intensive study in this field, his 
                        Lincoln
                     emerges as "a towering figure," a "liberal
                    statesman," "the best friend of the South." No better choice could have
                    been made for the portrayal.of the Union President before the State University of 
                        Louisiana
                    , and with pleasure one notes that when he came to 
                        Baton Rouge
                     to deliver The Walter Lynwood Fleming Lectures in Southern History, he had a warm
                    Southern welcome.
            Having reminded his hearers of 
                        Lincoln
                    's Southern birth and connections, and devoted another lecture to his policy
                    for keeping the Border States in the Union, the author examines 
                        Lincoln
                    's "design for freedom" and his "design for
                    peace." The tragedy of his life is that he did not succeed in achieving either. He hated
                    slavery, but he must proceed within the bounds of what he conceived to be his duty. His design,
                    adhered to throughout his Presidency, was gradual liberation, colonization, compensation. The
                    emancipation proclamation actually freed very few slaves. He knew its legality was not clear. He
                    gave the seceded states a hundred days within which they might return to the Union and keep their
                    slaves; only by voluntary action should they lose them. At Hampton Roads, however, he stood for the
                    ending of slavery as a condition for the ending of the war.
            
               
                        Lincoln
                    's "design" for peace was to get the Southern states back in
                    the Union practically without penalty. Midway of the war he began work for this plan.
                    Grant's surrender terms to Lee and Sherman's to Johnston were 
                        Lincoln
                    's terms, but no state was actually restored under them. The radicals
                    controlled Congress and blocked him; they com-  pelled him, the
                    author admits, to "disclaim" his understanding with John A. 
                        Campbell
                     about recognizing the 
                        Virginia
                     legislature. His plan for peace "failed in the sense that it failed to be
                    adopted." The opposite plan "failed miserably by being adopted." 
            It's a book to read and read again; its value is in inverse ration with its size.

            Only infrequently are author and subject so appropriately fitted as in this particular instance. The
                    author attended Indiana State Teachers College as a student and later became a member of its
                    faculty. After ten years of teaching he transferred to Ball State Teachers College and later became
                    a member of the history department of Indiana University. After a lifetime of educational
                    experience, he is now a professor emeritus, his evaluation of developments is seasoned and mature
                    but not sharp. He wrote as a friend, but as a friend who could point out errors without offense.
            The history of this institution is not long nor involved but the combined record of administrators,
                    faculty, alumni, and students, with their relations to the community and the educational system of
                    the state has many ramifications. The author has realized this and has included many details that
                    often seem too minute, but the readers of the volume may think of these details as its most
                    interesting part. Probably no one will complain that any essentials have been omitted.
            The founding of the normal school in 1870 was a part of a statewide "Great
                    Awakening" in education. After three difficult years the institution appeared to be firmly
                    established. The first president, William A. Jones, placed much emphasis upon training the mind and
                    upon the factual basis of knowledge. It was fortunate that the foundations were soundly laid, but
                    President Jones made such an impression upon the institution in its formative years that future
                    adaptations to changing conditions were adopted slowly and with difficulty. The employment of former
                    students as teachers helped to maintain the original policy into the present century  Often these former students lacked advanced degrees, and, as late as
                    1928, pressure from the North Central Association of Colleges was exerted to secure faculty members
                    with more advanced graduate training.
            A college course leading to the bachelor's degree was founded in 1907 and entering students
                    were required to be high school graduates. All courses were placed upon a college plane in 1924 and
                    a graduate school was founded three years later. The state legislature gave the Normal School the
                    title "Indiana State Teachers College" in 1929 in recognition of this progress.
                    Its standards have been recognized by the accrediting agencies as of collegiate rank.
            The creation of the college course has created an interest somewhat different from the training of
                    teachers and has tended to strengthen the arts and science courses. But this has been somewhat
                    offset by emphasis upon athletics and other services which have public relations possibilities.
                    Indiana State, however, has developed conservatively and has not adopted frills and fancies.
            The present administration is to be congratulated for its wisdom in planning for this historical
                    record of the institution's past and for its choice of author. The latter is to be
                    commended for producing this useful account and for his sensible comments upon various phases of
                    educational policy.
         
         
            
               The Wilderness Road. By Robert L. Kincaid. (The American Trail
                        Series, edited by Jay Monaghan. 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Indiana, The Bobbs-Merrill Company, 1947, pp. 392. Illustrations, bibliography, and
                    index. $3.75.)
            With this delightful volume a new series is presented to readers who are interested in American
                    history. Its appeal should be strong and general, but particularly so to those drawn to the pioneer
                    days. The author's pleasant style and deep reservoir of information should stimulate all
                    who begin the work to read it to the end. It should be popular with those who are historically
                    minded, with students who seek something beyond a textbook, and with teachers and historians.
            The title and scope of the work may prove slightly confusing, for the volume is not confined to 
                        Boone
                    's Wilderness Trace, but defines the Wilderness Road as beginning at  Wadkins Ferry over the Potomac. It is surprising that Archer B.
                    Hulbert failed to devote a volume to "The Great Road" that led from 
                        Philadelphia
                     to the Yadkin River in 
                        North Carolina
                    . There was a great migration along this earlier road and the road itself has a record
                    which deserves its own historian. Kincaid in contrast to the omission of Hulbert and other
                    historians, includes a segment of "The Great Road" in his "Wilderness
                    Road," and this prevents his readers from the needed distinction between the
                    "Great Road" of the Valley of 
                        Virginia
                     and the Wilderness Trail to 
                        Kentucky
                    . Although he intriguingly narrates some of the early dramatic chapters of the former
                    and, although they form an interesting introduction to the real Wilderness Road, they do not
                    constitute an adequate treatment of the part of the 
                        Virginia
                     road which he has erroneously included.
            The author describes in his volume the history of the Wilderness Road from the beginning to the
                    present. Part one might be considered a long introduction to the second and larger part of the book
                    which describes 
                        Boone
                    's Trace in pioneer days. The battles and campaigns which centered about 
                        Cumberland
                     Gap and the old road form the third part while equally thrilling events of the
                    industrial era give substance to the final part of the volume. The subject matter of the last two
                    parts are probably less known than the events of the pioneer period.
            The professional historian will be disappointed with the citation of the author's sources of
                    information. Sometimes there are no references to support whole chapters, other times there are
                    references to an entire collection as "
                        Shelby
                     Manuscripts" or to "The manuscript collection of the author and of 
                        Lincoln
                     Memorial University. … " In a field where the sources must number
                    in the thousands, the author has referred to approximately one hundred different items. The
                    inquiring student cannot judge from these references the extent of the sources or check the
                    author's researches. The pity is that the author gives convincing evidence that he is
                    well-grounded in the literature of his subject, but does not give to his reader the benefit of this
                    knowledge.
            Minor historical faults are few and relatively unimportant. The author accepts the
                    "regulator" tradition about the settlement of eastern 
                        Tennessee
                     (p. 93). A thorough knowledge of the history of the "Great Road" and
                    the routes  through the Carolina mountains, should have created
                    doubts at least. The statement about the Kentuckians "demanding" representation in
                    the 
                        Virginia
                     assembly seems a little strong (pp. 128–129) .
            The volume gives a modern and highly interesting account of the Wilderness Road which was so
                    important in the settlement of the 
                        Ohio
                     Valley. It is nicely printed, excellently proof-read, and attractively bound. It should
                    be widely read.

            The 
                        Chicago
                     Fire of October, 1871, stands out as an awesome and a significant event in that
                    city's history. The extent of the devastation to this commercial metropolis of the Midwest
                    is reflected in the statistics dealing with loss of lives and property, as well as in the
                    pessimistic accounts left by men and women who survived the holocaust. This pessimism which attended
                    the initial shock of the disaster proved temporary, and soon was followed by the optimism of
                    reconstruction. Such a resilient spirit was but one of the many manifestations of a growing city
                    that had unbounded confidence in a great future.
            In his brief introductory remarks Angle mentions the grim warnings of a succession of fires which
                    immediately preceded the Great Fire. The author's description of the rapid manner in which
                    the fire spread over the entire city area is accompanied by appropriate references to well-known
                    streets and buildings. Anyone acquainted with the city of 
                        Chicago
                     is able to orient himself as regards the progress of the fire in its various stages.
                    The human side of the story is revealed in seven descriptive letters. All but one of these
                    eyewitness accounts were written soon after the fire.
            In view of the fact that numerous contemporary accounts of the Great 
                        Chicago
                     Fire have been written, Angle's  task has
                    been one of selection. In many respects, the seven letters included in this small volume represent
                    but one reaction repeated seven times. There is no indication of the psychological effect of the
                    fire upon the very rich and the very poor. The reactions of a common laborer to the calamity of 1871
                    could have furnished an interesting contrast.
            This attractively bound volume contains reproductions of commercial notices and of proclamations
                    issued by the mayor following the crisis, as well as photographs of well-known 
                        Chicago
                     landmarks as they appeared before and after the fire. Mention should also be made of
                    the appropriate lithographs which preface the letters. These lithographs are the work of Joseph
                    Trautwein and possess definite carica-tural value. Angle's judicious footnoting serves as
                    an indispensable guide in acquainting the reader with people and places mentioned in the letters.
                    Anyone desiring a souvenir book on the Great 
                        Chicago
                     Fire will be interested in this volume.

            It may be a testimonial to our present world-mindedness that the titles chosen for these recent
                    books, dealing with such widely separated subjects, are so nearly identical and so international. At
                    any rate, this observation of the fact that such distant places as 
                        Florida
                     and 
                        Minnesota
                     were linked together at various times in their histories under the banners of
                            
                  France, Spain
               , Great Britain, and the 
                        United States
                     successively, pays tribute to the imperial vision of yesteryears. In this pennant
                    chase, 
                        Florida
                     edges out 
                        Minnesota
                     5–4, only by virtue of having joined the Confederate states of America for a
                    brief sojourn under the Stars and Bars.
            The 
                        Minnesota
                     booklet is an excellent recapitulation of the state's usually checkered
                    territorial history. Its fifteen  maps show, with remarkable
                    simplicity and clarity, 
                        Minnesota
                    's position under her four flags, and for good measure, her vicissitudes as a
                    possession of the 
                        United States
                    . It is a saga of dismemberment, for rarely between the year when she ceased to be a
                    small corner of New 
                        France
                     (1763) and that in which she became a sovereign state (1858), did 
                        Minnesota
                     exist as even a part of a single unit. Denizens of the Gopher state should know these
                    interesting facts about their homeland and should be duly grateful to the generous citizen of 
                        St. Paul
                     whose gift enabled the historical society to publish them in such an attractive manner.
            Although Patrick's book is more pretentious than the 
                        Minnesota
                     pamphlet, it is likewise written in celebration of his state's centennial and
                    for the same kind of popular circulation. The deliberate effort to write a comprehensive history
                    that the tired business man can cover in one evening has resulted in a somewhat disappointing book.
                    Excessive condensation blurs the style and excludes such colorful figures as Alexander McGillivray
                    and William Bowles, to say nothing of semi-legendary pirates from the sixteenth to the twentieth
                    century. 
                        Florida
                    's tangled border problems, the complicated diplomacy in which she was
                    constantly involved until 1819, the still more complicated land grant imbroglio inherited from the
                    Spanish regime and the welter of reconstruction policies are all dealt with so slightly as to leave
                    the reader barely conscious of their existence. These were undoubtedly intentional sacrifices to the
                    worthy cause of writing a readable story, as was the omission of footnotes and a bibliography. Such
                    brevity, both in text and appendices, makes it impossible for a reviewer to detect the use or disuse
                    of such monographs in this field as those of Fuller, Whitaker, Sieber, Foreman, and W. W. Davis.
            The author, however, shuns the temptation to eliminate economics in favor of romance. His brief but
                    sharply etched analyses of such factors as shifting population centers, the small role actually
                    played by plantation economy and the essentially frontier character of the peninsula's
                    post-reconstruction development are among the best parts of his book. His last two chapters,
                    presenting one of the few integrated accounts of 
                        Florida
                    's amazing history since 1920, go far to justify the publication of the entire
                    work. In spite of the appealing nature of the subject, histories of 
                        Florida
                     are not  numerous. This one should be welcomed by
                    those for whom it was specifically intended and it will furnish them with all the useful information
                    on the subject that they will need.

                        Dear Members of the History Department:
                        The Indiana History Teachers Association has had an annual meeting in 
                                        Indianapolis
                                    , for many years, during December, at the Indiana History Conference
                                    sponsored by the Indiana Historical So-city, Society of Indiana Pioneers, and the
                                    Indiana Historical Bureau. The date has been the Friday and Saturday nearest
                                    December 11. The history teachers' program consists of a morning and a luncheon
                                    session on Saturday. But all other meetings are open to the teachers.
                        Those teachers who have attended have found the programs interesting, challenging,
                                    and helpful. Fellowship with other teachers has been stimulating, also.
                        But those who have been in charge of the program have found it embarrassing to beg
                                    busy people to journey to 
                                        Indianapolis
                                     and present papers that have taken hours of research, without being
                                    able, often, to pay even their expenses. You see, our organization has existed on
                                    good will instead of adequate dues.
                        Other organizations of prestige, civic and professional, are supported by state dues.
                                    Won't you teachers of the college, high school, and elementary history
                                    departments please make our professional organization one of which you can be
                                    increasingly proud!
                        Teachers in high school and elementary departments depend upon teachers in the
                                    college departments for their training. They, in turn, depend upon an interested,
                                    efficient core in high school and grades to make history, civics, and economics
                                    function in the lives of our future citizens. Without an intelligent, informed
                                    citizenry democracy cannot last. Is it not vital, especially in this critical
                                    period, that we work together toward creating such a public?
                        With this object in mind the teachers attending the December, 1946, meeting adopted
                                    the following motion:
                        "The Indiana History Teachers Association shall have an annual fee of three
                                    dollars which shall include a yearly subscription to the Indiana
                                        Magazine of History. This in turn will include membership in the Indiana
                                    Historical Society, entitling each member of the History Teachers Association to one
                                    copy each of the Publications of the Historical Society."
                        
                        Such material will prove invaluable to the teacher of history, civics, or economics.
                                    You have only to go through some of the recent magazines and publications to be sure
                                    of that.
                        Won't you join the Indiana History Teachers Association, enjoy the Publications of the Historical Society, and come to our annual
                                    meetings?
                        To make the December, 1947 meeting outstanding, the program committee needs to know
                                    now what finances it can count on. So I am asking you to please send your dues
                                    ($3.00) to Mr. Hartwell A. Key-ler, Howe High School, 
                                        Indianapolis
                                    . Mr. Kayler will send two dollars to the Historical Society and keep
                                    one dollar for the organization. Or, if you desire, send two dollars directly to:
                        Indiana Historical Society 408 State Library and Historical Building 
                                        Indianapolis
                                     4, Indiana and one dollar to Mr. Kayler.
                        If you are now a member of the Historical Society and have paid your next
                                    year's dues, then please send one dollar to Mr. Kayler.
                        I sincerely hope that your response to this appeal will be 100%, and I
                                    trust that I shall see all of you at the meeting in December.
