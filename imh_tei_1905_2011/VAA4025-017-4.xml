            <p>The opening of the eighteenth century marked the beginning of the struggle between the English and
                    the French for control of the <geogName>Mississippi valley</geogName>. The French had extended their
                    posts the whole length of the river, but the English were threatening their hold by advancing upon
                    the headwaters of the great rivers flowing westward from the Alleghanies. The Carolinians had

                    and together these red-men and whites had enslaved other Indians who still had to rely upon their

                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Iberville wrote shortly after 1700 concerning the English:
                            "II y a plusiers années qu'ils se sont placés aux

                            joined (?) the Chickasaws whom they armed with guns, with whom they joined and made
                            incursions on the other nations which they enslaved. He added that the English had gone
                            north to the thirty-seventh parallel and south to the thirty-third and descended the Mobile [<placeName>

                    the forerunner of larger movements of the English from across the mountains.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> In
                    the English colonies, he argued, population was already so dense that it must find an outlet to the
                    west. The newcomers would naturally settle along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and ally themselves with the Indians whose lands they were invading.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> If this should take place, the English would be in a position to cut the communication
                    between <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>

                    </placeName> and threaten the integrity of the French colonial empire.</p>
            <p>Iberville furthermore pointed out that the <hi rend="i">coureurs du bois,</hi> who had come down to
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    </placeName> to trade, were already selling their furs to the English, whose posts were only three
                    or four hundred leagues away and could be reached without portage. To break up this trade, Iberville
                    proposed drastic measures. At one time he suggested closing all the routes leading from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> country to the English posts.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> At another time he proposed to send
                    an army to destroy the English colonies and thus end their encroachments.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> He
                    would then establish a post on the "Ouabache" and compel the Indians to trade
                    there or go to <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Iberville's urgings apparently received no consideration and nothing was done for nearly a
                    quarter of a century. Frenchmen of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> were to write memorials in regard to the coveted country while Canadians and English
                    were fighting for its possession. Iberville had known that the country was rich in furs, and he
                    thought that tanneries there would prove profitable. He thought also that lead mines could be worked
                    to advantage.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are other descriptions of the country in the years following 1700 still more attractive than
                    Iberville's. One writer added to the unlimited supply of furs and to the wealthy mines an
                    extremely fertile soil. He described the woods as full of wild apples from which could be made
                    excellent cider.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> He too feared that the English would seek to obtain the
                    country and urged the construction of a post to bar them from descending the rivers. Yet another
                    writer urged that a post on the "Ouabache" would be valuable for supplying the
                    other posts of <placeName>

                    </placeName> post and apparently his recommendations were looked upon with favor. It appears that he
                    had already obtained sanction to start a post in this region, for in 1725 he wrote that he had
                    delayed its construction for fear of not having enough merchandise to carry on a trade with the
                    Indians. He declared at the same time that the small garrison maintained by Vaudreuil on the upper <placeName>

                    </placeName> (near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ft. Wayne</settlement>

                    this post that there were a number of French families already settled on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> who needed protection.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> These settlers traded directly with the

                    of making <hi rend="i">2</hi> decision. In May, 1725, it asked the governor of <placeName>
                        <country>New France</country>
                    </placeName> to take measures to keep foreign traders out of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> at once. His efforts were hastened by the information that the Dutch from <placeName>

                    </placeName> had established posts on the upper <placeName>

                    was not of a kind to attract the Indians, Boisbrilliant feared that the newcomers would get most of

            <p>Boisbrilliant's report regarding English activities probably stirred the Company of the

                    </placeName> country was not yet occupied by any nation of Europe; but that if the English should
                    establish themselves on any of the great rivers of this country, they could not only threaten the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>

                    considerations the company urged that the post should be established in the country of the Miamis.

            <p>The new post was to be manned by ten soldiers and two officers. The company allowed 300 livres for
                    construction of the fort and 1,170 livres for the subsistence of the men during the first year. It
                    also allowed 800 livres for presents to the Indians. The pay of the soldiers and other expenses
                    brought the total allowance for the year up to 3,230 livres.</p>
            <p>Perier objected to the smallness of the company's allowance. He wrote that labor was high
                    and that it would cost 600 instead of 300 livres to build a suitable fort. He declared also that for
                    presents to the Indians not less than 3,000 livres should be set aside. He promised to go ahead with
                    the project, however, and informed the company that he would leave the selection of a site for the

                            pais qu'ils occupent. La seconde, que quand ce fort seroit bien solide et
                            appuyé par les Miamis au bord de la Rivière de Ouabache, non seulement
                            cette disposition n'empecheroit pas les Anglois de S'Btablir sur celle des
                            trois Rivières en question qu'ils jugeroient à propos; mais
                            encore Elle leur en procureroit les moyens, parce que n'y aiant plus de sauvages
                            dans le haut des Rivières qui pussent s'oposer a leurs desseins ils
                            pourroient si fortifier, s'extendre, et se mettre en Etat de tomber tout

                            this fort cannot sustain itself except by the aid of the savage Miamis, and it Is not likely
                            that we can persuade them to come, settle In a place so far from the country which they
                            occupy. Second, when this fort will be very solid and supported by the Miamis on the banks
                            of the <placeName>

                            these three rivers in question which they will justly judge, but still it will procure for
                            them the means, because no longer having the savages at the source of the rivers which
                            opposes their plans, they can fortify, extend, and place themselves In a position

            <p>In the spring of 1733 war broke out between the French and the Chickasaws. These Indians had long

            <p>With an army of Frenchmen and Choctaws, Bienville planned to march north. D'artaguiette with

                    his Miamis and a small band of Iroquois, were to march south. The rendezvous was fixed for Ecors a

                    village which they had discovered some distance from the main camp. If they could capture enough
                    provisions, they declared, they would then be willing to await the arrival of Bienville.</p>
            <p>D'Artaguiette agreed to this and on the night of March 24, the party stole to within a short
                    distance of the village. Early the next morning the French and Indians made their attack. The fight
                    had hardly started when four or five hundred Chickasaws came to the rescue of the village. The

                    suitable place for the new post. In 1740 the location had not yet been decided upon, but Bienville

                    inundation. Bienville suspected that Canadian traders were responsible for their objections<hi rend="sup">94</hi> which put an end to his schemes.</p>
            <p>In 1743 Vaudreuil succeeded Bienville as governor of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. He planned at once to send traders among all the Indian nations of his province and to
                    do all in his power to make the fur trade flourish. He hoped by this means to increase French
                    influence among the Indians, and thus to weaken the English. Another and very important part of his
                    plan was to establish a fort on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

               <hi rend="sup">96</hi> Vaudreuil further hoped to add to these tribes the Shawnee who, he wrote, had

                            General Gage, September 18, 1772 (0. O. 5, 90, 265). As already noted, there were about
                            seventy grants of land made by St. Ange. An enclosure with the letter of General Gage to
                            Hillsborough dated January 6, 1769, stated that at "St Vincents on the Ouabache

                    They possessed ten negro slaves and seventeen Indian slaves. They had two hundred and sixty head of
                    horses, two hundred and ninety-five hogs, and'nearly a thousand head of cattle. Their grain
                    in the field was estimated at more than ten thousand bushels, and their tobacco at 36,360 pounds.
                    They were also provided with three mills.<hi rend="sup">113</hi>

                    their land titles were derived from the French king while he reigned over the country, and that they
                    were protected by the treaty of peace. They furthermore denied all the charges that Gage had made

            <p>Gage was apparently impressed by the reply of the inhabitants of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, for he wrote to Dartmouth that he could not "venture to decide whether they
                    are People settled under legal Titles or Strollers who have taken Land without authority."
                    He believed that there might be some of both kinds.<hi rend="sup">118</hi>

                    and held it for several years. A statement to Haldemand in 1774 was signed by Pertheille

            <p>The author of this little journal, Dr. Samuel Bernard Judah, was born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1777, and was the son of Samuel Judah, the immigrant, who, coming from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> about 1760, was a leading merchant of <placeName>

                    </placeName> thereafter. This first Samuel Judah is mentioned in the <hi rend="i">Jewish
                        Encyclopedia</hi> as an ardent supporter of the American Revolution, to which indeed he devoted
                    the greater part of a not inconsiderable fortune. The only recompense he ever received for this was
                    a personal letter of thanks and appreciation from George Washington, and that also was afterwards
                    lost in a fire.</p>
            <p>Dr. Judah lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York city</settlement>
                    </placeName> all his life except a few years spent at <placeName>

                            Brunswick</region>, <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
               </placeName>, where
                    his son Samuel Judah (later of Indiana) was a student at Rutgers college. This last named Samuel
                    Judah graduated from college in 1816, studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1818, and shortly
                    thereafter made his way to Indiana, locating in 1819 at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, then one of the most important towns in the state. By 1827 Samuel Judah had made for
                    himself a professional reputation throughout the southern and central parts of the state, and for
                    two years had been married. To visit his son was the principal object of Dr. Judah's trip.</p>
            <p>The traveller was no longer young, physically rather delicate, and accustomed to what are called the
                    comforts of life. One is amazed at his acceptance of rigors and hardships of travel which would
                    appal and exhaust a strong man of today.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> was written solely for the use of the writer himself, for future
                    reference, statistics and recollections, without any thought of form or care to avoid repetition.</p>
            <p>The only interest that these notes con now claim is as data of a long journey into our own west
                    nearly a century ago; and as a description of life and conditions that happened to attract the
                    writer's rather discursive attention. And it contains here and there personal touches
                    disclosing the distinctive qualities of "types" whom the writer met, as well as
                    something of the sophisticated attitude of an elderly city-man for the first time in a new country.</p>

                                    and carried a pack on his back. On stopping at the Tavern I spoke to him and offered
                                    him a drink, commending his spirit in walking. He declined and took a seat in the

                                    miles along the <geogName>Lake Shore</geogName> to this place. A fine bridge owned
                                    by Rufus S. Reed, who receives toll. Here we took post coaches and at 9 p. m.
                                    arrived at Freedonia 3 miles from Dunkirk on <geogName>Lake Erie</geogName>. Baptist

                        <p>This being Sunday I went with Mrs. Brandon to the Methodist Meeting. 25 women, 18
                                    men–considering all things it was pretty good. A raw young countryman
                                    exhorted–bad singing. Mr. Perrin, the Presbyterian preacher, said to be
                                    good. The people here are generally more on the moral order than given to priest
                                    craft; ministers are not much encouraged.</p>
                        <p>Nov. 20th–Winter has commenced very early here. Indian Summer is ended.</p>
                        <p>Nov. 21st–Fine morning–bright sun, but very cold. Flour
                                    $2.00 cwt, corn 10c bushel–cows $6–Beech

                                    Children are fed on mush &amp; milk, economy is the custom. People are generally
                                    poorly clad–many blacks, poor miserable race. So much can be raised that
                                    the people in general labor but little. They have a great dnal of pride.</p>

                        <p>Was introduced to a lawyer, General Johnson–not a military

                                    summer pantaloons, shabby clothes &amp; a cloak to hide all.</p>
                        <p>Though Whisky is drunk like water, considering the large population of <placeName>

                                    by the quart &amp; even the wealthy prefer it to any of the foreign liquors.
                                    Orchards and fruits are abundant. The apples about <placeName>

                        <p>I have been makeing up my accounts. I spent 13^ days on the way when not
                                    traveling–delayed by storms &amp; alterations of stage-days, viewing

                                    Generally I have ridden until 10 or 11 o'clock at night:–often
                                    up by 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning–but had only 2 whole

                        <p>Nov. 24th–It seems that the prevailing desire in the Western States is to
                                    have land, rather than money, tho land is very cheap. Yet I do not think a man of

                                    at Samuel's is very good, tho, they have too much of

                                    to be everything but an M.D. He returned to Ky. with his horse &amp; gig, and I
                                    saw him no more. At <placeName>

                                    trials–1 for theft and 1 for assault &amp; Battery. Mr De Young and
                                    Miss Joseph were married on the 21st. I called on them–Cakes &amp;
                                    wine. They gave me a packet of Bridescake to be delivered to Piexotto at <placeName>

                                    Dunn's silver spoons. Had a very agreeable day &amp; at 5 p. m. went on
                                    board the Fairy again, &amp; at 6:15 we bade adieu to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, with 11 new cabin passengers, 3 of them ladies &amp; I
                                    don't know haw many deck passengers–Played a rubber of whist,
                                    Fine evening.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 1st–Most of the Kentuckians are gamblers. The Ken-tuckians generally
                                    seem full of cash. Seven of the passengers played at cards till 1 a. m. Most of the
                                    passengers are Jack-sonians. In the night one of the Deck passengers made off with
                                    the boat. We stopped at Limestone, the proper name of which is
                                    Maysville–pretty town.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 2d–Got up at 6 O'clock–found the men unloading 40
                                    tons of lead on to the bank at <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city">Portsmouth</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                           </placeName>. The boat being now light we go faster. 11 a. m. stopped
                                    to repair one of the wheels. Went ashore &amp; walked–After an hour
                                    the repair being made, we proceeded. 6 p. m. passed mouth of the <geogName>Big Sandy
                                        River</geogName>. At 9 we overtook the steamer <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                                    </placeName> aground. She left <placeName>

                                    </placeName> 2 days before us. We took her passengers.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 3rd–Cloudy morning–<geogName>Big Kanawha
                                    River</geogName>–Coal mines. We have dragged on bottom several times.
                                    Moonlight night–Unwell.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 4th–Rainy &amp; disagreeable–I am better, Views on the
                                    River are beautiful. The Indian name <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> signifies beautiful stream &amp; it deserves this title. It is a
                                    grand and novel sight for one who had no idea of the western States to hourly see
                                    boats ascending &amp; descending the inland river–besides the <pb n="351" id="VAA4025-017-4-041"/> great number of flat or keeled boats loaded
                                    with produce for <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. In the east it would be considered a dangerous navigation, but nothing
                                    is thought of it here, tho many strikes sawyers &amp; sink &amp; great loss
                                    is sustained. This trade gives employment to hundreds of men. These flatboatmen
                                    return up the river in steamboats as deck passengers which costs them nothing. Deck
                                    passengers are required to help loading &amp; unloading. Ten years ago the
                                    flatboatmen returned on foot &amp; experienced great hardships. Case is now
                                    altered. The advancement of the West is surprising. Happy people; all they want is
                                    the ambition of the East–Too little labor.</p>
                        <p>The morning fogs are very disagreeable, &amp; unless you take some liquor you
                                    feel the effects. Of course, say the people of the west whisky, is the first of all
                                    good. I have not however, seen an habitual drunkard, tho whisky is drunk like water.

                            </placeName> who fought under Pontiac. The son, who was a man of fine parts and magnificent
                            presence, and was one of Tecumseh's Lieutenants, fought by his side when he was
                            killed at the battle of Thames. Becoming incensed at the treatment of the Indian allies by
                            the British commander, he with Sauganash transferred their allegiance to the Americans.
                            Joining the Potawatomi, among whom he married, he was chosen peace chief of the tribe, and
                            was their spokesman at the council with the representatives of the Government at <placeName>

                            service for the. white pioneers, time and again saving the settlements from destruction by
                            timely warnings. When the Winnebago rose in 1827 he visited the Potawatomi villages to
                            dissuade them from taking up arms, and at the village on <geogName>Geneva Lake</geogName>, <placeName>

                            friend he encountered the ill will of a large part of the Indians, but his influence over
                            his own tribe was sufficient to restrain it from joining in a body of forces of Black Hawk,
                            who twice went to Shabonee in person and tried to enlist him in his cause. Shabonee held his
                            tribe and remained true to the whites. As a council of the allied tribes in February 1832,
                            Shabonee espoused the cause of the whites and endeavored to convince Black Hawk that his
                            proposed uprising would only bring disaster to the Indians. Unsuccessful in his endeavor, he

                            reward for his services. At the solicitation of his tribe he joined them again, but pined
                            for civilization, and in 1855 again returned to find that speculators had bought his two

                    their land, and they played false to their red brethern and yet lost all. They are now surrounded
                    and will be crushed. The whites will shortly have all their lands and they will be driven away.</p>
            <p>In every talk to the Indians, General Harrison said: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>There was truth and justice in all that talk. The Indians with me would not listen to it. It was
                    dictating to them. They wanted to dictate to him. They had counted his soldiers, and looked at them
                    with contempt. Our young men said: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            warriors. Their hands are soft. Their faces are white. One half of them are calico peddlers.
                            The other half can only shoot squirrels. They cannot stand before men. They will all run
                            when we make a noise in the night like wild cats fighting for their young. We will fight for

            <p>Such were the opinions and arguments of our warriors. They did not appreciate the great strength of
                    the white men. I knew their great war chief, and some of his young men. He was a good man, very soft
                    in his words to his red children, as he called us; and that made some of our men with hot heads mad.
                    I listened to his soft words, but I looked into his eyes. They were full of fire. I knew that they

                    sleeping in its way. I, too, counted his men. I was one of the scouts that watched all their march
                    up the river from Vin-cennes. I knew that we were like these bushes–very many. They were
                    like these trees; here and there one. But I knew too, when a great tree falls, it crushes many
                    little ones. I saw some of the men shoot squirrels, as they rode along, and I said, the Indians have
                    no such guns. These men will kill us as far as they can see. "They cannot see in the
                    night," said our men who were determined to fight. So I held my tongue. I saw that all of
                    our war chiefs were hot for battle with the white men. But they told General Harrison that they only
                    wanted peace. They wanted him to come up into their country and show their people how strong he was,
                    and then they would all be willing to make a treaty and smoke the great pipe together. This was what
                    he came for. He did not intend to fight the Indians. They had deceived him. Yet he was wary. He was
                    a great war chief. Every night he picked his camping ground and set his sentinels all around, as
                    though he expected we would attack him in the dark. We should have done so before we did, if it had
                    not been for this precaution. Some of our people taunted him for this, and pretended to be angry
                    that he should distrust them, for they still talked of their willingness to treat, as soon as they
                    could get all the people. This is part of our way of making war. So the white army marched further
                    and further into our country, unsuspicious, I think, of our treachery. In one thing we were
                    deceived. We expected that the white warriors would come up on the south bank of the river, and then
                    we could parley with them; but they crossed far down the river and came on this side, right up to
                    the great Indian town that Elskatawwa had gathered at the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>. In the meantime he had sent three chiefs down on the south side to meet the army and
                    stop it with a talk until he could get the warriors ready. Tecumseh had told the Indians not to
                    fight, but when he was away, they took some scalps, and General Harrison demanded that we should
                    give up our men as murders, to be punished.</p>
            <p>Tecumseh had spent months in traveling all over the country around <geogName>Lake
                    Michigan</geogName>, making great talks to all the warriors, to get them to join him in his great
                    designs upon the palefaces. <pb n="356" id="VAA4025-017-4-046"/> His enmity was the most bitter of
                    any Indian I ever knew. He was not one of our nation, he was a Shawnee. His father was a great
                    warrior. His mother came from the country where there is no snow, near the great water that is salt.
                    His father was treacherously killed by a white man before Tecumseh was born, and his mother taught
                    him, while he sucked, to hate all white men, and when he grew big enough to be ranked as a warrior
                    she used to go with him every year to his father's grave and make him swear that he would
                    never cease to make war upon the Americans. To this end he used all his power of strategy, skill and
                    cunning, both with white men and red. He had very much big talk. He was not at the battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>. If he had been there it would not have been fought. It was too soon. It frustrated all
                    his plans</p>
            <p>Elskatawwa was Tecumseh's older brother. He was a great medicine. He talked much to the
                    Indians and told them what had happened. He told much truth, but some things that he had told did
                    not come to pass. He was called "The Prophet." Your people knew him only by that
                    name. He was very cunning, but he was not so great a warrior as his brother, and he could not so
                    well control the young warriors who were determined to fight.</p>
            <p>Perhaps your people do not know that the battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> was the work of white men who came from <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and urged us to make war. Two of them who wore red coatss were at the
                    Prophet's Town the day that your army came. It was they who urged Elskatawwa to fight. They
                    dressed themselves like Indians, to show us how to fight. They did not know our mode. We wanted to
                    attack at midnight. They wanted to wait till daylight. The battle commenced before either party was
                    ready, because one of your sentinels discovered one of our warriors, who had undertaken to creep
                    into your camp and kill the great chief where he slept. The Prophet said if that was done we should
                    kill all the rest or they would run away. He promised us a horseload of scalps, and a gun for every
                    warrior, and many horses. The men that were to crawl upon their bellies into camp were seen in the
                    grass by a white man who had eyes like an owl, and he fired and hit his mark. The Indian was not
                    brave. He cried out. He should have lain still and died. Then the other men fired. The other Indians
                        <pb n="357" id="VAA4025-017-4-047"/> were fools. They jumped up out of the grass and yelled.
                    They believed what had been told them, that a white man would run at a noise made in the night. Then
                    many Indians who had crept very close so as to be ready to take scalps when the white men ran, all
                    yelled like wolves, wild cats and screech owls; but it did not make the white men run.</p>
            <p>They jumped right up from their sleep with guns in their hands and sent a shower of bullets at every
                    spot where they heard a noise. They could not see "us. We could see them, for they had
                    fires. Whether we were ready or not we had to fight now for the battle was begun. We were still sure
                    that we should win. The Prophet had told us that we could not be defeated. We did not rush in among
                    your men because of the fires. Directly the men ran away from some of the fires, and a few foolish
                    Indians went into the light and were killed. One <placeName>

                    whom I knew very well– he was a great hunter who could shoot a tin cup from another
                    man's head–put up his gun to shoot the <placeName>

                    so that I could not see my aim. Then I heard the gun and saw the <geogName>Delaware fall</geogName>.
                    I thought he was dead. The white man thought so, too, and ran to him with his knife. He wanted a <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> jumped up and ran away. He had only lost an ear. A dozen bullets were fired at the
                    white man while he was at the fire, but he shook them off like an old buffalo bull.</p>
            <p>Our people were more surprised than yours. The fight had been begun too soon. They were not all
                    ready. The plan was to creep up through the wet land where horses could not run, upon one side of
                    the camp, and on the other through a creek and steep bank covered with bushes, so as to be ready to
                    use the tomahawk upon the sleeping men as soon as their chief was killed. The Indians thought white
                    men who had marched all day would sleep. They found them awake.</p>
            <p>The Prophet had sent word to General Harrison that day that the Indians were all peaceable, that they
                    did not want to fight, that he might lie down and sleep, and they would treat with their white
                    brothers in the morning and bury the hatchet. But the white men did not believe.</p>
            <pb n="358" id="VAA4025-017-4-048"/>
            <p>In one minute from the time the first gun was fired I saw a great war chief mount his horse and begin
                    to talk loud. The fires were put out and we could not tell where to shoot, except one one side of
                    the camp, and from there the white soldiers ran, but we did not succeed as the Prophet told us that
                    we would, in scaring the whole army so that all the men would run and hide in the grass like young
                    quails.</p>
            <p>I never saw men fight with more courage than these did after it began to grow light. The battle was
                    lost to us by an accident, or rather by two.</p>
            <p>A hundred warriors had been picked out during the night for this desperate service, and in the great
                    council-house the Prophet had instructed them how to crawl like snakes through the grass and strike
                    the sentinels; and if they failed in that, then they were to rush forward boldly and kill the great
                    war chief of the whites, and if they did not do this the Great Spirit, he said, had told him that
                    the battle would be hopelessly lost. This the Indians all believed.</p>
            <p>If the one that was first discovered and shot had died like a brave, without a groan, the sentinel
                    would have thought that he was mistaken, and it would have been more favorable than before for the
                    Indians. The alarm having been made, the others followed Elskatawwa's orders, which were,
                    in case of discovery, so as to prevent the secret movement, they should make a great yell as a
                    signal for the general attack. Ail iof the warriors had been instructed to creep up to the camp
                    through the tall grass during the night, so close that when the great signal was given, the yell
                    would be so loud and frightful that the whole of the whites would run for the thick woods up the
                    creek, and that side was left open for this purpose.</p>
            <p>"You will, then," said the Prophet, "have possession of their camp and all
                    its equipage, and you can shoot the men with their own guns from every tree. But above all else you
                    must kill the great chief."</p>
            <p>It was expected that this could be easily done by those who were allotted to rush into camp in the
                    confusion of the first attack. It was a great mistake of the Prophet's red-coated advisers,
                    to defer this attack until morning. It would have succeeded when the fires were brighter in the
                    night. Then they could not have been put out.</p>
            <pb n="359" id="VAA4025-017-4-049"/>
            <p>I was one of the spies that had dogged the steps of the army to give the Prophet information every
                    day. I saw all the arrangement of the camp. It was not made where the Indians wanted it. The place
                    was very bad for the attack. But it was not that which caused the failure. It was because General
                    Harrison changed horses. He had ridden a grey one every day on the march, and he could have been
                    shot twenty times by scouts that were hiding along the route. That was not what was wanted, until
                    the army got to a place where it could be all wiped out. That time had now come, and the hundred
                    braves were to rush in and shoot the "Big chief on a white horse," and then fall
                    back to a safer place.</p>
            <p>This order was fully obeyed, but we soon found to our terrible dismay that the "Big chief on
                    a white horse" that was killed was not General Harrison. He had mounted a dark horse. I
                    know this, for I was so near that I saw him, and I knew him as well as I knew my own brother.</p>
            <p>I think that I could then have shot him, but I could not lift my gun. The Great Spirit held it down.
                    I knew then that the great white chief was not to be killed, and I knew that the red men were
                    doomed.</p>
            <p>As soon as daylight came our warriors saw that the Prophet's grand plan had
                    failed–that the great white chief was alive riding fearlessly among his troops in spite
                    of bullets, and their hearts melted.</p>
            <p>After that the Indians fought to save themselves, not to crush the whites. It was a terrible defeat.
                    Our men all scattered and tried to get away. The white horsemen chased them and cut them down with
                    long knives. We carried off a few wounded prisoners in the first attack, but nearly all the dead lay
                    unscalped, and some of them lay thus till the next year when another army came to bury them.</p>
            <p>Our women and children were in the town only a mile from the battle-field waiting for victory and its
                    spoils. They wanted white prisoners. The Prophet had promised that every squaw of any note should
                    have one of the white warriors to use as her slave, or to treat as she pleased.</p>
            <p>Oh how these women were disappointed! Instead of slaves ahd spoils of the white men coming into town
                    with the rising sun, their town was in flames and women and children were <pb n="360" id="VAA4025-017-4-050"/> hunted like wolves and killed by hundreds or driven into the river and
                    swamps to hide.</p>
            <p>With the smoke of that town and the loss of that battle I lost all hope of the red men being able to
                    stop the whites.</p>
            <p>I fought that day by the side of an old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ottawa</settlement>
                    </placeName> chief and his son, the brother of my wife. We were in the advance party, and several of
                    those nearest to me fell by the bullets or blows of two horsemen who appeared to be proof against
                    our guns. At length one of these two men killed the young man and wounded the old chief, and at the
                    same time I brought him and his horse to the ground. The horse ran, before he fell, down the bluff
                    into the creek, quite out of the way of the whites. The man's leg was broken and he had
                    another bad wound. I could have taken his scalp easily, but Sabaqua, the old chief, begged me not to
                    kill him. He wanted to take him to his wife alive, in place of her son whom the white brave had
                    killed.</p>
            <p>I was willing enough to do this for I always respected a brave man, and this one was, beside, the
                    handsomest white man I had ever seen. I knew him as soon as I saw him closely. I had seen him
                    before. I went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> only one moon before the battle as a spy. I told the governor that I came for peace.
                    This young man was there and I talked with him. He was not one of the warriors but had come because
                    he was a great brave. He had told me, laughingly, that he would come to see me at my wigwam. I
                    thought now that he should do it. I caught a horse–there were plenty of them that had
                    lost their riders–and mounted the white brave with Sabaqua behind him to hold him on and
                    started them off north. I was then sure that we should all have to run that way as soon as it was
                    light. The Indians were defeated. The great barrier was broken. It was my last fight. I put my body
                    in the way. It was strong then, but it was not strong enough to stop the white men. They pushed it
                    aside as I do this stick. I have never seen the place since where we fought that night. My heart was
                    very big then. Tecumseh had filled it with gall. It has been empty ever since.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This chieftain was in <placeName>

                    </placeName> or <placeName>

                    </placeName> at the time of the battle and knew nothing of it or its results until late in the
                    winter. He did not meet with the success that he had hoped for upon his mission and he returned sad
                    and dispirited with the little body-guard that accompanied him on his trip south. He crossed the
                        <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> near Shawneetown and kept up the edge of the Grand prairie, thus
                    avoiding all the settlements on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. Opposite the point where the river bends eastward from its general north and south
                    course, the party struck off east and crossed over to the south side of the river to visit some
                    friends at Shawnee prairie. [He crossed the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName> at the
                        <geogName>Baltimore hill</geogName>, north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Covington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, at what is now known as the Bend.]</p>
            <p>It was night when they crossed the army trail, or Tecumseh would have read in it the explanation why
                    he did not find his friends where he expected to meet them. He thought that for some reason the
                    Prophet had called in the scattering families, concentrating them around his town. He did not dream
                    of the great disaster that had fallen upon that town. He did not look about him the next day with
                    the usual sagacity of an Indian, who reads a long history in a few little signs such as a white man
                    might pass unnoticed. He arrived after dark in the evening on the site of the Prophet's
                    town, without having met a single soul to give him any information. His heart had begun to misgive
                    him. How it must have sank down to the zero of despair when he neither saw a light nor heard one
                    sound of life, where but a few months before he had left such a stirring community.</p>
            <p>"In a single moment," as he afterward told Shobonier, "I realized that I
                    was a ruined man. My mission to my mother's native land and her brothers had failed. I
                    could not induce them to come where the water turns to stone and the rain comes from the clouds in
                    showers of white wool and buries every green thing out of sight. I had shut my eyes all the way so
                    as not to see the beautiful country that would soon be trampled under the feet of the hated white
                    men. I was going from a sunny clime to one of ice and snow, and I thought that although it might lie
                    deep and cold upon the roof of my wigwarn, <pb n="362" id="VAA4025-017-4-052"/> I should find a warm
                    fire within. And that thought kept me warm through all the. chilly nights of that long journey. If I
                    was hungry, I said I can bear it, for I know that my people on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> have plenty of corn, and my friends, the English, give them great stores of cloth,
                    blankets, guns and powder for their furs. But when I came to this land of plenty and looked for my
                    warm home and my young wife to welcome me, I heard no voice and saw nothing but darkness. Then my
                    heart was black. I knew at once the cause of all this desolation. I saw the marks of the great white
                    general that I had defied in his own council house, in every blackened brand of the burned town. I
                    stood upon the ashes of my own home, where my own wigwam had sent up its fire to the Great Spirit,
                    and there I summoned the spirits of the braves who had fallen in their vain attempt to protect their
                    homes from the grasping invader, and as I snuffed up the smell of their blood from the ground I
                    swore once more eternal hatred–the hatred of an avenger. I am now going to strike these
                    foes. Will my red brethren go with me?"</p>
            <p>A few went, not all, for the charm that had held them fast to the great chief was broken. He might
                    swear vengeance over his ruined wigwam and all the homes of his people, but he could not wipe out
                    the blood of that battle-field, nor heal the festering wounds of a hundred disabled warriors. Nor
                    could he regain his lost prestige. If in a single moment he realized that he was a ruined man, he
                    continued to realize it all his life.</p>
            <p>He no longer declared that Elskatawwa was a Prophet and possessed of supernatural powers and
                    knowledge. He called him by a most degrading epithet, that means far more than
                    "fool."</p>
            <p>The next summer after the battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, war was declared between the <placeName>

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, and then Tecumseh appeared in a new character–a brigadier general in the
                    British service, and commander-in-chief of all the Indian allies of that power. He fought a severe
                    battle at Fort Meigs, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, May 5, 1812, and another, perfectly desperate, at the Moravian Towns, on the

                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, in the Autumn of 1813, where he laid down his life fighting for his country, and to
                    avenge wrongs which he felt had been inflicted upon him by the Americans.</p>
            <pb n="363" id="VAA4025-017-4-053"/>
            <p>He was still a young man at the time of his death, strong and hearty, well-formed in body, limb and

                    </placeName> historical society, was chairman of the committee on arrangements, and no detail had
                    been overlooked to make the meeting an interesting one, both from the standpoint of the program and
                    from the standpoint of entertainment to the numerous visitors. <placeName>

                    </placeName> only recently dedicated its new courthouse, a model from the architectural standpoint,
                    in which the historical society meeting was held.</p>
            <p>Judge John E. Iglehart, president of the society, made a talk in which he outlined the nature of the
                    historical work being conducted by the eight counties in southwestern Indiana. He laid special
                    emphasis on the importance of compiling the biographical history of the early leaders in that
                    section of the state. A paper on "Old Gilead Church and the Rev. Charles Polk" was
                    read by Thomas J. de la Hunt of <placeName>

                    </placeName> During the Fifties." An outline of the historical work that is being conducted
                    throughout the state was presented by John W. Oliver, and the "pocket counties"
                    were urged to take the lead in this special work, which the Indiana historical commission is now
                    promoting.</p>
            <p>Following the historical program, the visitors were tendered a pioneer reception by Mr. and Mrs. A.

            <p>The Indiana historical commission was specifically authorized by the last session of the state

                    in the movement to erect markers and tablets on historic sites and spots in Indiana, Representatives
                    of several organizations interested in preserving local history, and in marking historic sites, were
                    called together in the office of the Historical commission on Friday afternoon, September 30, and a
                    definite program was agreed upon which will be followed throughout the state. The Historical
                    commission will issue a bulletin within the near future which will give, county by county, a list of
                    all historic sites and spots within the state that have been marked. This is only a preliminary step
                    to the larger campaign that will be inaugurated throughout the state, calling attention to the
                    numerous sites and spots that should be designated by appropriate markers. The Historical commission
                    will co-operate with each community in the work of selecting sites and spots of historical value,
                    and will advise with the local committees in charge as to the nature of the tablet, boulder or
                    monument that should be used in designing the local historical event.</p>

            <p>The Indiana Historical commission, co-operating with the division of geology of the department of
                    conservation, is conducting an archeological and historical survey of Indiana, county by county.
                    Blue print maps of each county are being prepared and a special questionnaire issued by the two
                    departments are supplied to the counties which undertake the survey. Included in the archeological
                    list of material will be found a reference to mounds, earthworks, enclosures, specimens and
                    collections, descriptions of which are to be given as to size, shape and state of preservation. The
                    exact location is to be noted and charts, pictures and drawings are to be made of the mounds and of
                    the remains. Also the earliest settlements within the county, sites of historic buildings, old
                    cemeteries, boundary lines, birthplaces of noted people, markers, old trails, trade routes, and
                    other points of historical interest will be designated on the map. The historical material called
                    for includes a list of old books, diaries, ledgers, letters, newspapers, historic documents,
                    pamphlets, and other sources of <pb n="368" id="VAA4025-017-4-058"/> state and local history. It
                    will require two or three, or even perhaps four, years to complete the survey of the entire state,
                    but when the counties have made a careful examination of their historical and archeological
                    material, Indiana will then be in possession of the first and only systematic survey that has been
                    made of its rich archeological remains and historical records. The survey has already been started

                    Little Turtle used this place for protection and stored his supplies there. Another theory is that
                    the massacre of LeBalme, an early French cavalry officer who served with the American army occurred
                    here in 1780. LeBalme and his followers were on their way to <placeName>

                    erected a Lincoln centennial log cabin in the city park, and the logs used in the cabin were first

                    Canyon Club picnic held in the McCormick's Creek state park. At that meeting sixteen of
                    those present signified their willingness to become members of a society organized for the purpose
                    of collecting and preserving local history. Mr. 0. E. Dunn, a descendant of the second settled in

                    R. L. Beem, was appointed. It is the purpose of the society to increase this committee by adding one
                    member from each township. A program was planned for the next meeting to be held at the home of Mrs.
                    Louise Cochrane, October 28.</p>

                    reminiscences, the singing of old-time songs, the reading of papers appropriate to such a theme, and
                    a picnic dinner. An exhibit of gowns, manuscripts and other articles of historical interest was
                    arranged in addition to the exhibits already housed in the building. A representative and
                    enthusiastic audience, in which all parts of the county were represented, filled the rooms of the
                    building to over-flowing. The home of the society is owned by the county, and is the only home so
                    owned in the state. As a centennial memorial of real value to the work of the historical society in
                    the future, a member of the county council of <placeName>

            <p>Under the direction of the Indiana historical commission many of the counties in the state have
                    prepared and published a comprehensive history of the part their citizens played in the World war.
                    The county war history committees include in their reports records of the men who entered service, a
                    report of the activities of the county council of defense, the selective service boards, the liberty
                    loan drives, the Red Cross work and all other organizations that actively participated in war work.
                    More than 60 of the 92 counties have completed their work, and the other 32 counties are expected to
                    prepare their reports within the next year.</p>

            <p>Major David I. McCormick, superintendent of the Indiana Battle Flag commission, has completed a
                    catalogue of the flags in the state house. These flags were carried by Indiana organizations in the
                    Mexican, Civil and Spanish American wars. There are 166 national colors and 142 regimental colors,
                    81 of which have been incased and are on exhibit on the fourth floor of the state house. The
                    remaining flags have been stored carefully in the basement. It is hoped that all may be on exhibit
                    at some time in the proposed War Memorial building. Major McCormick is now making a search for any
                    flags which still remain in private hands. Also he is getting from the contemporary newspapers and
                    from the soldiers themselves any stories which relate to particular flags.</p>

                    which contains the minutes of the meetings of the Indiana chapter of the D. A. R. from 1901 to date.</p>

                    30 and 31, 1921. Dr. Frank B. Wynn, representing the Indiana historical commission, read a paper in
                    which he traced the growth of the church from the date of its first meeting in a rude log cabin,
                    erected on the spot near where the state house now stands, on down to the present day. Church
                    centennials are occurring with increasing frequency throughout Indiana, and the history of these
                    religious institutions adds much to the state's collection of historical material.</p>

                    subject of Indiana history than did Mr. Holliday. It was he who rescued from the possessions of John
                    B. Dillon, after the latter's death, the journals of John Tipton, one of the rarest
                    historical documents in our state archives. Mr. Holliday was the first to publish these journals. He
                    was long a member of the Indiana historical society, the chief sponsor of the society of Indiana
                    pioneers, as well as its president, up until the time of his death. As editor of the <placeName>

                    new items possessing historical interest. Many of the historical feature articles which he sponsored
                    in the newspapers of which he was the editor have since found their way into the historical

                    board of accounts, has found a law applying to Indiana, when it was only a territory, that made a
                    man working on a road liable to a fine of $1 if he should halt a stranger on the highway
                    and ask him for a drink.</p>

            <p>Mr. Pence, after 3,000 hours of work on his own time, has just completed what is now an extraordinary
                    exhibit in the State library. It consists of ninety-two volumes written in long hand and indexing
                    the laws specifically applicable to counties from territorial times to 1852 when the present
                    constitution was adopted. In those days the legislature enacted all kinds of special laws providing
                    how specific and individual things should be done in counties. For instance, Mr. Pence found where
                    the legislature authorized about 100 couples to obtain divorces. But nowhere did he find a law so
                    destructive of the personal rights of a liberty loving people as the one prohibiting a man working
                    on the road on a hot, dusty day from stopping a galloping traveler to ask:</p>

            <p>This volume is made up of two parts; the first consisting of six lectures delivered by Judge David D.
                    Banta, on successive Foundation days from 1889–1894. These have previously been published
                    in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Alumni Quarterly,</hi> beginning with the first issue of the magazine,
                    January, 1914. The second part is an account of the series of addresses delivered at the Centennial
                    Educational conference, held at Indiana university, May 5–7, 1920, including the address
                    delivered by <pb n="386" id="VAA4025-017-4-078"/> Jacob G. Schurman on Foundation day, January 20,
                    1920, together with an account of the Centennial commencement. The first one hundred pages of the
                    volume deal with the growth and early development of the university, from its beginning in 1820,
                    through its transformation into the Universtiy (1832–1838), and the final safeguarding of
                    its endowment by a constitutional provision in 1850. The first period of the university was the
                    seminary, 1820-'28. As early as 1816 an act of congress provided for a "seminary
                    of learning" and the many difficulties in obtaining professors, and the trials of the few
                    students are related. In 1828 by a legislative enactment the seminary was raised to the dignity of a
                    college to meet the needs of a growing community. After a few months of anxiety on the part of the
                    founders of the college, Dr. Andrew Wylie accepted the presidency. The fourth lecture is concerned
                    with the "Faculty War of 1832," which finally resulted in the employment of a
                    number of new professors. The fifth lecture deals with the last stages of transformation, by which
                    the college became the university. The sixth and last lecture in the first part of the volume,
                    explains the changes brought about by President Wylie. All of the lectures are written in an
                    entertaining style, containing personal references to former professors and anecdotes of interest to
                    students and graduates of the school. The first address in the second part is "The American
                    University: Today and Tomorrow," by J. G. Schurman. Although a scholarly discourse, setting
                    forth the highest ideals of a university, it contains too much of the idea of a selective training
                    for the exceptional. Of the eleven addresses published, which were delivered at the Educational
                    conference, one of the most clear-cut and suggestive was, "The University and its Service
                    to Business," by Evans Woolen. He sets forth the main purpose of the State university as
                    follows: first, to train men of character to think, and second, to develop in them a habit of work.
                    Other papers in this volume are: "Researches on Spirocleacta Pallida," by Aldred
                    S. Warthin; "The University Medical School and the State," by A. S. Warthin;

                        <country reg="mnu">Minnesota</country>
                    </placeName> Plan," by Elisa P. Lyon; "The Thomas Jefferson Theory of
                    Education," by Samuel M. Ralston; "The State University at the Opening <pb n="387" id="VAA4025-017-4-079"/> of the Twentieth Century," by Edward A. Birge; "The
                    Functions of the State University," by Paul Shorey; "The Obligation of the State
                    toward Scientific Research," by Roscoe Pound; "A Present Need in American
                    Professional Education," by Robert A. Millikan; "Spiritual Frontiersmen,"
                    by Francis J. McConnell and "The Spiritual Ideal of the University," by Sir Robert
                    Alexander Falconer. This latter part of the volume, unlike the first, deals with topics of general
                    interest, outlining the broad underlying principles of the relations of a State university to such
                    professions as law, medicine and business. The last fifty pages of the book give a detailed account
                    of the Centennial commencement, written by Ivy L. Chamness. It closes with a fitting address by
                    Doctor Bryan to the Senior class. It is scarcely conceivable that such a valuable volume, the only
                    one of its kind published by the university, should have neither title page, nor index. The paper is
                    poor and the binding worse.</p>

            <p>The text was written by Alfred Kiyana some seven years ago for Dr. Boas and by him placed in the
                    Berlin Museum of Ethnology. It was translated into English by Horace Poweshiek and has been
                    corrected by the editor, Mr. Michelson. Both the original and the translation are printed, in
                    parallel columns. Those interested in the Fox language will find the text one of the best sources of
                    that language extant.</p>
            <p>The text starts out with a description of how the gens festival is conducted; it will be noticed that
                    there is mostly dancing and smoking of the Catlinite pipe which every one
                    uses–"even a child, or a woman is given a smoke–all maidens, little
                    girls, men, youths, boys." After the word "o'no id tci" was
                    pronounced all conversation ceases and all sit quietly. One reads an account of the winter festival
                    at which time there is dancing and the bones are taken and "thrown at the foot of an oak
                    tree on the north side where no sunlight will strike."</p>
            <p>In a brief description of the ceremony preceding a war party, we read of the various war songs,
                    dances, their eating and their medicinal and wailing songs.</p>
            <p>The proceedings of the warrior, who is now on the warpath, is given; the marvelous powers of the
                    medicine in the sacred pack in causing death, and the effect that the flute has upon the enemy who
                    "would be unable to move" are recorded. "The heads of the enemy would
                    continue to be cut off while they were still alive." If the enemy made a sudden assault, or
                    if the enemy is attempting escape, instructions are given: wide rivers can be made narrow and again
                    wide by the mystic powers hidden in the sacred pack.</p>
            <pb n="389" id="VAA4025-017-4-081"/>
            <p>Now as to what happened to the one blessed. It is said that "Black Rainbow" was his
                    name. And his niece was named "Deer-Horn" so it is said. They were both blessed
                    together. An account of their meeting the owl is given and we read of the blessings which the owl
                    bestowed upon "Black Rainbow:" he will be able to wade a deep and wide river, and
                    if any one is wounded he will be able to heal them. Elaborate explanations came next. The one
                    blessed will "instruct those who will take care of the sacred pack in the future."</p>
            <p>A gens festival is held. The virtue of the sacred pack is revealed by those who had poor eyesight and
                    they were made to have good eyesight. And those who had various diseases were led around in a circle
                    four times. After they had been led around four times they were healed. More elaborate instructions
                    followed.</p>
            <p>Black-Rainbow and his niece Deer-Horn were captured by the Sioux. Black-Rainbow used his power upon
                    them making them beat his drum. Many a Sioux came. All were captured. All were killed but one woman
                    who was sent home to tell the story of this capture. A captured Sioux warrior was sent home to
                    narrate the same story. The last episode is the turning to granite of both Black-Rainbow and
                    Deer-Horn.</p>

            <p>This is a fresh book. When one reads in a textbook on <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history without finding long chapters on Puritanism and Slavery he has a right to be
                    surprised. Still more remarkable there is more about Edward K. Collins in this text than about
                    Daniel Webster; a portrait of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName> but none of Calhoun. There is a chapter of 20 pages on the Civil War and one of 34
                    pages on Prices and Wages. On the other hand the title <hi rend="i">Economic History</hi> is
                    misleading. There are no technical discussions of economic theory, but a plain story of the people
                    at work. The book is a first class antidote to our present airy, idealistic moral fashion in history
                    without being offensively materialistic. The author divides his subjects into six parts, indicating
                    six periods in our development: the colonial period (to 1763), the New Nation (to 1819), the
                    American System (to 1840), occupation of the west (to 1873), large scale production and competition
                    (to 1893), industrial combination and government regulation. The period since 1873 covered by the
                    last two sections of the text is the most troublesome to the teacher of American history. The author
                    has stated his facts acceptably and described conditions fairly, and avoided dogmatic interpretation
                    on his own part. He very wisely refrains from telling us what the long industrial struggle means and
                    offers no nostrums. The text is well-made and beautifully illustrated. It seems as a school text it
                    will be preferable to the old style politico-military text. At any rate it seems a relief to be free
                    of glory, grandeur and moral platitudes and get down to the ground.</p>

            <p>This is a memorial volume by the secretary of the Filson Club. It is unnecessary to say it is a

                    his haunts, houses, fancies and friends. His life, occupying about 100 pages, is told by letters,
                    clippings and reminiscences of his associates. Pages 167–329 contain his <pb n="393" id="VAA4025-017-4-085"/> letters, the chapter being headed A Posthumous Autobiography. Pages
                    340–353 contain reviews of his books. Pages 353–454 contain reminiscences by a
                    score or so of his friends. The last 90 pages contain a list of his books–36 volumes of
                    poetry, 6 brochures and 8 prose sketches–an index to his books, bibliographical
                    references and an index.</p>

                    </placeName>. Here, also, the poet lived till his death, December 8, 1914. There is no serious
                    effort on the part of the author to estimate Mr. Cawein's work. The critics had given him a
                    place in the first rank of American poets before his death. Before his death, 1907, <hi rend="i">The

                    author, always interested in art herself, has encouraged the art movement in the state for years.
                    She was state art chairman of the Indiana federation of women's clubs for some time and at
                    present is director of prints in the general federation of women's clubs. Although well
                    qualified to handle the subject critically, she has preferred to treat it historically. As stated in
                    the preface: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The present work is the gathering together of material that will be helpful to the future
                            historian, of things accomplished by the artists who have lived and hoped and struggled in
                            Indiana. No attempt has been made to give a critical analysis of motifs or technique. The
                            artists of Indiana belong to the future, not to the past. Time will prove the value of their
                            work, and coming generations may condemn or approve.</p>

            <p>The author has included in the work many interesting incidents and biographical notes which give it
                    character and atmosphere.</p>

            <p>Probably the most useful part of the book is the addenda of eighty-nine pages. This includes an
                    alphabetical <hi rend="i">Who's Who</hi> in art, giving brief biographies of over three
                    hundred Indiana painters, sculptors and illustrators; the names of Indiana illustrators; the names
                    of Indiana designers of bookplates; a list of Indiana art schools, art associations, and art clubs;
                    the names of the painters of the portraits of the governors of Indiana; a list of Indiana monuments
                    and markers, including where possible the name of the sculptor; and a bibliography of Indiana
                    artists. This part of the book is a veritable dictionary of Indiana art and will be a joy to all
                    Indiana librarians. A durable cloth binding and quite a complete index make the book especially
                    valuable for reference purposes.</p>
            <p>The work contains eighty-one full page well chosen illustrations, a number of which are familiar to
                    those who visit the art collections in the state. Others are reproductions of pictures in private
                    homes and collections outside of Indiana.</p>
            <p>It is a satisfaction to be able to recommend such a useful and complete piece of work to those
                    interested in this subject. It would be of use in all art libraries in the country, in the larger
                    reference libraries, and of course in every public library in Indiana.</p>
