        <p>The experience of these reporters has determined the impracticability of making just
          parliamentary reports of the Proceedings and Debates of the Legislature in connection with
          the Daily newspaper press. Their experience has also determined that the work itself is
          practicable, desirable, valuable; and they think too that it is neither a difficult nor a
          desirable job. They have been working through thirteen volumes without the protection of
          copyright, and from this it is plain enough that the price they have received for the
          BREVIER does not invite competition. Their suggestions in the last volume as to the
          continuance of these Reports have not been entertained by the legislative mind, and need
          not be repeated. They say now that the BREVIER is a failure without the positive
          sustaining hand of the State; and because that hand has not been extended to these
          reporters, they accept it as notice to quit work with the regular session of the body they
          are serving.</p>

            George W. Friedley, the President of the recent special session, took the chair and
            announced that the proceedings would be opened with prayer by Dr. Black, Pastor of the

            <p> Mr. Dwiggins, in order to ascertain if there be a quorum present, demanded a call of
              the Senate.</p>
            <p>The President directed Mr. D. H. Olive, the Principal Secretary of the last session,
              to act as clerk in calling the vote. This service having been performed,</p>
            <p>The President announced that there was but twenty-six senators present.</p>
            <p>The following Senators answered to their names on roll call: From the county of
              Allen, Ochmig Bird; from the counties of Adams and Allen, John D. Sarnighausen; from

              Robert Dwiggins; from the counties of Putnam and Hendricks, Addison Daggy; from the

              H. Clay Gooding; from the county of Vigo, Henry D. Scott, from the counties of Merrick

            <p>Mr. Glessner moved for an adjournment till two o'clock P. M., as there was no quorum

            <p>Mr. Dittemore and another Senator near him demanded the yeas and nays, and the same

              <head rend="center">THE ORGANIZATION.</head>
              <p>Mr. Gooding moved a call of the Senate. This order being executed, answers were

              <p>The yeas and nays were demanded by Messrs. Dittemore and Bird.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown. I rise to a point of order. Senators have no right to call the yeas and
                nays until after the body is organized. This body is not acting under any rule. We
                are but trying to organize.</p>
              <pb n="18" xml:id="VAA8558-14-018"/>
              <p>Mr. Dittemore (in his seat.) Trying to organize?</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown. Yes sir, trying to organize. The Constitution provides that 34 members
                shall constitute a quorum to do business, though a smaller number may meet and
                adjourn from day to day and compell the attendance of absent members. That all has
                reference to proceeding after the body has been organized. The calling of the yeas
                and nays is a matter provided for by the body after it has been organized. The
                calling of the yeas and nays is a matter a party has the right to have done by
                reason if some law or rule governing an organized body. But where there is no
                organized body there is no law or rule governing it at all. The Senate is not
                organized but is in process of organization. It is seen that there are not enough
                persons here to organize. The next question is: What is to be done? It is to adjourn
                to give persons belonging to the Senate an opportunity to come in and participate in
                the organization. Calling the yeas and nays, making motions to lay on the table and
                the introduction of bills and resolutions are all in the category provided for by
                rules and regulations applicable to and governing an organized body. There is no
                such thing here, and for that reason nobody has the right to call the yeas and nays;
                and all that can be done is to adjourn.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams. I will call the attention of the Chair to the 2nd rule. "Nine
                Senators, with the President or ten in his absence, having chosen the President pro
                tem shall be authorized to call a Senate, compel the attendance of absent Senators,
                make an order for their fine or censure, and may adjourn." special session.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gooding suggested - These are rules of the</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams. True, of course; but it is common sense, and that ought to govern
                till we have rules.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown. I hate to lock arms with so good a parliamentarian as the Senator from
                Knox (Mr. Williams) who is always so earnest and sincere. But I am constrained to
                doubt his sincerity a little to-day. The rule which he read refers to an organized
                body that had adopted it for its government. Now, if the body was organized, and had
                adopted this rule as one of a series for its government, then if the Senators from
                Knox, Owen, Allen and several others should absent themselves, why nine Senators
                with the presiding officer would have power to send for them and compel their
                attendance, because then they would be authorized to do that by a rule of an
                organized body. In the absence of a rule for it, there is no authority to call the
                yeas and nays, and nothing could be done but to adjourn from day to day.</p>
              <p>Mr. Slater suggested, if we have a President pro tem., we have an organized
                body.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dittemore. I take this position under the second rule, that if there is a
                disposition not to send for absentees, that there is a sufficient nnmber of members
                present to enforce the rule: and that is to proceed to elect a pro tem, and send for
                absent members; and I desire to make the motion that we proceed at once to elect a
                President pro tem.</p>
              <p>The President. The motion is out of orderthere is already a motion pending.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwigging. The question is upon the right of Senators to call the yeas and nays.
                There is not, perhaps, a Senator on this floor, except the Senator from Knox, who
                will insist that these rules are the rules of this Senate. This Senate has adopted
                no rules, and the only thing we can be guided by at this stage is the constitution
                of the State. The eleventh section of article four provides as follows: "Two-thirds
                of each House shall constitute a quorum to do business; but a smaller number may
                meet, adjourn from day to day, and compel the attendance of absent members. A quorum
                being in attendance, if either House shall fail to effect an organization within the
                first five days thereafter, the members of the House so failing shall be entitled to
                no compensation, from the end of the said five days, until an organization shall
                have been effected."</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown - I rise to this point of order, that this assemblage here this afternoon
                is irregular. We have no business here. If we do our duty we will take our hats and
                leave. The Senators not here have more sense than we. The Constitution says:
                "two-thirds of each House shall constitute a quorum, to do business; but a smaller
                number may meet, adjourn from day to day, and compel the attendance of absent
                members. A smaller number met this morning; a less number than a quorum was here;
                and the record shows it. An adjournment was made, and the record shows it; and the
                Constitution says that adjournment is from day to day; and that carries it over till
                to-morrow.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins. That is the point I was about making. [Laughter.] As I was proceeding
                to remark, the only legitimate argument that can be drawn from the latter part of
                the constitutional provision is that when there is less than thirty-six Senators
                present, we can only adjourn from day to day. I say all that can be done is to meet
                once on each day and order the call of the Senatorial Districts of the State, and if
                less than thirty-six Senators respond, all they can do is to adjourn till
                to-morrow.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner. The Senator from Jasper [Mr. Dwiggins] has been discussing what we
                can do with reference to an adjournment. I understand the question to be as to
                whether Senators can demand the yeas and nays on a motion to adjourn.</p>
              <p>The President. That is the question before the Senate.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins. If I have not satisfied the Senator from Shelby, [Mr. Glessner] that
                this can not be done, I am sorry. It seems to me that it is the duty of the
                President pro tem of the last Senate as soon as the call of the Senatorial districts
                has been had and there is found to be no quorum present, to announce that there is
                not 36 Senators present and he can not proceed with the organization of the Senate
                and therefore declare the Senate adjourned till tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Mr. Slater. I will ask if it would not be in order to move that the absentees be
                sent for?</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins. There is no power to compel their attendance until we have a quorum.
                Show me authority under the constitution by which we can place a Senator under
                arrest. Who is the officer of the Senate to issue, the warrant? or where is the
                sergeant-at-arms to execute that warrant?</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams. We are either Senators, or we are not Senators. Why we are called by
                counties I can not understand. I presume there will be no order to swear in Senators
                this session for there are none but what have been sworn in. If there is no
                organization, why did the President take the chair? Now, if we have the right to go
                on and do business, and I think we have. I think we have the right to have Senators
                called by their names. I don't think the Chair will order a Judge of the Court to
                swear us in; and I <pb n="19" xml:id="VAA8558-14-019"/> think we have the right to
                call for the yeas and nays on a motion to adjourn, or on any other question; and I
                think we have the right to close the doors and send for absentees.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner. There has been a motion made to adjourn, and the yeas and nays being
                called for. A point of order was made, that a minority of the members present could
                not call the yeas and nays, and for the reason that the body is not organized - that
                we have no rules by which this body could be adjourned.</p>
              <p>We all understand that the action of this body or of any other body, in the absence
                of other special rules, is governed by the recognized parliamentary usages. We have
                met to-day under the Constitution with a view of organizing the Senate and
                proceeding to business. On examination of the Constitution we find that there is
                less than a quorum present. All we can do, therefore, is to meet and adjourn over
                from day to day, or send for absent members. Now in the absense of standing rules we
                are governed by the recognized parliamentary usages. If so we have the right to have
                the yeas and nays called, and we have the right to direct the manner in which the
                call is to be taken. If we are not organized, a majority of the members present can
                determine in what way the oath can be taken. Therefore, when we demand the yeas and
                nays shall be taken, the presiding officer, or the person occupying the chair,
                should allow himself to be directed in what way to put the vole in the absence of
                specific rules. Therefore, I say that when a question is put we have the right to
                say as to whether we shall have the yeas and nays called or not.</p>
              <p>Then, as to the question raised by the gentleman from Jasper (Mr. Dwiggins), and
                also the Senator from Jackson (Mr. Brown), that under the constitution, in the
                absence of a quorum, nothing can be done but to adjourn from day to day, except to
                send for absent members. The Senate met this morning, and the adjournment went till
                two o'clock this afternoon. Under the constitution, even construing it strictly, may
                we not meet in the morning and adjourn to the afternoon, and then to the next
                day?and would not that be adjourning from day to day under the constitution?</p>
              <p>It will not be controverted that it has been the usage from time out of mind, in
                the absence of a quorum, to submit the question to the body as to what moment it
                will adjourn. It has been the usage of the Legislature of Indiana, and, I presume it
                has been the usage of the Legislature of Indiana, and, I presume, in all other
                bodies, to submit the question to the body as to what moment it will adjourn.
                Therefore, the joint made by the gentleman from Jasper is no point at all. The idea
                that a presiding officer has any right over the voice of the majority, although no
                quorum may be present, to declare this body adjourned, can not be recognized. With
                that view I think we have the right to make a motion to adjourn, and that it ought
                to be entertained ; and when the yeas and nays are demanded, especially by a
                majority of the body, the question of adjournment should be determined in accordance
                with the directions so made by the body.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott. I am in doubt whether anybody knows that there are any Senators here or
                not. I never heard of this body or the one in the other end of the Capitol being
                sworn before doing business. And I doubt whether we have any right to be. I may be
                right or I may be wrong on the question of swearing.</p>
              <p>Mr. Harvey. I find, in looking over the list, that there are some four or five or
                more Republicans now in the city and not in their seats, which has the appearance of
                a disposition on their part to break a quorum.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott. I understand that until a quorum answer to their names upon a call by
                the Clerk, the Senate can do no business, because it is not an organized body. It is
                nothing. Suppose they never come? What is the remedy? The Governor must order an
                election from the districts where parties do not appear, and you can't put your
                finger upon a law that will compel a man to come here who has not appeared at this
                session.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams read from Jefferson's Manual authority for a less number than a quorum
                to send the Sergeant-at-Arms, or any other person or persons, for absent members. He
                asked Mr. Brown: Has not Marion county got two Senators?</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown. Yes, sir.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams. They are not here.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown. I can't help that.</p>
              <p>The President. The Chair is of the opinion that it is not in order to demand the
                yeas and nays at this time. The motion to adjourn was rejected by a viva voce
                vote.Mr. Brown demanded a call of the Senate.</p>
              <p>The President directed a call by counties and districts.</p>
              <p>It was taken, and - </p>
              <p>Mr. Neff, from the county of Randolph, and Mr. Wadge, from the counties of Lake and
                Porter, having appeared since the last call - </p>
              <p>The President reported twenty-eight Senators present and answering.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved that the Senate adjourn,</p>
              <p>Messrs. Dittemore, Williams and others demanded the yeas and nays, but the
                President declared the motion carried, and that the Senate was adjourned till
                to-morrow morning at ten o'clock.</p>

              closely interwoven with your own, as to induce the careful and wise deliberation that
              the State demands. You have earnestly devoted time and attention, with industry,
              sodility, and ability, to the trust confided to your consideration. This is attested
              by the gratifying record you have made for efficiency. At this session there is
              comparatively no disturbing element, no question to embitter our personal
              acquaintance; our attachments are stronger; guided by enlightened reason and the
              observance of order, harmony, as before, will prevail, making our duties pleasant and
              producing profitable results. Allow me to thank you cordially for the honor of this

          <p>M. Haworth offered a resolution, which was adopted, providing for a committee of two on
            the part of the Senate to act with a similar committee on the part of the House of
            Representatives to wait on the Governor and ascertain when it will suit his pleasure to
            deliver his biennial address.</p>
          <p>The President made said committee on the part of the Senate to consist of Messrs,
            Haworth and Williams.</p>
          <p>Mr. Williams offered a resolution allowing each member to retain the seat he occupied
            at the special session, provided he desires to do so.</p>
          <p>This was amended, and after some dull debate, both carried. </p>
          <pb n="22" xml:id="VAA8558-14-022"/>
          <p>Mr. Glessner offered a resolution that a committee of three be appointed to report
            standing rules for the government of the Senate, and that until the committee report,
            the rules of last session be adopted for the government of the present session.</p>
          <p>Mr. Gooding moved to amend by making the committee consist of five members.</p>
          <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, moved to take up the concurrent resolution of the House of
            Representatives providing for a joint special committee of three members of each House
            to wait on the Governor and inform His Excellency of the organization of the two Houses,
            and to ascertain at what time he will deliver his message to the General Assembly.</p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. Daggy the Senate reconsidered the vote by which a similar resolution
            was adopted a few minutes since.</p>
          <p>On motion of Mr. Glessner a committee of three was appointed to inform the Lieutenant
            Governor of the passage of this resolution. The President made said committee to consist
            of Messrs. Glessner, Gooding and O'Brien.</p>
          <p>Mr. Dwiggins offered a resolution, which was adopted, that a committee of five be
            appointed to inquire into the propriety of appointing an official reporter for the
            Senate, and ascertain what is the best manner of publishing said reports.</p>
          <p>Hon. Leonidas Sexton, Lieutenant-Governor-elect, was admitted to occupy a seat on the
            floor of the Senate, and the President said: "Gentlemen of the Senate, I have the
            pleasure of presenting to you the Hon. Leonidas Sexton, Lieutenant-Governor-elect of the
            State of Indiana." Whereupon</p>
          <p>Hon. Leonidas Sexton said: "Gentlemen of the Senate, I return to you my sincere thanks
            for the honor conferred upon me by the adoption of the resolution you have just passed
            extending to me the privileges of a seat upon your floor."</p>
          <p>Mr. Dwiggins by consent introduced a bill [S. 168] for an act supplemental to an act
            entitled "an act in relation to the organization of the two Houses of the General
            Assembly prescribing the number of officers and employes of the two Houses, and
            declaring an emergency, which was read the first time. [It proposes to allow an
            additional clerk to each of the Secretaries of the Senate.]</p>
          <p>On motion of Mr. Dittemore, the House resolution for a joint convention of the two
            Houses of the General Assembly at two o'clock P. M. this day to hear the Governor's
            message, was taken up and adopted.</p>
          <p>Mr. Haworth submitted a report from the <orgName>Joint Committee</orgName>to wait upon
            the Governor, that His Excellency has designated the hour of two and half o'clock this
            afternoon for the delivery of his message to the General Assembly. And then came the
            recess till two o'clock this afternoon.</p>

            <p>Mr. Ramsey submitted the following:</p>
            <floatingText>
              <body>
                <div type="resolution">
                  <p><hi rend="i">Resolved,</hi> That in the reappointment of the standing
                    committees it is recommended that they be enlarged in the discretion of the
                    Speaker, so as to divide the honors and labors.</p>
                </div>
              </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>Mr. Branham. It is the experience of every man who has been on a committee that the
              difficulty is to get a majority, a quorum present. If you increase the number you
              increase the difficulty. I think that much the better plan would be to divide the
              labors; instead of appointing the same man on two or three committees put him on one;
              and so far as I am myself concerned I am perfectly willing to be left off all the
              committees or go on any, but I object to the enlargement of the committees.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ramsey. There is no doubt that in many instances gentlemen are placed on the
              committees at random; and as we become acquainted perhaps it would be desirable on the
              part of some to have a change - and this is what the resolution contemplates; not to
              change the committees.</p>
            <p>Mr. Branham. I move to make it a request to the Speaker to reorganize the committees
              in such a manner as he may deem best calculated to facilitate business.</p>
            <p>Mr. Butterworth moved to lay the matter on the table.</p>
            <p>The Speaker. The point of order is insisted on, and it will lie over.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mellett. I move for the appointment of a special committee of five to assist in
              the organization of the Senate.</p>
            <p>The Speaker. It is taken by consent. The gentleman from Delaware is Chairman. He may
              organize it himself.</p>
            <p>Mr. Woollen. I move that it be composed of Democrats. [Laughter.]</p>
            <p>Mr. Cauthorn. I give notice that on to-morrow I will offer the following: "To amend
              rule 38 so as to read, 'The following standing committees shall be appointed at the
              commencement of each session - to consist of as many members as the Speaker shall deem

            <head rend="center">THE GOVERNOR.</head>
            <p>Mr. Satterwhite submitted a concurrent resolution (which was adopted) for a joint
              special committee of three by the House, to act with a like number of said committee
              to be appointed on the part of the Senate, to wait upon His Excellency, the Governor,
              and inform him that the regular session of the General Assembly for 1873 is fully
              organized and ready to receive any communication he may see proper to offer.</p>
            <p>Mr. Edwards, of Lawrence, submitted a resolution, which was adopted, inviting the
              Senate to attend in the hall of the House of Representatives on Saturday, (to-morrow)
              at ten o'clock A. M., for the purpose of opening and publishing the election returns
              of the votes cast for Governor and Lieutenant Governor at the election held on the 8th
              of October, 1872.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wolflin now again submitted his resolution, that each member of the House of
              Representatives be furnished with four copies of the Daily Indianapolis Sentinel, of
              the Daily Indianapolis Journal, and of the Daily (German) Telegraph - three copies of
              each to be wrapped and stamped.</p>
            <p>Mr. Baker proposed to amend by adding: three copies of the Weekly Volksblatt.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hedrick proposed to amend by way of substitute to this effect: That the
              doorkeeper be authorized to contract with the publishers of the Indianapolis Sentinel
              and the Indianapolis Journal for one copy each of their daily papers for each member
              of the House of Representatives, one copy each for the principal and Assistant Clerk
              and one copy for the Doorkeeper.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thayer reasoned against the adoption of any such resolution as this from the
              provisions of the eight dollar per diem bill of the special session, and insisted on a
              distinct vote on this proposition as a test, showing whether in that act the General
              Assembly meant what they said. He voted for that bill with the distinct understanding
              that if he wanted newspapers and stationery he would pay for them himself. He trusted
              that gentlemen were honest in the passage of that bill, and stand ready to carry it
              out.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shirley was opposed to furnishing papers here at the State's expense; saying it
              in no feeling of unkindness towards the city editors. He would take a daily paper,
              whether this resolution passed or not, and pay for it himself. I, therefore, move to
              amend the resolution so that the door-keeper shall so order these papers that they
              shall be paid for by members themselves.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cowgill had voted for the per diem with the understanding that nothing of this
              kind was to come up. He voted for it to save, not the money of the people so much as
              the morality of the General Assembly.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gifford also voted for that bill; and when it cut off the stationery, he did not
              understand that the newspapers for our constituents were cut off. Such was not his
              understanding of the bill; and whilst he was denied the stationary, he was willing to
              vote for a reasonable amount of papers for our constituents at the State's
              expense.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lenfesty, at the time the per diem bill was passed I was in the manority. That
              bill could not have been passed had it not been that the stationery was cut off. As
              far as these papers are concerned, he has no German constituents; therefore his
              constituents have been compelled to pay for what they do not read. He proposed, that
              gentlemen go and purchase for themselves what papers they might desire to send
              out.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shirley withdrew his motion.</p>
            <p>Mr. Baker did not believe it was intended by the per diem bill to cut off the daily
              papers. The people want the daily papers and are perfectly willing to pay for them. He
              hoped the resolution would be adopted in one of the proposed forms.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wilson of Ripley. The per diem bill cut off stationery and the newspapers, and
              provided that we shall furnish these for ourselves.</p>
            <p>His people so understood it. At the late Session we paid out of the Treasury about
              fifty cents per member for daily papers, and he intended to furnish his constituents
              with newspapers, to that extent at least during this Session. He insisted that this
              resolution is something which we can not defend before the people - the per diem bill
              forbidding this additional expense - such was his understanding of the bill - and he
              drew it himself and so he had explained it to his people as a much needed measure to
              cut off the enormities of the expenditures here for stationery and newspapers. He
              hoped the House would vote the resolution down.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mellett did not vote for the per diem bill, but believed not that if we wisely
              construe the law it would prove satisfactory to the people. He believed that the
              people would rather pay the full amount of that per diem, than that gentlemen should
              get into the habit of stealing part of it. And in order that the House may give a
              proper construction to that bill he would oppose any and all such propositions as
              this.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kimball submitted the following by way of substitute; but it being beyond the
              third degree it was read for information:</p>
            <floatingText>
              <body>
                <div type="resolution">

                    that he is hereby directed to collect the cost of the <pb n="24"
                      xml:id="VAA8558-14-024"/> same from each member, and upon the refusal of any
                    members to pay for the same, the Speaker is directed to deduct the cost of such
                    papers from the per diem of such member so refusing.</p>
                </div>
              </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>Mr. Butterworth understood that gentlemen do not vote for those papers for their own
              benefit, for every gentleman knows that they are rather an incumbrance upen his desk.
              I object distinctly, however, to the intimation by the gentleman from Delaware (Mr.
              Mellett) that we have been stealing in the matter of furnishing newspapers for the
              people.</p>
            <p>They are taken in the interest of the people; and they were paid for by the State in
              the in-interest of the people. When the per diem bill was passed, he did not
              understand that it cut off the supply of papers; but still he did not think the people
              were much benefited by them.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cauthorn. I move that the further consideration of this subject be postponed till
              the second Tuesday in March next.</p>
            <p>Mr. Branham. I move that it be indefinitely postponed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shirley agreed fully with the gentleman from St. Joseph [Mr. Butterworth.] This
              matter of furnishing papers was not a matter of stealing, but custom - a custom, in
              his experience, which was rather burdensome. He had the honor of representing a
              constituency of reading men, and if they do not feel disposed to take the daily papers
              for themselves, he would not be their agent by voting to furnish these papers; it
              would be doing injustice to his people.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thayer demanded the previous question' and there was a second by the House.</p>
            <p>The Speaker ordered: The first question is on the adoption of the substitute for the
              resolution of the gentleman from Vanderburg, (Mr. Walflin) that the door keeper
              contract with the publishers for the Journal and the Sentinelone copy to each member
              and the clerks and doorkeeper.</p>
            <p>Messrs. Mellett and Thayer demanded the yeas and nays; and the substitute was
              rejected - yeas 0, nays 91.</p>
            <p>The question recurring on Mr. Walflin's resolution for four copies, it was also
              rejected - yeas 2, nays 87.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cauthorn submitted a resolution to the effect that the compensation of members of

              <p>Mr. Neff from the <orgName>Joint Special Committee</orgName>, to which was referred
                a resolution of inquiry as to the number of newspapers to be taken for the use of
                the members thereof, to be paid for out of the State Treasury, reported as
                follows:</p>
              <p>"At the last session of the General Assembly, a law was enacted increasing the pay
                of members of the Legislature from five to eight dollars per day with a prohibitory
                provision against the State furnishing stationery to members at the expense of the
                public treasury. Your committee would further state that by a strict construction of
                the law referred to, it embraces in the word 'stationery' newspapers. Therefore,
                they deem it not only unlawful but impolitic to contract for any number of
                newspapers to be paid for out of the public treasury as the per diem of members is
                now ample."</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown moved that the word "strict" be stricken out and the word "liberal"
                inserted in lieu of it. He was inclined to think that if a strict construction of
                the law is to be had it would exclude the idea that a subscription for newspapers is
                prohibited by the terms of that wise and just law.</p>
              <p>Mr. Neff accepted the amendment.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregg didn't think anything was lost by sending broadcast reports of
                legislative proceedings. He was in favor of letting the people know what is being
                done here, and inclined to the old system of taking newspapers and sending them out
                to the country. He believed this a class of legislation properly denominated "mock
                economy."</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner moved to amend the report by striking out commencing with the words,
                "your committee." and ending with the words, "any number of newspapers." He thought
                it would be a very liberal construction to include "newspapers" in the word
                "stationery." He didn't like such a construction of the law referred to as would
                exclude newspapers from the Senate, because it would in a great measure exclude a
                report of each day's proceedings from the desks of members. He was in favor of
                making it the duty of some officer of the body to provide Senators with copies of
                the daily newspapers printing reports of the proceedings, whether paid for out of
                the State Treasury or out of the pockets of members, is a matter of little
                importance.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Gooding the report and amendment were laid on the table that the
                House message may be considered. And thenOn his further motion, the House concurrant
                resolution for a joint convention at two o'clock this afternoon, for the purpose of
                electing a President of the Board of Commissioners for the Benevolent Institutions,
                a trustee each for the Blind, Deaf and Dumb, Soldiers' Home, Insane Asylum, and
                three directors each for the Northern and Southern Prisons, was taken up.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams moved to amend the resolution so as to provide that but two directors
                for the Southern Prison shall be elected.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gooding moved to lay the amendment on the table.</p>
              <p>The motion was agreed to, by yeas, 22; nays, 18,The resolution was then concurred
                in.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dittemore offered a resolution, which was adopted, that the mileage for the
                present session be the same as it was at the special session.</p>
              <p>Mr. Taylor, by consent, presented a petition from citizens of Tippecanoe county,
                praying for the enactment of a law forbidding the sale of or trafic in intoxicating
                liquors as a beverage, with such penalties as shall make it effective in suppressing
                such sale or trafic. It was laid on the table, there being no committees yet

              <p>Mr. Kimball called attention to the fact that the item of $445 submitted by him
                during the last session had been omitted from the Specific bill; and he asked and
                obtained leave to submit a resolution that the said sum be and it is hereby
                appropriated for payment of the funeral expenses of Colonel Norman Eddy, late
                Secretary of State, and that the <orgName> Committee on Ways and Means</orgName> be
                instructed to put the same in propriation bill for this year.</p>
              <p>Mr. Wilson, of Ripley - It seems to me that this is a liberality which is not
                warranted. If the funeral expenses of Colonel Eddy be allowed, then the funeral
                expenses of any other citizen might be allowed here. We have been cutting down the
                compensation of many who have been in the public service, and we are legislating
                here for economy generally. Why then adopt this?</p>
              <p>Mr. Kimball. This resolution was adopted unanimously at the last session, and he
                was sorry any gentleman should now rise and object to it. In answer to the
                gentleman, and for the reason of this, he said: "Col. Eddy was a man who belonged to
                the State of Indiana, and the nation; who had sacrificed every thing in the service
                of his country; who had been chosen Secretary of State by a large majority of his
                fellow citizens; whose perquisites had been cut off by the last Legislature; who
                died in poverty; and a man who was worthy of all the honors that the people of
                Indiana could heap upon him. I hope, therefore, that there will not be a single
                voice raised here against this resolution."</p>
              <p>Mr. Wilson was not aware that this resolution was ever before the House till now.
                Granting all the gentleman says of Col. Eddy, he insisted that we are legislating,
                and should not go a step beyond propriety. We have a great many good men, and some
                of them may die; and if we pay this claim, we establish a precedent. At the last
                session we made an appropriation of a large amount to the Secretary of State for
                extra services, which as he was informed, all went to the family of Col. Eddy. It is
                not proper that we should grant special favors; and this is special legislation.</p>
              <p>Mr. Mellett. One point seems to have been overlooked by the gentleman from Ripley.
                He makes no distinction between Col. Eddy and any other man. It must be recollected
                that Col. Eddy was an officer of the State, and he died from home, and his remains
                were taken thither for sepulture. This is a debt which the State owes to him and his
                family. The resolution was unanimously adopted.</p>

              <p>Pending these nominations for canal trustee, Mr. Senator Williams raised the point
                that, according to the conditions of the Funded Debt bills of 1846-7, it was
                requisite that the election of this officer should be by ballot of the two Houses of
                the General Assembly, and he sent up the particular section of the Butler bill to
                which he referred, and it was read by the Clerk.</p>
              <p>Mr. Senator Brown took the same position,and enforced it in a speech, closing with
                a motion for an order of the Convention that this election be taken viva voce.</p>
              <p>The President of the Senate declined to entertain the motion.</p>
              <p>Mr. Wilson, of Ripley, believed the presiding officer had decided correctly on the
                point of order, that the motion and resolution are out of order.</p>
              <p>The President of the Senate. The Chair is of the opinion, after consultation with
                the Speaker of the House, that the motion of the Senator from Jackson [Mr. Brown]
                was not in order; and I now so decide. I am further of the opinion that it is proper
                - indeed, that it becomes our duty under Section XIII of the Constitution of the
                State - to proceed to the election of this officer viva voce. Nominations are now in
                order.</p>
              <p>Mr. Senator Williams. Does the Chair decide that this convention has not the power
                to determine whether the vote shall be by viva voce or by ballot?</p>
              <p>The President of the Senate. The Chair is of opinion that the mode is prescribed by
                the Constitution.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams then moved that the vote be by ballot.</p>
              <p>The President of the Senate. That motion was held to be out of order a short time
                ago. The motion is clearly out of order now, for the reason that a similar motion
                was made and decided out of order, and no other business has intervened since.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams. Then I appeal from the decision of the chair made on the motion of
                the Senator from Jackson, (Mr. Brown.)</p>
              <pb n="28" xml:id="VAA8558-14-028"/>
              <p>The President of the Senate. It is too late.</p>

                Trustee - presuming the gentleman who nominated him will vote for him - to prevent

              <p> Mr. Senator Hall, when his name was called, said: In explanation of my vote I
                simply wish to state that I vote for a Republican instead of a Democrat because I
                conceive that I owe it to the State at large to vote for a man to occupy a position
                in which he may be called upon to decide upon a question involving some
                $18,000,000"a most discreet person" he should be, so the statute of 1846 declares. I
                think there is a large difference between such a person and a person who may have
                been accustomed to handle only sixpences and dimes, and probably never thought of
                the number of dollars representing the sum named, by cents even. We surely may be
                commended if, by our votes, we try to keep our State from the enormous debt which
                the Southern States are groaning under, and which have been increased by electing
                men to office who, on account of their previous condition, were unable to deal with
                questions that were brought before them. For these and other reasons, I vote for Mr.
                Nixon.</p>
              <p>Mr. Representative Kimball, when his name was called in explanation of his vote,
                said: I should cast my vote without a remark, but as the gentleman from Clark
                (Senator Hall) has deemed it proper to explain his vote, I claim the same right. And
                while it would afford me great pleasure, as I have done heretofore, in opposition to
                gentlemen on the other side of this House, to cast my vote for the Hon. Cyrus P.
                Nixon for Canal Trustee or any other office in the gift of the General Assembly, he
                having submitted his name to a caucus of members of the Republican party in this
                Assembly, and they, to use his own words, deeming it proper in their judgment to
                choose another than himself for this position, I am compelled to cast my vote for
                Mr. Hinton. And in further reply to the gentleman, I will say that as far as the
                computation of dollars and cents are concerned, Mr. Hinton is the equal of Mr. Nixon
                or the gentleman, or any other man in this House or in the State. As far as
                qualifications are concerned for the position, in the way of sense.</p>
              <p>Whether the gentleman means dollars or sense, he is the equal of any man who now
                composes that Board of Trustees. Mr. Hinton is a gentleman of education, a scholar
                and a Republican, and he proved himself true to his country, true to the rights of
                humanity, and true to Republicanism, and I will not sit in my seat and hear any
                reflection upon the ability, sense or qualifications of a gentleman that I know to
                be a person of moral worth and standing equal to any man in this Assembly, and the
                peer of his fellow-citizens of the State of Indiana. For State Librarian - </p>

              <head rend="center">PERSONAL EXPLANATION.</head>
              <p>Mr. Dittemore. I rise to a question of privilege. I have been informed that in the
                proceedings of the Joint Convention, last Saturday afternoon, I was represented by
                the Secretary as being present and not voting for directors of the Northern and
                Southern prisons. Such, sir, is not the case. If the record of the vote shows that
                it is untrue. I was not in the hall of the House of Representatives after the vote
                for State Librarian had taken place, at no time from that time on to the
                adjournment.</p>
              <p>The Senate refused the reading of the journal in question and the matter went
                over.</p>

              <head rend="center">APPOINTMENTS BY THE GOVERNOR.</head>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Dwiggins, a message just received from the Governor proposing,
                recommending and nominating the honorable Chas. F. Coffin as Commissioner of the
                House of Refuge, to serve from the first day of March, 1873, for a full term of four
                years from and after the said first day of March next, was taken up and read</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved that the nomination be confirmed by the Senate.</p>
              <p>Mr. Harney. I understand this is a motion to confirm an appointment made by the
                present Governor of the State to fill a vacancy which will not exist until next
                month. I would inquire whether it is competent now to make an appointment before
                that time or whether it would not be more proper to make the appointment it after
                that time?</p>
              <p>The President. I would state that in the opinion of the Chair it is not competent
                for the Senate to decide that question. That may be a question for the courts to
                determine. The nomination being before the Senate we can only confirm or reject the
                appointment.</p>
              <p>Mr. Harney. Is it to be supposed that the Senate is not to know anything about the
                law and can not determine the extent to which we may plainly go on the subject? Are
                we not to take notice of the law?</p>
              <p>The President. The chair has already decided that in the opinion of the chair all
                the Senate can do is to confirm or refuse to confirm the op-pointment.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott. What is the date of the expiration of the present term?</p>
              <p>Mr. Chapman. The first day of March.</p>
              <p>The yeas and nays having been demanded - </p>
              <p>The President directed the Secretary to call the roll.</p>
              <p>The nomination was confirmed by the Senateyeas, 20; nays, 14.</p>
              <p>A message from the Governor was read, stating that in making his appointments of
                Trustees of the State Normal School at the last session he had inadvertently
                overlooked the fact that the term of Hon. Timothy Nicholson had expired. Therefore
                his Excellency would now re-appoint and nominate the said Timothy Nicholson as a
                Trustee of the State Normal School, to serve as such for four years from the 1st day
                of December. 1871,</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Dwiggins, the nomination was ratified and confirmed by the

              <p>On motion of Mr. Dwiggins, his bill [S. 168] supplementary to the act in relation
                to the organization of the two Houses of the General Assembly, regulating the number
                of employes, etc.-allowing two extra clerks to the Principal Secretary and two extra
                clerks to the Assistant Secretary of the Senate, and one page for both - was read
                the second time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved to amend the bill by adding a section allowing the door-keeper
                to appoint one assistant in addition to the number he is now allowed.</p>
              <p>Mr. D. spoke in favor of his amendment and the passage of the bill</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele, Mr. Neff, Mr. Harney, and Mr. Dittemore submitted remarks.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown moved to amend the bill by providing one messenger for the standing
                committees of the Senate, and one clerk for each of the secretaries of the Senate,
                in addition to the number now provided by law.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams was anxious during the special session to ascertain the number of
                employees, but his resolution for that purpose was voted down. He referred to the
                long session of 1851-2, when the present Senator from Boone (Mr. Boone) performed
                the sectary's work with but two assistants, and declared there was probably more
                clerical work performed at that session of the Legislature than at anyone session
                since; and concluded by expressing the opinion that there was sufficient help now
                provided for the present secretaries, and consequently he should oppose both the
                bill and pending amendments.</p>
              <p>Mr. Boone also opposed the bill and amendments, as he saw many employes, now before
                the Senate, not moving a pen, but listening to this discussion with nothing else to
                do. He could accurately keep the entire journal of either House with the assistance
                of three men; and having many years experience as Clerk of the Legislative
                assemblies, he knew whereof he spoke.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown demanded the previous question.</p>
              <p>The demand being seconded by the Senate under the operations thereof.</p>
              <p>The amendment authorizing the principal Secretary to employ, when necessary, one
                clerk in addition to those now provided by law, was agreed to.</p>
              <p>The amendment authorizing the Assistant Secretary to employ one clerk in addition
                to those now provided by law, was taken by consent.</p>
              <p>The amendment proposed by Mr. Dwiggins was agreed to, as was also the additional
                section 4, adding providing for a messenger for the committees.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown moved that the bill be considered as engrossed, the constitutional
                restriction suspended and the bill put upon its passage now.</p>
              <p>The motion was rejected - yeas 26, nays 9 - two-thirds not voting in the
                affirmative.</p>

              <p>Mr. Harvey, in explanation of his vote, said he desired to see sufficient clerical
                force here to carry on the business speedily, and without delay, but inasmuch as the
                bill of last session was passed after careful consideration he would like to see the
                experiment tried with the present force.</p>
              <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>

              <p>A large assemblage filled, the hall of the House of Representatives, yesterday
                afternoon, to witness the inauguration of the Hon. Thomas A. Hendricks as the State
                Executive for the next four years. The room commenced to fill up a long time before
                the hour appointed for the exercises to take place, and among the number present,
                were a considerable number of ladies, who filled the aisles of the house and every
                available seat hot occupied by the members of one or the other branches of the
                Legislature. At two o'clock the house was called to order by Speaker Edwards, who
                announced the reception of a report from the Committee on the Inauguration, fixing
                the time for the ceremonies at half past two o'clock. Committees were appointed to
                escort the Judges of the Supreme Court and members of the Senate to the hall, and
                those dignitaries soon made their appearace, the House rising upon their entrance.
                Messrs. Cauthorn and Glasgow of the House, and Williams of the Senate, were
                appointed an escort for Governor Baker and the Governor elect to the room.
                Lieutenant Governor Sexton having been unavoidably kept away by a railway detention.
                The appearance of Governor Hendricks and the retiring Governor, arm in arm, soon
                after, was the signal for enthusiastic applause. They were given seats at the
                Speaker's desk. President Freidley then announced the result of the vote for
                Governor, and declared in accordance therewith, that Thomas A Hendricks and Leonidas
                Sexton were duly elected to the offices of Governor and Lieutenant-Governor
                respectively. A few minutes after the stated time for the inauguration, Judge
                Buskirk administered the oath of office to Mr. Hendricks, the swearing into office
                being preceded by an appropriate prayer by Rev. Dr. Bayliss, of Roberts Park

              <p>Governor Hendricks, after being introduced as the executive officer for the ensuing
                term, by his predecessor, then delivered his inaugural address, occupying just half
                an hour in its delivery. It was listened to with close attention from all present,
                and the general impression at the close was that it is in all respects an able and
                timely document.</p>
              <p>
                <hi rend="i">Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives</hi>
              </p>
              <p>In assuming the duties of the office to which I have been chosen, I invoke God's
                blessing upon our people and State.</p>
              <p>It is primary among our obligations to see that every duty which the State owes to
                the United States is faithfully discharged, and that the rights and powers of the
                State are maintained and upheld. Between the rightful authority of the State and the
                powers of the United States there should be no conflict, and if they be asserted and
                exercised in the spirit of the Constitution, and with a proper appreciation of their
                relations, there will be none. Under the Constitution, each State and the United
                States are so related that support of one is fidelity to both, and hostility towards
                either is hostility to both. The exercise of unwarranted authority by either
                provoked collision, and is a public wrong.</p>
              <p>The Federal power has become so great, the area of its operations so extended, and
                the allurements to its service so seductive, that our most watchful care is
                necessary to preserve the proper dignity and just influence of the State. It should
                attract attention, and excite serious concern when local troubles, and controversies
                growing out of matters wholly of State concern, are made the pretext for the
                interposition of Federal authority, and the menace of national arms. Surely you will
                agree with me that Indiana is so great a commonwealth, and her people are so
                entirely capable of self-government, that every question and controversy connected
                with her policy, or growing out of her action, and within the sphere of her reserved
                sovreignty as a State of the Union, must be settled and adjusted according to her
                pleasure, and by her authority.</p>
              <p>My conduct upon all questions that touch the relations between the State and the
                United States, shall be governed by an earnest desire to preserve the legitimate
                authority of both, and to maintain the most sincere harmony.</p>
              <p>By the prompt and full discharge of every duty and the exercise of a fraternal
                comity, I will labor to promote a cordial and enduring friendship between Indiana
                and the other States.</p>
              <p>The welfare of the people requires that there be harmony between the Legislative
                and Executive departments of the State. For the recommendations I may make to you,
                pursuant to the constitutional requirement, I ask your respectful consideration; and
                I assure you that when the results of your labors shall be presented for my
                examination, your judgment will have its proper weight and influence upon any
                action; and I will take care that the laws you may pass shall be faithfully
                executed, in the spirit of their enactment and of the Constitution.</p>
              <p>It is not expected of me upon this occasion to consider, with any degree of
                particularity, the subjects of legislation that may occupy your attention at the
                present session. That duty has been discharged by rny predecessor. But I can not
                avoid a reference to some subjects of special interest and importance.</p>
              <p>Equal and just representation, and the integrity of the popular vote lie at the
                foundation of public authority; and the perversion of the one, or the corruption of
                the other, tends to the destruction of republican and free institutions. The
                preservation of both is among the most sacred obligations of the legislator.</p>
              <p>The laws regulating our elections require your special attention. They do not
                restrain the cor-<pb n="34" xml:id="VAA8558-14-034"/>rupt, nor protect the votes of
                the people. Our elections must not become a reproach. Their result must express the
                will of the people. Our system must be made so efficient as to guarantee purity in
                the conduct and management of the elections, and also to inspire and establish
                public confidence. When the people know that a political result has been fairly
                brought about, all discontent disappears; they cheerfully acquiesce, and yield
                entire obedience to the authority thereby established. I can not now attempt to
                suggest all the provisions that may be essential to an efficient system, but without
                the following no system will probably prove efficient:</p>
              <list type="ordered">
                <item> A fair and real representation upon the board of election officers of all
                  political parties having candidates to be voted for;</item>
                <item>Voting places so numerous, and the precincts so small, in respect to the
                  voting population, that all who offer to vote may be known by the people of the
                  neighborhood, as well as by the officers.</item>
                <item>
                  <p>A reasonable period of residence in the election precinct as a qualification to
                    vote, so that persons may not pretend a residence not real, in fraud of the
                    law.</p>
                  <p>You will find an amendment of the second article of the constitution necessary,
                    to enable the Legislature to prescribe such period of residence. The
                    constitution wisely provides for its own amendment, by a convenient and
                    economical proceeding, which renders it unnecessary to throw upon the people the
                    expense of a convention, and avoids the possibility of changes not desired by
                    them.</p>
                </item>

                <item>The exclusion of money, as an influence and power, from the elections. If in
                  the contests for power money shall become stronger than the people, we will have
                  the worst government possible. It will be a reproach to us all, when wealth can
                  buy what the loftiest talent, and the purest virtue can not attain.</item>
              </list>
              <p>In this connection I wish to call attention to the subject of representative
                reform, which, during the last ten years, has been advocated by some of the best
                minds, both in Europe and in this country, and is now undergoing the test of
                experience. I desire to make this the more emphatic, because in this State it seems
                yet to be regarded as right and proper, for the majority to deny to the minority
                even that representation, which an apportionment based upon population, and
                contiguity of counties would give. Representative reform rests upon the proposition
                that minorities of constituencies should have a representation as nearly in
                proportion to numbers as may be practicable. All the citizens contribute to the
                burdens of government, and should yield obedience to the laws, and it is just,
                equal, and fair that all should be represented. One of the ablest of English
                statesmen, in the debate in the House of Lords, on the reform bill of 1867,
                suggested this illustration; suppose a representative district has ten thousand
                voters, and six thousand are of one side in politics, and four thousand of the
                other, would that district not be better represented if both the six thousand and
                the four thousand were represented, than if the votes of either be wholly rejected,
                and without influence or power? He added: "I can well understand men who are
                extremely intolerant and exclusive in politics, objecting to give any voice to those
                whose political views are distasteful to them; but I can not understand such an
                objection being urged by those who are in favor of having public opinion fairly
                represented."</p>
              <p>The advantages of this reform are obvious. Political asperities would be modified;
                local satisfaction would be produced: the temptation to corruption and bribery at
                elections would be greatly removed; and security and permanency would be given to
                the influence and power of the minority, thus securing a check upon the majority,
                should it become arrogant or unscrupulous, so that legislation would proceed more
                for the people and less for party.</p>
              <p>This constituted a striking feature in the great reform measure of 1867 in England,
                a measure which greatly increased the powers and fortified the rights of the
                industrial classes in that country; it was partially adopted in the selection of
                delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1867, in New York; it is recognized in
                the selection of jury commissioners and election officers in Pennsylvania; and is an
                important provision in the new Constitution of the great State of Illinois. This
                reform has also been the subject of careful consideration in Congress. On the 2d of
                March, 1869, Mr. Senator Wade, from a select committee, reported a bill providing
                for its adoption in the election of Members of Congress. I will not undertake an
                examination of the different propositions whereby representative reform may be
                attained; that will be carefully considered by the Legislature, should a
                constitutional amendment on the subject be submitted to the people; but as a
                practical illustration of one of the modes, I quote the bill as repurted to the
                Senate by Mr. Senator Wade, "A bill to amend the representation of the people in
                Congress. Be it enacted, etc. That in elections for the choice of Representatives to
                the Congress of the United States, whenever more than one Representative is to be
                chosen from a State, each elector of such State, duly qualified shall be entitled to
                a number of votes equal to the number of representatives to be chosen from the
                State, and may give all such votes to one candidate, or may distribute them, equally
                or unequally, among a greater number of candidates, and the candidates highest in
                vote upon the return shall be declared elected."</p>
              <p>The people expect at your hands substantial reforms in the civil service of the
                State. The Legislature of 1871 attempted the correction of many abuses, by the act
                of the 21st of February of that year, but that legislation has failed to accomplish
                most of the purposes of its enactment. Many of the courts have held important
                provisions invalid, for want of constitutional sanction. Extortion and constructive
                fees and charges should be prohibited and prevented. Complete reform will require
                the abandonment, in a large degree, of the system of fees and perquisites as a mode
                of compensating public officers. As far as may be practicable, fixed salaries should
                be established, and all other compensation prohibited. Thereby the temptation to
                make questionable and unlawful charges will be removed. The compensation which you
                may allow should be sufficient to secure the best ability and the highest
                qualifications, but not large enough to promote corruption in the contests for the
                offices.I cordially concur in the recommendation of my predecessor of a liberal
                increase in the salaries of the Judges of the Supreme Court; and I also recommend an
                increase in the compensation of the other judges of the State. The welfare of
                society is involved in the character of the judiciary. The people do not desire, nor
                can they well afford, the economy of cheap judges. Causes delayed, with accumulating
                costs; the time of jurors, parties and witnesses wasted; increased appeals to the
                Supreme Court; and the wrong done to private rights, all forbid it. The judicial
                districts and circuits have, in many instances, been increased beyond the demands of
                the public interest. It is becoming an embarrassment in the way of providing proper
                compensation for an adequate number of judges.</p>
              <p>Personal and local importunity ought not to prevail over the public good. This evil
                should be corrected. Unnecessary circuits and districts should be stricken out, and
                those that remain so adjusted as to give full employment to competent judges, and to
                apportion the labor equally among them. If this be thoroughly and intelligently
                done, upon a basis of population or business, the judiciary may be strengthened and
                elevated, the necessary number of judges may <pb n="35" xml:id="VAA8558-14-035"/> be
                well paid, and at small, if any, increase of cost to the people.</p>
              <p>I am not prepared to say that our present judicial system is inherently defective.
                Many of the evils complained of result from the legislation enlarging the
                jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas, and thereby confusing the jurisdictions
                of that court and the Circuit Court; and perhaps the evils may be removed by your
                investigation and action. But if it be your judgment that a general revision and
                modification of the system is necessary, then I recommend that a commission of men
                eminent in the law be provided, who shall report a plan of reform at the next
                session of the Legislature.</p>
              <p>I recommend that provision be made for the more secure keeping of public moneys. It
                is not just to require public officers to retain a personal custody thereof, and to
                denounce degrading penalties against them if they fail therein, and at the same time
                to leave them without adequate protection. But in no financial policy whatever,
                should the officers he allowed to make a gain to themselves out of the use of public
                money. That tends to corruption, and the insecurity of the theasury.</p>
              <p>I need not urge you to extend a protecting and fostering hand over our free
                schools, and to guard with anxious care the funds that support them. Coming as you
                do, from among the people, you can not be indifferent to an influence so important
                to their welfare, and to the true dignity and strength of the State.</p>
              <p>I trust the laws you may enact will promote the moral, intellectual and material
                walfare of the people.</p>

            <p>President George W. Friedley in the chair.</p>
            <p>The reading of the Secretary's minutes of yesterday's proceedings was interrupted by
              the entrance of members of the House of Representatives, appearing to witness the
              inauguration of the Hon. Leonidas Sexton as Lieutenant Governor of the State of
              Indiana.</p>
            <p>Order having been restored, the President of the Senate (the Speaker of the House
              sitting on his left) said: Gentlemen - I take pleasure in announcing that the Hon.
              Leonidas Sexton, Lieutenant Governor elect of the State of Indiana, is now present and
              ready to receive his oath of office. He will be sworn in by the Hon. Alexander C.
              Downey, one of the Judges of the Supreme Court.</p>
            <p>The Hon. A. C. Downey then administered the oath of office to Mr. Sexton - both
              standing with uplifted hands in the following words:</p>
            <p rend="blockquote">"You do solemnly swear that you will support the Constitution of
              the United States and of the State of Indiana, and that you will honestly and
              faithfully discharge your duties as Lieutenant Governor of the State of Indiana, so
              help you God."</p>
            <p>The President of the Senate. Gentlemen, I take pleasure in presenting to you the
              Lieutenant-Governor of the State of Indiana. [Applause.]</p>
            <p>The Lieutenant-Governor then taking position toy the side of the President's chair,
              spoke as follows:</p>
            <p>
              <hi rend="i">Gentlemen of the Senate:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I enter upon the duties of presiding officer of the Senate with many misgivings as to
              my ability to perform them, to your satisfaction.</p>
            <p>To you, gentlemen, all having had much experience in the business of legislation,
              those duties are simple and of easy accomplishment; but to one wholly unused to them,
              they do not appear free from difficulties. I shall be agreeably disappointed if, like
              many other anticipated troubles, they shall disappear as they are approached. But I
              shall probably often be led into errors of judgment, and in advance of them, I solicit
              both your forbearance and kindly assistance. The methods by which you are to proceed
              in the performance of your duties as Senators,when there are not constitutional
              provisions, are to be found either in that body of common parliamentary law, used by
              deliberative assemblies every where, or in those rules which yon have adopted for your
              own government. In either case you will expect those rules to be observed with
              reasonable strictness, and so far as it depends upon me, I shall endeavor to enforce
              them with exact fairness to all, remembering, that, in this matter of rights, Senators
              are upon an exact equality. It is your authority I am called upon to maintain; to see
              that Senators are decorous toward each other; that discussion and action shall be free
              according to your own rules - all of which are necessary, to the end that your
              sessions may be rendered pleasant to yourselves, and that the needed legislation of
              the State be speedily and certainly accomplished. Your standing as Senators - the
              dignity of your position as representatives of great and intelligent constituencies,
              to say nothing of your personal comfort, will require from you a cheerful and prompt
              support, in all efforts to forward these objects.</p>
            <p>After the expiration of the ten minutes, the Lieutenant-Governor called the Senate to
              order, and said as a matter of convenience to himself, he would ask Mr. Friedley to
              take the chair.</p>
            <p>It is not my province to recommend to you such measures as I may deem expedient, nor
              to give you information touching the affairs of State, nor do I assume to do so; yet I
              may without impropriety, congratulate you upon the favorable auspices under which you
              have assembled. We have just closed an interesting chapter in our State history. The
              retiring State Administration may well be proud of what has been done in the interests
              of the people and for the honor of the Commonwealth. The State is substantially out of
              debt, and altogether her finances are in a good condition, and the State credit highly
              satisfactory. Those great public charities required by the Constitution are all in
              successful operation, and others have have been projected and in progress of
              completion,or awaiting the further action of the Legislature. Our common school system
              is more perfect than ever before, and is perform- <pb n="37" xml:id="VAA8558-14-037"/>
              ing its mission so thoroughly and so well that it has overthrown its early opposition
              and fastened itself upon the hearts of the people; while our courts, supreme and
              inferior, are accomplishing their work in a manner generally satisfactory. So that it
              is not far from the truth to say, that in Indiana, at least, the purposes for which
              States are organized, are reasonably well performed. But the changes constantly made
              in a great and growing State, requires that the Legislative power should in the
              exercise of its functions, keep pace with the changing condition of society, and
              provide for every new want; so that while we may not hope for an end of legislation,
              we may at stated periods say: That every unfortunate is provided for; every child has
              the means of education; that every citizen is protected in his rights; that violations
              of the law are duly punished, and public morals maintained. So we may say to our
              retiring State officials, your work has been well and faithfully done, and you are
              entitled to too favorably remembered by a gratified people. And only yesterday we have
              inaugurated a new State government for a period of four years. At its head is a
              gentleman whose reputation as a statesman, in other departments of government, has
              outrun the limits of his own country, and gone forth to the nations of the earth: and
              he will be anxious not only to maintain that reputation, but to add to it, by
              suggesting and carrying forward in this new governmental employment such measures in
              behalf of the people and State as will vie with, if not outshine, anything done by any
              of the illustrious men who have preceded him in his high office. Such recommendations
              as he from time to time shall have to make to the Legislature, having in view the
              welfare of the people of the State, are entitled to your careful consideration, and if
              they meet the approval of your judgment, should be met with a cordial and liberal
              support by the legislative branch of the State Government. He has been indorsed in a
              legal and constitutional manner by the people, in his election to the highest office
              known to our State laws, and opposition to him, based solely on party grounds, should
              be put aside in that friendly, nobler, and more patriotic contest likely to ensue, in
              which each party shall put forth every exertion, having in view only the good of
              society and the lasting welfare of the people. While Senators are not expected to
              forget their immediate localities and constituencies, nor yet their party
              affiliations, they are to remember they are State Senators, and that laws enacted by
              them are not circumscribed by the lines of a single county or district, nor do they
              effect only a few thousand citizens living therein; but that on the contrary, those
              laws are in force from the Miami to the Wabash, and from the Ohio to the lake, and
              affect, favorably or unfavorably, the interests of nearly two millions of free people.
              These considerations require at your hands an enlarged and liberal view of your high
              position as State Senators, and appeal with power to your high sense of honor as well
              as patriotism. We rejoice at the present well being of our national affairs, and are
              glad that we are at peace with other governments; that we as a nation have one
              government, and as a people are united and happy - offering a home, a shelter, and a
              welcome to the down trodden and misgoverned people of the whole earth; and while our
              patriotism should be broad enough in its scope to comprehend every portion of our
              country, and we should remember with becoming pride, the glorious part the people of
              our State took in its preservation; yet, at this time, you will not be regarded as
              wanting in high and statesman-like qualities, if your best efforts are devoted to the
              legislation required by the condition of the people of our own State, and the comfort
              and happiness of our immediate homes. Gentlemen, I thank you for the courtesy of this
              brief hearing, and again I ask you, that, in the attempt to perform the duties of my
              office, you shall be as free in my support and kindly in your forbearance of my
              shortcomings, as I shall be liberal in seeking these favors at your hands.</p>

                third judicial Circuit viz: Gibson, Parker, Davies, Martin-Dubois and Pike, and it
                was passed to the second reading. Mr. P. said this was not proposing to create an
                additional circuit. It simply proposed to place the people of the old circuit in the
                same position they were before the passage of the act of the last session. He
                desired to make a motion to suspend the restrictions so that the bill might be put
                on its final passage.</p>
              <p>Mr. Riggs hoped the restrictions would not be suspended, and that the bill would
                not be passed, because it throws the counties of Posey and Vanderburg outside of any
                circuit.</p>
              <p>Mr. Peed said it leaves Vanderburg and Posey just in the same position in which the
                act of the last session left the counties of Pike and Dubois. After debate by

              <p>Mr. Baxter moved, ineffectually, to refer the bill to the Joint Special Committee

                motion, the restrictions were suspended, and the question on the bill was advanced
                to the final passage. After further debate, in which Messrs. Wolflin, Peed, Baxter,
                Dial, Butts, Shirley, Heller, Mellett and Walker participated, the bill failed -
                yeas 50, nays 27 - for want of a constitutional majority.</p>

                approved May 6,1852. (When the case shall have been dismissed without the knowledge

                receive now, and desired that it should be made a special order.</p>
              <p>Mr. Wolflin moved, ineffectually, to make it the special order for to-night, at
                half-past seven o'clock.</p>
              <p>Mr. Lenfesty regarded it as a bad measure; that its effect would be to drag into
                society every abandoned woman in the State. By closing their haunts, the business
                houses of the State would be infested with them.</p>
              <p>Mr. Baxter. There is a provision in this bill which enables us to send these
                persons to the Reformatory for their reformation; and he regarded the passage of
                this bill as one of the most beneficent things the Legislature could do.</p>
              <p>Mr. Mellett regarded the proposed legislation as very important. As to the
                objection of the gentleman from Grant [Mr. Lenfesty], he could not see that the bill
                would have that effect. It will have the effect to close these houses of evil fame,
                and compel their inmates to seek other business.</p>
              <p>Mr. Miller. If he voted against the bill, it would be because he knew nothing about
                it.</p>
              <p>The Speaker. That is no objection to the final vote. The bill was read twice during
                the last session.</p>
              <p>Mr. Thayer was very much surprised to hear <pb n="40" xml:id="VAA8558-14-040"/>
                gentlemen say they knew nothing about this matter. It seemed to him that every man
                should know something about this festering sore that has fastened itself upon the
                community in so many ways. He was also surprised at the position taken by the
                gentleman from Grant - that the punishment of a crime should be to encourage and
                increase the same order of criminality. He was not himself prepared to make a speech
                on the bill; but he stood ready, at all times, to give his vote and influence for
                the relief of society from wrong-doers. The gentleman talks about girls being driven
                into business houses; but did not every gentleman know that there are thousands of
                prostitutes that, instead of being invited, would be forced from their haunts by
                such legislation as this bill proposes? The father of every family in the State -
                every man who has a son or daughter - has a deep interest in this legislation
                against this licensed professional prostitution. It is scattering disease and death
                all over the land. He urged the gentleman to consider the remedy; and in doing so it
                was proper to look at this evil in all its odiousness, and to throw around the sons
                and daughters of the State all the safeguards we can to protect them from
                beguilements into the ways that would lead them down to degradation and death.</p>
              <p>Mr. Stanley demanded the previous question, and there was a second, and under that
                pressure the bill was finally passed the House of Representatives. Yeas, 70; nays,
                3.</p>
              <p>The House then took the recess till two o'clock P.M.</p>

            <p>The Speaker laid before the House the message from the Senate announcing the refusal
              of that body to concur in the current resolution of the House of Representatives,
              declaring that the House will not vote for an appropriation to pay for newspapers for
              the General Assembly. Thereupon debate arose in which Messrs. Wilson of Ripley, Cobb,
              Shirley, Offutt, Buskirk, Henderson, Walker, Heller, Kirkpatrick, and Thayer
              participated.</p>
            <p>Mr. Woolen. I desire to offer a supplemental bill to the per diem act for the present
              consideration of the House; and there being no objection he introduced a bill [H. R.
              315] for an act supplemental to an act fixing the per diem, of members of the General
              Assembly, and providing that no additional perquisites shall be allowed. He said the
              object is to provide by law that no allowance shall be made to members of the General
              Assembly for newspapers, but that the per diem now allowed by law shall be in full for
              their compensation. He would also suggest an amendment specially stating that no
              appropriation for newspapers or stamps furnished members of the General Assembly shall
              be allowed. I will now ask that the whole subject be referred to a special committee
              of three.</p>
            <p>It was so ordered by unanimous consent; and the Speaker makes the committee to

            <p>Mr. Billingsley, from the <orgName>Committee on Printing</orgName>, returned the

              <p>The Speaker announced the special order, viz.: The consideration of the Governor's
                biennial message as in <orgName>Committee of the Whole House</orgName>, Whereupon
                the House resolved into <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName> - Mr. Woollen in
                the chair - and the Chairman announced the order.</p>
              <p>Mr. Lenfesty - Mr. Chairman, I move that that part of the Governor's message which
                relates to a Bureau of Statistics be referred to the Committee on Statistics and
                Emigration. The motion was agreed to; and then, on the motion of Mr. Walker, the
                committee rose and the Chairman reported progress, and asked and obtained leave to
                sit again at three o'clock P. M.</p>
              <p>The report was concurred in, and the order was made accordingly.</p>
              <p>The Speaker. At the adjournment of the morning session the House had under
                consideration the bill No. 217 (Mr. Cobb's promissory note bill). Mr. Shirley
                proposed to amend the act so that "as to all bills of exchange executed in this
                State and payable within or without the State, and all promissory notes executed in
                this State and made payable either within or without the State, the maker or makers
                thereof shall have the right to answer, under oath, that said noter was given for a
                patent right, and then such maker or makers shall have all the right of answer as
                the payer or payers thereof." If we can constitutionally make such an amendment as
                this he desired to do so. As he understood the bill, according to its provisions no
                man in the State can make a promissory note unless he is a banker or a merchant.</p>
              <p>Mr. Cobb. It does not affect the law as it now stands, with regard to bills of
                exchange. It simply affects a certain class of notes not known at common law, but
                made by statutory enactment. It does not touch inland bills of exchange. It simply
                changes the law in regard to what is not known as commercial paper. The proposed
                amendment goes a great deal farther in the way of inovation than I am willing to
                go.</p>
              <p>Mr. Shirley. The amendment applies only to notes given for patent rights; and they
                have to swear that they were given for such a consideration. It does not apply to
                any other kind of paper. The bill needs this restriction, for it strikes down that
                class of paper which is worth more to businessmen generally than any other kind of
                paper. The way he understood it would very unfavorably affect the largest commercial
                interests in the State.</p>
              <p>Mr. North recognized the benificence of patent rights, and admonished the House
                against special legislation in this matter.</p>
              <p>Mr. Miller suggested the unconstitutionality of the amendment, and the fact of the
                decision of Judge Drummond that the owner of a patent has the right to sell it all
                over the State.</p>
              <p>Mr. Cole moved, ineffectually, to lay the amendment on the table; and then - </p>
              <p>On the motion of Mr. Furnas, the bill and pending amendment were referred to the
                  <orgName>Committee on Manufactures and Commerce.</orgName></p>
              <p>Mr. Jones introduced a bill [H. R. 316] to authorize Township Trustees to levy to
                the amount now authorized by law - not exceeding twenty-five cents on the hundred
                dollarsfor the purpose of satisfying and liquidating any township debt created in

            <p>The Lieutenant Governor overruled the point of order.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dwiggins replied to the objection raised by Mr. Hough. This question is a
              distinct subject for legislation, and why not have a <orgName>Committee on Woman's
                Suffrage?</orgName></p>
            <p>Mr. Chapman moved to amend by striking out "Woman Suffrage" and inserting in lieu a

            <p>Mr. Dwiggins raised the point of order that the amendment is not germain.</p>
            <p>The Lieutenant Governor sustained the point of order.</p>
            <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, opposed the raising of a committee of this kind, being
              satisfied the Senate is composed of gallant gentlemen entirely; further, he disliked
              the idea of raising a committee which shall receive the monopoly of attention from
              ladies.</p>
            <p>The motion for an additional standing committee on woman's suffrage was rejected, by
              yeas 17, nays 25.</p>
            <p>The motion for a standing committee, No. 33, on mines and mining was agreed to.</p>

              qualifying so far as to recommend that the proposed increase of the powers of the
              institution so as to enable it to hold real estate to the value of $300,000 be
              considered as blank to be filled by a vote of the House. He said the committee were
              not prepared to report as to the amount of real estate which the corporation should
              hold, but preferred to defer that to the action of the House, under the suggestions of
              the framer of the bill or some one else.</p>
            <p>The bill having been read by the Clerk - </p>
            <p>Mr. Butterworth. I move to retain the amount in real estate, or to put into the blank
              $300,000. The reason of this increase is that real estate has become very valuable
              there. It is near the city of South Bend, and one of the largest of the Catholic
              institutions of learning in the United States. It has also amongst its colleges a
              Manual Labor School, and there is a large number of students. Their present charter
              allows them but $30,000 in real estate. But such has been the advance around there in
              the value of this species of property that their original possessions in real estate
              have become worth about $300,000 - of which they can hold but $30,000 under their
              present charter.</p>
            <p>Debate followed, in which Messrs. Henderson, Givan, Buskirk, Shirley, Butterworth,
              Woollen, Wilson of Ripley, Thayer, Ogden, Cobb and Miller took part. Mr. Wilson of
              Ripley, proposed to recommit the bill to the Committee on the Judiciary, with
              instructions to amend it as to allow the institution to hold and purchase property to
              the extent of their chartered powers.</p>
            <p>Mr. Butterworth moved, ineffectually, to lay the morion on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cobb proposed to add to the instructions to this effect: That they may hold the
              real estate they now have to the extent of $300,000.</p>
            <p>The motions for instructions were agreed to, and so the bill was recommitted.</p>

              providing bounties for red fox scalps, and empowering County Commissioners to provide
              additional bounties, with an amendment: "said clerk, on such presentation of said

            <head rend="center">THE INCURABLY INSANE.</head>
            <p>Mr. Branham called up, by way of a motion to reconsider the vote on its adoption, the
              concurrent resolution of yesterday requiring the joint standing <orgName>Committee on
                the Benevolent Institutions of the State</orgName> to prepare and report plans for
              buildings for the care of the incurably Insane; to consider the Governor's
              recommendation to divide the State into Central, Southern and Northern Districts for
              this purpose, and to report a bill providing for the same. And when the vote was
              reconsidered he said he had doubted a little that this resolution might have passed
              the House without the proper consideration. He wanted the resolution to express what
              the House sincerely requires. The order of the resolution requires a great deal of
              work to prepare the plans and make the estimates; and the committee do not want to go
              to this expense without assured and unmistakable authority. He would have the
              resolution passed by yeas and nays.</p>
            <p>Mr. Butterworth. It was his opinion that we ought to have but one institution for the
              care of the insane in the State.</p>
            <p>Mr. Richardson. I hope the House will put itself on the record in favor of the
              proposition for another hospital for the insane.</p>
            <p>Mr. Branham. It was not in the mind of the committee to do anything more than to
              district the State according to the recommendation of the Governor, and to propose the
              plans and estimates for the buildings. The committee do not want to act unless it is
              necessary - unless it is the settled mind of the House - and we are satisfied that it
              will not be possible for the State during the next two years to do more than the
              preliminary work. He doubted if the House were intelligently determined to go on with
              the work; and whether they did or not, he wanted to know it expressly.</p>
            <p>Mr. Barrett was in favor of enlarging the present hospital - or of making twobut did
              not know why we should have three. But as the gentleman from Jefferson says we will
              not be able to do anything for two years, he would prefer to do something now - to do
              something at once to relieve the present demand for patients.</p>
            <p>Mr. Richardson was decidedly in favor of enlarging the capacity of the Hospital for
              the Insane, and in favor of two more buildings. He believed that would be done. If
              there is not money enough in the Treasury, he would be willing to authorize State
              officers to issue bonds for a loan for that purpose.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lenfesty said the people of the State are ready to take care of those unfortunate
              insane, and they desire that all the money that is necessary may be expended in that
              direction. The House should adopt this resolution without a division, and thereby
              encourage this committee to prepare the necessary legislation. It was a disgrace to
              the State that these unfortunate people are in so many cases entirely without
              attentive care.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shirley understood that the House has once passed this resolution, but he had no
              objection to the call on the part of the Committee for the House to pass it by yeas
              and nays, tor the assurance of earnestness and sincerity.</p>
            <p>Mr. Branham. It was the intention of the committee to make the Hospital for the
              Insane near Indianapolis as large as it can be made under the original design; and the
              committee will recommend the expenditure of as much money as it is prudent to expend
              on the present hospital; but from the information we have, we understand that it can't
              possibly be made to accommodate all the patients that should come into it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Miller desired to know whether another bulding is practicable on the same
              grounds?Mr. Branham. There is plenty of room. But it seems to be the unanimous opinion
              that there are certain limitations to improvement in those buildings, and that about
              $50,000 would be what should be expended for the economical management and
              administration of the institution.</p>
            <p>Mr. Miller was unable to see why there could not be an additional building put up on
              the same ground that would give immediate accommodation and relief to patients. After
              that is done he might be willing to divide the State into districts for the more
              complete accommodation of the people of the State.</p>
            <p>Mr. Furnas had rather a limited acquaintance with this institution; but he was
              satisfied, if the opinion of the present Superintendent was worth anything, that the
              building there is as large now as it is necessary to make it. The original plan is
              complete; and if attempts were made to enlarge the design, it would throw the whole
              thing out of order, and it would not succeed. He thought that if we were to undertake
              an entirely new set of buildings, it could not make it much better; and the fact
              remains that <pb n="51" xml:id="VAA8558-14-051"/> only one-third part of those wanting
              homes there can be accommodated. We placed ourselves on the record at the last session
              for an increase of our per diem, while the wants and sufferings of those patients have
              been calling on us for relief all this time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thompson, of Elkhart, was interested in this question on account of the expense
              of the transportation of inmates, and was in favor of dividing the State into hospital
              districts. As far as his part of the State is concerned, he knew of counties that
              stand willing to donate the land for a hospital site; and the expense of another
              building would be saved in two years time out of what is now paid for the
              transportation of patients. And then we want a separate institution building for the
              incurably insane.</p>
            <p>Mr. Woollen, if in order, would like to offer a resolution to test the sense of the
              House on this question. It was read for information to the effect, that, in the
              opinion of the House, all appropriations made at this session for the purpose of
              increasing the accommodations for the insane should be applied and confined to
              increasing the accommodations and enlarging the capacity of the present buildings.</p>
            <p>The Speaker. This is a concurrent resolution and can not be amended in that way.</p>
            <p>Mr. Woollen. I withdraw it then.</p>
            <p>There was an unsuccessful motion by Mr. Hardesty to amend by striking out the words,
              "Central, Northern and Southern."</p>
            <p>The resolution was then adopted - yeas 81, nays 1.</p>
            <p>Messrs. Blocher, Cline, Cole, Given, Isenhouer, Lenfesty and Schmuck obtained
              temporary leave of absence - all till next week.</p>
            <p>The Speaker laid before the House the Senate message announcing their concurrent
              resolution for a hearing of the American Woman Suffrage Association this afternoon in
              this Hall at half-past two o'clock, and it was concurred in.</p>
            <p>The Speaker also (informally) announced to the House an invitation to witness some
              Fire Extinguisher on wheels somewhere this afternoon at two o'clock P. M.</p>
            <p>Mr. Branham presented a claim, and Mr. Brett a petition.</p>

            <p>The Speaker resumed the chair at twenty minutes past two P. M., and after the
              requisite preliminaries, the Senators were received and seated on the right, the
              President of the Senate presiding, to hear the memorial and addresses of the American
              Woman Suffrage Association.</p>
            <p>The memorial was read by the Clerk of the House of Representatives, and its

                SCENE IN THE HOUSE - DEMANDING THE INALIENABLE</head>
              <p>All of Indianapolis of a strong minded sort; all of the women who despise the
                tyrant rule of man and weep like Rachel for the dead babe of equal rights, came
                together in the assembly of the sages to listen to the concentrated spice of
                suffrage life. The Chamber was crowded and the scene like a gala day in Congress.
                The very young ladies present were interested in the members, while the members
                seemed interested in the mammas. Among the younger law-makers there was unseemly,
                but suppressed, levity, as the delinquent caught the eagle eye of outraged womanhood
                fixed in scorn upon them.</p>
              <p>In a silence of eager expectation the Lieutenant Governor presented the first
                speaker, Mrs. Margaret B. Longley Of Cincinnati. Mrs. Longley spoke substantially as
                follows: In behalf of these petitioners I desire to call your attention to the
                injustice done to half your people by the present system of legislation and to ask
                your honorable body to take such action as shall remove the cause for
                dissatisfaction. In attempting to show the justness of woman's claim to the ballot
                box it is not necessary to go back beyond the declaration of principles upon which
                this Government is based. Having so long maintained such a system of government, we
                can but conclude that the principles are approved of by the people, and it will be
                unnecessary to discuss principles upon which we are all agreed. My task will be to
                show, according to these principles, and according to justice and the spirit of the
                Constitution, that women are entitled to the same rights and privileges with men,
                including that of the ballot.</p>
              <p>Occupying the position of subjects, and experiencing the disadvantages of such a
                position, our forefathers became convinced that a government which does not derive
                its powers from the consent of the governed is not a just one; and with the hope of
                benefitting future generations, they desired to establish in America such a system
                of government as they believed would most effectually secure the equality of all
                before the law. And, as we are told, in order to secure the blessings of liberty for
                themselves and their posterity, they ordained and established the Constitution of
                the United States. This Constitution was to provide for the protection of all the
                people. But the rights of one-half the people have been ignored. The powers that be
                failed to respect the intent of our forefathers to secure the blessings of liberty
                for their posterity. Having enjoyed without question political freedom themselves,
                men fail to think of those who are deprived of it. Indeed many of them did not seem
                to realize that an aristocracy has been established in America which is no less
                oppressive than that of the past, and one which is much more unnatural, because it
                places those bearing the near relation of husband and wife, son and mother, in
                opposition, as superior and subordinate. I mean the aristocracy of sex. The civil
                laws speak boastfully of the guarantees of justice to every American citizen in its
                ballot, and of the advantages of a republican government. While one half of our
                citizens are denied all participation in its affairs, can such a government be
                called a republican government? What is a republic? Jefferson says a republic means
                a government of citizens in mass, acting directly and personally according to rules
                established by the majority. But all citizens of the United States do not act
                personally, and are not governed according to any rule established by the majority.
                Women being excluded, but one-half the citizens vote. Consequently, it is not a
                government of the majority, but one-half the people govern this country.</p>
              <p rend="center">"IT IS SOMETIMES"</p>
              <p>Said that the phrase "the people," as used in the Constitution, does not include
                women, and should not be understood literally. This is an untenable position</p>
              <p>The lady referred to and read some of those clauses in amendments to the General
                Constitution, which prescribes the right of the people to be secured in their
                persons, houses, papers, etc., against unreasonable search and seizure; and from
                this and similar clauses of that instrument reasoned at length, that the words
                "people," "citizen," "men," "man," etc., are used with <pb n="52"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-14-052"/> reference to race and not to sex; and logically, thence
                deduced life right of the woman to the ballot. The intuition of the speaker caught
                the strong points of her message, reaching eagerly to the fact that the people of
                this State are contemplating a convention to amend the organic law, so much so that
                it seemed to the listener sometimes as though the address was to such a convention
                of the people sitting as a committee of the whole on the single question, which
                freighted the sheet to the classical and eloquent peroration, to this effect. Then,
                if we honor human develment, let us have it in all its purity. The world needs the
                influence of woman no less than that of man. If women fail to exert the perennial
                influences on the social world, or on the political world, society is defrauded; for
                the combined gifts of God's creatures is necessary in order to perfect the great
                design. Then let women have full scope for all their powers. There need be no fear
                that women will lose their femine characteristics, for, be assured, they are too
                firmly implanted by the Creator. Remember, gentlemen, as your law books tell you,
                the political position of woman is a disgrace to a civilized nation - the theory of
                the laws degrade them almost to the level of slaves - and then say if there is any
                question of equal importance with woman suffrage before the American people. I trust
                that I address persons capable of laying aside prejudice, and of deciding a case
                according to the evidence and according to justice, regardless of preconceived
                opinions and prejudices; therefore, I hope that our woman's petition will be
                granted; that you will give it at least your serious consideration.</p>
              <p rend="center">MRS. CUTLER.</p>
              <p>The Lieutenant Governor then introduced Mrs. H. M. F. Cutler, who spoke briefly to
                the following purport: Gentlemen of the Committee and of the Legislature of IndianaI
                count myself happy this day that I have the privilege of presenting before your
                honorable body the grand question of the age, and I do it with the more pleasure
                because I recognize how the great principles of our republican institutions have
                grown into your hearts, have enlarged your views, have lifted you up till you stand
                above all mere prejudices; and I am reminded of that exquisite sentiment of Sir
                William Chase:</p>
              <lg type="free">
                <l> - "What constitutes a state?</l>
                <l>Not high rais'd battlements or labored mounds,</l>
                <l>Not tow'r and moated gates; not cities proud</l>
                <l>With spires and turrets crown'd," etc.</l>
              </lg>
              <p>It is to such men that I address the great question of the age - men who know their
                rights and know their duties - and knowing their rights and duties, they will never
                abridge the rights and duties of any of their class. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I came
                to you, at the request of the Executive Committee of the American Woman Suffrage
                Association, who have taken upon themselves the duty of presenting their question to
                the American people. They have asked Mrs. Longley and myself to go before the
                several Legislatures of the States of this Union, and, if possible, present this
                question so clearly and earnestly, that you might be prevailed to remove whatever
                disabilities as to the suffrage there exists. I know you all must have felt
                sympathizingly for the second speaker while listening to the first. You must, all of
                you, have said; What is left for her? The whole ground has been so thoroughly gone
                over that there is nothing else to hear. As far as the argument is concerned, she
                has brought it all before you, clearly, distinctly and logically, but you know that
                when a good itinerant has preached a sermon, he naturally wants somebody to follow
                him with an exhortation. So this lady continued in a voice of superior richness, and
                with great pleasantry, to make her address to the convention of rather a personal
                and anecdotal character, which was well received, as was the address of Mrs.
                Longley, with frequent and sometimes irrepressible applause, to the close.</p>
              <p>And then after some explation by Mrs. Swank and others with reference to what
                seemed to have been a conflict of appointments of the agents of the American
                Association and the Indiana Association, the Lieutenant Governor prorogued the
                convocation, and the ladies and Senators retired.</p>
              <p>The Speaker again called the House to order.</p>
              <p>Mr. Thayer gave notice to the House of the intention or Mr. Hardesty to submit a
                motion to reconsider the vote of yesterday by which the Satterwhite empyricism bill
                [H. R. 101] was defeated; and it was ordered that the motion be entered on the
                journal. The House then adjourned. </p>

            <p>Mr. Woolen took notice, that the other day when he introduced a bill on the subject
              of divorce the report of its provisions in the Journal was entirely incorrect. And in
              the Journal this morning there is an editorial perversion of it. The bill says nothing
              about what persons shall be prohibited from marrying on account of color, or
              differences in color. The truth is the Journal has taken the pains and its privilege
              of attacking a bill without knowing anything about its object or its provisions. The
              provision which the Journal refers to is simply the present law that is, that such
              marriages shall be void without judicial proceeding. Again, the Journal, by
              insinuation, seems to cast some reflection on the county which I represent, and I want
              to say here that whenever it may be expedient that a bill be introduced to prevent
              white and black from intermarrying, I shall leave the matter to the honorable member
              from the county of Marion, and all I fear about it is, that the resulting act may be
              declared unconstitutional on account of local application.</p>

            <head rend="center">THE DIVORCE LAW.</head>
            <p>Mr. Steele, Chairman of the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned. Mr.
              Orr's bill [S. 117] regulating the granting of divorces, with a recommendation that it
              be indefinitely postponed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Orr explained that the bill requires a three years' residence before a divorce
              shall be granted, and not then even except for causes named in God's Word. He desired
              to wipe out the reproach now resting upon, the State because of our loose divorce
              laws, and moved to amend the report by requiring that the bill shall lay on the table
              for the present.</p>
            <p>Mr. Daggy, being liberal in his views on the question of divorce, favored the general
              clause in the present law, which leaves much to the discretion of the court. A man and
              woman when tied together, not as man and wife, but as two distinct persons in constant
              conflict, all moral and social good requires that they should be separated, and
              forever, he opposed the motion to lay this bill on the table, and argued in favor of
              its indefinite postponement. Before he had concluded - </p>
            <p>Mr. Gregg called up the special order for this hour, being his bill [S. 4] for the
              assessment and collection of taxes for municipal purposes, on shares of banks or
              banking associations in this State - an exact copy of the bill [H. R. 6] of the
              Forty-seventh General Assembly which passed the House at that session - the question
              being on the minority report from the <orgName>Committee on Banks and
                Banking</orgName>, in opposition to the majority report, which recommends a
              substitute taxing the shares where the owner resides and not where the bank is
              located.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gregg argued in favor of the passage of his bill, which he regarded as correct in
              theory and perfect in all its provisions.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown was not very much in favor of the provisions embodied in the bill
              recommended by the minority of the Committee on Banks, neither did he believe the
              right to tax the stocks of national banks for city purposes was clear. And he was not
              in favor of the idea of taxing men who live out in the country and own a few shares of
              bank stock for the purpose of helping to keep up a city government, and for this
              reason he preferred to support the substitute bill the majority of the committee had
              proposed, if he supports any. In conclusion he moved that this bill be referred to the
              Judiciary Committee, with instructions to inquire whether any further legislation on
              this subject is required.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dwiggins favored the substitute bill because the law of last session provides
              that bank stock shall be taxed for municipal purposes at the place where the bank is
              located; while he insisted the tax should be levied and paid where the stockholder
              resides, and that there is no rule of right that would tax it in any other way.</p>
            <p>Mr. Winterbotham believing the bill to be in clear violation of the law of Congress
              on the subject, should vote for the motion to refer to the Committee on the Judiciary.

              <p>The Lieutenant Governor now recurred to the order pending at the time the special

              <p>Mr. Daggy, in looking at the bill, believed a change such as is proposed would work
                a greater evil to the State than the present law.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins, as a substitute for the pending motion, moved to recommit the bill to

                abandonment, and adding as causes impotency and a conviction of felony subsequent to
                marriage. Under the present law one Judge will decide one way and another a
                different way. He favored a residence of three years, as the bill provides.</p>

              <p>Mr. Steele, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, returned Mr. Daggy's bill [S. 110]
                to repeal section 18 and amend section 24 of the act regulating descents, with a
                recommendation from the majority that it lie on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Daggy, from a minority of said committee, recognizing the rights of married
                women to the property of their husbands at death, and to relieve the statute of the
                odious distinction in sections 18 and 24, recommended the passage of the bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. Daggy stated the object of the bill was to strike down the law allowing the
                widow only a life interest in the real estate of her deceased husband. Then the bill
                leaves off the proviso "If a man marry a subsequent time," etc. He thought the wife
                was entitled to one-third of her husband's real estate - not dependent upon whether
                or not she marries a second husband. He favored enlarging the rights of married
                women; and, although in conflict with a majority of the committee, desired the
                Senate to take action upon the question as brought up by the minority report.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele combatted the minority report, and a debate, participated in by Messrs.

              act of June 18,1852, approved February 3, 1858, recommending its passage. He said: The
              law at present requires the publication of the sheriff's advertisement for the sale of
              real estate in a newspaper that is published nearest to the land. This works a
              hardship on the sheriff sometimes to determine the nearest newspaper which becomes
              material to the title he gives. This bill does away with that feature of the law, and
              requires that it be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. The
              old law provides that the newspaper shall be printed in the county; this bill, that it
              shall be printed and published in the county. The old law requires that it shall be

            <p>Mr. Shirley, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned Mr. Wilson of
              Ripley's bill [H. R. 276] to prohibit the several courts and county boards in this
              State from making any allowance to county officers for stationery, and providing that
              such officers shall furnish their own stationery, recommending that the same be laid
              on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wilson of Ripley. In this bill I provide that the courts and county commissioners
              shall not hereafter make any allowance to county officers for stationery, except for
              the record books, and I desire to point out some of the abuses under the present
              system. And as we are called upon by the people to cut down all abuses, it seems to me
              that we have a golden opportunity which we ought not let pass. The State is now paying
              no less than $300,000 a year for Stationery for the county officers, when, in
              contemplation of law, this should be paid by the county officers themselves; and they
              put in under the head of stationery four-fiths of all the items of supply for their
              offices. Wherever we find such an abuse of power, we ought to put our hand on it. Let
              gentlemen go to their county offices and to the records, and under the head of
              expenses for stationery they will find pens, inkstands, gold pens, erasers,
              cork-screws and other like things that can not properly come under the head of
              stationery, such as pocket knives, memorandum books, etc. And this is carried on to
              such an extent that they even get from the traders a bonus per cent. on their
              purchases. The County Clerk gets fifty cents for his summons, which he procures at the
              State's expense; whence he gets not only enough for himself, bat for all his friends.
              Besides, when he retires from his office, he takes with him enough of these articles
              of stationery to last him through the term of his natural life. [Laughter.</p>
            <p>]When he had concluded, debate was still further indulged by unanimous consent, and
              Messrs. Barrett, Buskirk, Walker and Shirley took part - pending which, the House
              adjourned. </p>

              Glessner's bill [S. 123] providing for a lane seventeen feet wide between parties who

            <head rend="center">TEAMS ON HIGHWAYS.</head>
            <p>Mr. Fuller, from the <orgName>Committee on County and Township Business</orgName>,
              returned Mr. Neff's bill [S. 163] to amend Section 7 of the Supervisor's Act, to allow
              two day's work for a team instead of three, with a recommendation that it be
              indefinitely postponed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Neff resisted the report, declaring that the difference between the work of a
              laborer and a team was a mistake. He moved to amend the report by inserting a
              recommendation that the bill pass.</p>
            <p>Mr. Beeson also opposed the report and favored the passage of the bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. Rhodes favored a law that would require as much labor for the State as parties
              receive for the same pay all over the country, and consequently he hoped the motion to
              amend the report would be agreed to.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cave thought the report should be concurred in. When a man takes his team and
              plow or cart he should get credit for three day's work because the work is hard on
              teams, on plows and upon wagons, and the man with a team does as much work as six men.
              For himself, he would not take his team on the road for a two day's credit.</p>
            <p>Mr. Neff insisted this was an exceptional case. He desired to place the rich man and
              the poor man on an equality, and believed this bill does that in this particular.</p>
            <p>Mr. Orr believed putting a man and his team down to $3 a day is too little.</p>
            <p>[Mr. Taylor called up the special order - being the biennial message of Gov. Baker
              and the inaugural address of Gov. Hendricksand on his motion the consideration thereof
              was postponed till Monday next at two o'clock P. M.]</p>
            <p>Mr. Gregg desired to see the report of the Committee concurred in for fear the result
              of the bill would be to keep teams from off the road.</p>
            <p>Mr. Fuller referred to the fact that men with teams on railroads get three times the
              pay a man with the shovel does.</p>
            <p>Mr. Steele did not believe that teams can be obtained in every part of the State for
              a credit of two days' work.</p>
            <p>Mr Francisco has acted a great many times as supervisor of highways, and did not
              believe teams would come out for a two days' credit only.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ringo regarded one man with a team as worth half a dozen men with shovels. He
              would rather his plow would work on his farm one season than two days on the road, and
              would rather his team would work one week on the farm than one day on the road.</p>

              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved that the bill [S. 9] fixing the salaries of judges be made the
                special order for to-morrow at half-past ten o'clock.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gooding indicated a desire to lay this motion on the table, to await action on
                the subject of re-districting the State for judicial purposes.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins insisted that this bill should be voted upon at an early day,
                contending that it will do no good to wait until the State is re-districted. He
                opposed further postponement of the consideration of this bill, fearing it never
                will become a law. No State in the Union pays its judicial officers so small a
                salary as the State of Indiana, and that should be remedied as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dittemore announced that his vote on this subject would be controlled by the
                number of circuits established; and he moved to amend the motion by fixing the time
                for this order on Wednesday next at two o'clock P. M.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown was opposed to a cheap judiciary, and trusted the General Assembly would
                make <pb n="64" xml:id="VAA8558-14-064"/> haste to put the judiciary of the State on
                a respectable footing as regards salary. He favored increasing the salaries of
                Supreme Judges to $5,000, and Circuit Judges to $3,000. He desired to see Common
                Pleas Courts abolished, and the Probate business put in the hands of a surrogate in
                each county, to be appointed by the Circuit Judge.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gooding believed the passage of the bill would be endangered if pressed to the
                final vote before an agreement has been made as to how the circuits shall be
                constituted - their size and the juridiction of the Judges thereof. He favored an
                increase of the salaries of Judges, but thought it best to postpone the
                consideration of this bill for the present.</p>
              <p>Mr. Sleeth also favored increasing the salaries of Judges, but was opposed to such
                action till the circuits shall be defined. If better talent is obtained for the
                lower benches the work of the Supreme Court will be materially lessened.</p>
              <p>Mr. Orr was willing to vote an increase of Judges pay, but must first know what
                service will be required of them.</p>
              <p>Mr. Rhodes reminded Senators that this same argument for delay was urged a week
                ago.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott, when he entered this chamber four years ago, introduced a bill for an
                increase of the salaries of judges, but it was postponed from time to time till it
                was lost sight of. Two years ago a similar bill fared the like fate, and it now
                looked as though this bill was following in the same pathway. There are none too
                many judges in this State now, and Senators may just as well act upon this bill at
                once as to keep putting it off.</p>
              <p>The motion to make the bill the special order for Wednesday at six o'clock was
                agreed to.</p>

              <p>The Lieutenant Governor laid before the Senate the report of the Superintendent of

              <p>The Superintendent of Public Instruction, divides the School Fund into three
                classes: Productive, unproductive and contingent. The Fund productive of interest,
                is over $8,000,000. Total of all classes, $8,437,593 47.</p>
              <p>Indiana stands at the head of the list of States, in respect to the amount of her
                school fund. She expended last year for tuition purposes exclusively $1,108,312
                42.</p>
              <p>He reports the money safely invested and the interest promptly paid. The usual
                number of school houses have been built and of a rather superior order, as indicated
                by the cost.</p>
              <p>&gt;Asks for an extention of the limit of bonds $30,000 to $60,000, and that

                section of the law authorizing persons, not heads of families, to participate in the
                selections of teachers. Represents the Normal school as prosperous, its influence
                being felt more and more each year; is destined to become the great heart of our
                common school system; should be liberally sustained by the Legislature.</p>
              <p>Complains of absenteeism as the great evil of our school system; more than 27,000
                persons in the State, between the ages of ten and twenty-one, being unable to read.
                Argues that as our system of popular schools was established for all, all should
                attend. Asks a compulsory law, and submits the draft of one similar in its
                provisions to the Michigan law. Proposes the following amendments to the school
                law.</p>

              </list>
              <p>The compensation of the State Superintendent is fixed by law at $1,500. Is this a
                fair remuneration for the labor performed? I leave this question with the good
                judgment of the Legislature. The erection and completion of a great system of
                education is not the work of a day. Our present system has existed, in some form,
                for nearly fifty years. Each succeeding Legislature has contributed something to the
                strength and beauty of the superstructure, either by placing a suitable stone upon
                its walls, or by removing an unsuitable one. That there are defects still, all must
                admit, but that these can and will be remedied in due time, none need doubt. The
                emendations suggested in the former part of this report are all very desirable. Two
                of them, however, are so completely identified with the success of the system, that
                at the risk of being considered tedious and given to repetition, I refer to them
                again in the close of this report:</p>
              <list type="ordered">
                <item>An amendment securing an increase in the duration of our school terms.</item>
                <item>A law requiring a more general attendance upon the schools.</item>
              </list>
              <p>The former can be accomplished by one of the three following means, or by all
                combined.</p>
              <list type="ordered">
                <item>By a fair and equitable appraisement of property.</item>
                <item>By requiring the trustees to levy an amount of local tuition tax, which,
                  combined with their ordinary revenues, will increase the school terms to six
                  months.</item>
                <item>By an increase in the rate of the State tax.</item>
              </list>
              <p>It costs the State $21,430 50 per day to educate her children. An additional tax of
                one cent on each one hundred dollars to the sixteen already authorized, would extend
                the average school term three days: two cents, six days, and in the same ratio lour
                cents, making the State tax twenty cents, would prolong our school twelve days. May
                I not appeal to the Representatives of the wealthier counties to. give another
                demonstration of their liberality generosity and patriotism, by increasing this tax
                to twenty cents on each one hundred dollars ? This bei ng done, the legislature can
                with propriety demand that all school corporations aid themselves.</p>
              <p>The latter - a more general attendance - can be accomplished by the adoption and
                prudent enforcement of an obligatory law, similar in its general features to those
                adopted by other States.</p>
              <p>These two objects attained, our school system and schools begin to approximate
                perfection. Each day added to the school term, and each child introduced into the
                schools, not only increases the amount of intellectual and moral capital, but also
                the material wealth of the country. Wealth is more in the mind than in the object.
                Educated mind imparts value, riches, convenience, beauty, comfort and refinement to
                everything else. It makes the "wilderness and the solitary place glad, and causes
                the desert to rejoice and blossom as the rose."</p>

            <head rend="center">STATIONERY - COUNTY OFFICERS.</head>
            <p> The Speaker recurred to the unfinished business of yesterday, viz: Mr. Wilson of
              Ripley's bill [H. R. 274] prohibiting the various courts and Boards of County
              Commissioners from making any allowance for stationery to county officers, and
              providing that such officers shall furnish their own stationery the question being on
              concurring in the report of the Committee on the Judiciary, that it be laid on the
              table.</p>
            <p>By unanimous consent, the debate thereon was continued by Messrs. Wilson of Ripley,
              Shirley, Woollen, Buskirk and Miller.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cobb demanded the previous question, and there was a second, and under the
              pressure thereof it was brought to a vote, which resulted - yeas 40, nays 45 - as

            <head rend="center">EMPYRICISM.</head>
            <p>The Speaker recurred again to Mr. Hardesty's motion which was filed last Friday to
              reconsider the vote by which the House rejected Mr. Satterwhite's bill [H. R. 101] to
              protect the citizens of the State from empyricism, and elevate the medical
              profession.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thayer. My object in desiring the reconsideration of this vote is because there
              were but seventy-five members present when the bill wax rejected; and I think it is
              entitled to consideration and discussion on its merits, and then if gentlemen should
              think it will not be for the benefit of the people, I shall be willing that it may be
              voted down. But, sir, the people of my region are very anxious for legislation on this
              subject. All the surrounding States have such a law as this bill proposes, and the
              result is that the State of Indiana is filled with quacks - those medical adventurers
              and vampires of the life of the more helpless classes. I have, myself, one objection
              to the bill, and that is - it is not sufficiently strong and stringent in its
              provisions; but I desire to see it placed on the statutes, so that we may have a
              beginning in this line of legislation.</p>
            <p>Debate followed, in which Messrs. Blocher, Hatch, Barrett, Mellett, Billingsley,
              Dial, Richardson, Woodard and Butterworth took part. The House refused to reconsider
              the vote - yeas 45, nays 47.</p>

                it gives to the civil townships the same rights that cities and towns now have us to

              <head rend="center">PUBLIC PRINTING.</head>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Billingsley, the Senate joint resolution to make temporary
                provision for the public printing (to authorize the Secretary of State, the Chairmen
                of the two Committees on Printing in the two Houses, advising and consenting with
                him) to contract with some person to do the State Printing etc.</p>
              <p>It was concurred in and passed by the House of Representatives - yeas 50, nays
                36.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brett submitted a motion to reconsider this vote. On examining the resolution I
                find that it contains no restriction whatever. The Secretary of State and the
                chairmen of these committees can contract for the public printing at any price. They
                are not even required to invite competition. And we do not know how long these
                contracts may be extended. I do not think that the object we had in view when we
                abolished the office of State Printer will be accomplished by this resolution. When
                we abolished that office we did it upon the assurance that the printing could be
                done at much lower rates. And when I voted for this joint resolution from the
                Senate, I did so under the impression that it contained the proper restrictions. I
                therefore move for the reconsideration in good faith, and if the reconsideration is
                made, I shall move for such amendments as will require the chairmen of these
                committees and the Secretary of State to invite competition.</p>
              <p>Mr. Woollen. The reason I voted against that joint resolution was this: Because I
                thought I saw in it that which might authorize the Secretary of State to make the
                contract for the public printing to continue for the next two years, if be desired
                to do so.</p>
              <p>Mr. Walker. The resolution is a mere temporary expedient; it provides merely for
                the <pb n="68" xml:id="VAA8558-14-068"/> printing of bills which we want from one
                day to another. I move to lay the motion to reconsider on the table,- but at the
                request of Mr. Kimball he withdrew the motion.</p>
              <p>The vote was then reconsidered.</p>
              <p>Mr. Butterworth moved to refer the joint resolution to a select Committee of
                three.</p>
              <p>Mr. Peed proposed the standing Committee on Printing, and his motion was rejected.
                The question recurring on Mr. Butterworth's motion, - </p>
              <p>Mr. Woollen suggested instructions to amend so that the proposed contracts for
                printing will not extend beyond this session of the General Assembly. He withdrew
                this motion at the request of Mr. Cauthorn; and the joint resolution was referred to
                the select committee without instructions. Said committee consists of Messrs. Brett,
                Walker and Billingsley.</p>

            <p>Mr. Harney explained that this bill was drawn up in reference to some cases that have

              12,1869, where without authority, such aid had been granted; the bill is also intended

                them referred to the proper standing committees of the Senate.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown explained that the bill provides for a case where counties along the line
                have voted large sums of money to aid a railroad. (The officers say the road is
                permanently located, but in his county not a spade full of earth has been moved, and
                the object of this bill is to restrain the collection of the tax until a sufficient
                amount of money is expended upon the road that will justifying the paying over of
                the money in so large sums.)</p>
              <p>Mr. Carnahan indorsed what was just said, and stated he would go so far as to vote
                for a bill withholding the money until trains have passed through the county.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele was of opinion that this bill would ruin the prospects of many counties
                in this direction.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner gave a case in point to show the necessity of perfecting this bill and

              <p>Mr. Sleeth joined in asking that the constitutional restriction be suspended that
                this bill may be advanced on the calendar. He cited cases where taxes are levied and
                are being collected where the road missed the county altogether.</p>
              <p>Mr. Smith also desired this bill perfected as speedily as possible.</p>
              <p>Mr. Cave referred, to a case in his own county where taxes have been collected in
                aid of a railroad that will, never be run through the township. He, too, hoped to

              <p>Mr. Hall moved to amend the bill by adding a proviso, "that any condition of rates
                which demands payment of attorneys' fees shall be void."</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregg hoped this amendment would be adopted. He believed it would meet with the
                approbation of the bar of his and of the whole country.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Beardsley, it was laid on the table - yeas, 28; nays, 17.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele moved to amend the bill by appropriately adding these words: "Provided
                further that no greater rate of interest than six per cent shall be allowed on any
                judgment rendered by any court in this State." He argued in favor of the adoption of
                this provision, alleging that legislation should favor the unfortunate debtor, and
                declared that the bill would affect injuriously this class unless an amendment
                similar to the one he offers shall be adopted. Six per cent, he said, was as much as
                the poor man can bear; if he agrees to pay more let him live up to his contract, but
                when it comes to a judgment the contract is closed and the law should protect him
                against a greater rate of interest than six per cent.</p>
              <p>Mr. Orr opposed the amendment because custom has placed the rate of interest at ten
                per cent. </p>

              <p>Mr. Sleeth, in order that this matter might be fully discussed, moved the subject

              <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown, Chairman of the <orgName>Committee on Railroads</orgName> returned the
                railroad aid bill [H. R. 297] with amendment, adding to section 2 the words, "in the
                county or towns making the donation," and authorizing the suspension of the tax
                until the railroad has expended an amount of money on such road equal to the amount
                of aid granted, etc.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins insisted that the tax should be carried forward from year to year, but
                not returned delinquent.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown so corrected the report.</p>
              <p>The report of the committee was concurred in.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown moved that the bill be read the third time now and put on its
                passage.</p>
              <p>The motion was agreed to and the bill read the third time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hall called attention to the fact that the constitutional restriction was
                suspended only for the purpose of reading the bill by title for the purpose of
                reference.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown, for the purpose of clearing all doubt about it, moved a further
                dispensation of the constitutional restriction that the bill may be pot on its
                passage now. The motion was agreed to - yeas 35, nays 9. The bill was then read the
                third time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott said the bill recites unconstitutional and illegal things, for the
                Constitution expressly declared that no stock can be subscribed by county
                commissioners until the money is in the treasury; said the bill was too imperfect in
                its details to be passed into a law, arid it attempts to change the original
                contract already made between the people and railroad companies, by saying that the
                tax shall not be put on a duplicate until certain other things are done, and were it
                not a corporation on the other side, this bill would fail to pass by a very large
                vote. The bill passed by yeas 30, nays 9.</p>

              according to the report of the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>. He reasoned at

            <p>Mr. Pratt from the Select Committee thereon, returned the joint resolution [S. 5]
              making temporary provision for the public printing, with an amendment, adding these
              words: "Provided, that the said printing shall be done on the best terms that can be
              secured in the city of Indianapolis; that no printing shall be so done except what is
              necessary for the General Assembly at the present session; and that no contract for
              the same shall extend beyond the close of this session. And so amended the committee
              recommend the adoption of the joint resolution.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lenfestey. It occurs to me there will be considerable printing to be done besides
              what is necessary for the General Assembly. By the amendment to the resolution, it
              would cutoff all the State's printing except what is necessary for the General
              Assembly, and certainly there are many things to be printed coming from the State
              offices.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brett. If any such printing be necessary the order of the General Assembly can
              readily procure it; and I understand that a law to regulate the public printing will
              soon be passed. The amendment was agreed to and the joint resolution adopted on the

            <p>Mr. Carnahan explaining his affirmative vote, believed the amendment unnecessary, as
              the bill would not affect contracts heretofore made.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gooding, explaining his negative vote, desired this amendment, so that the
              question may be placed beyond cavil.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thompson voted "no," holding the Senator from Vanderburg (Mr. Gooding)
              responsible.</p>

              Williams, Boone and Dwiggins; which will appear in the Brevier Legislative Reports - </p>

            <p>The Senate seconded the demand for the previous question.</p>

              ordered, by - yeas, 14; nays, 29.</p>
            <p>Mr. Boone moved, as a substitute for the amendment, (Mr, Gooding's) a clause to this
              effect: "Provided this act should apply only to contracts executed after this
              act.'</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown thought the substitute out of order, a similar one having been already
              voted down this morning.</p>

            <p>Mr. Daugherty, stating that the House amendments, as reported to his bank bill [S. 2]
              were imperfectly reported, on his motion the bill was ordered to be returned to the
              Clerk of the House for correction.</p>

            <div type="section">
              <head rend="center">PRESIDENT PRO TEM.</head>
              <p>Mr. Chapman rose to a point of order, viz: that no person under the constitutional
                provision in Art. V, section 11, can preside over the deliberations of the Senate,
                except such a member as shall be elected for the occasion - each and every occasion
                - when the Lieutenant Governor shall be absent. He contended that the proceedings of
                this body would be illegal unless the express terms of the constitution be complied
                with in this particular.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins considered the word "occasion " in the section referred to means that
                the member elected shall serve thereafter during the session - on every occasion -
                whenever the Lieutenant Governor shall pbe absent. We having a precedent long
                established, he thought it unnecessary to discuss the question.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams challenged the Senator to point out a case where a President pro tem.
                has held during the session when there was an acting Lieutenant Governor. Having
                himself been a member of the Senate for twelve years he knew it was the custom to
                elect a President pro tem. for every occasion when the Lieutenant Governor was
                absent.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner read the 11th section of Article V of the Constitution, and declared
                there was nothing therein to prevent the election of a President pro tem. to serve
                during the entire session whenever the Lieutenant Governor may be absent.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott called attention to section 10 of Article IV of the Constitution: "Each
                House, when assembled, shall choose its own officers, the President of the Senate
                excepted."</p>
              <p>Mr. Chapman read from Cushing's Parliamentary law, page 124, chapter II, in which
                it is distinctly stated that the term of the President pro tem. expires with the
                return of the Lieutenant Governor to the chair.</p>
              <p>Mr. Orr took a view similar to the one presented by Mr. Chapman.</p>
              <p>The President, [Mr. Friedley of Lawrence in the chair], said: I owe it to myself to
                state that on the adjournment of the Senate, at noon, the Lieutenant Governor
                delivered to me his keys and said he supposed he would not be here this afternoon
                and probably not at all next week; and believing the occassion for which I was
                elected was his absence at any time during this session, I complied with his
                request, and called the Senate to order at two o'clock. But if there is any question
                on the subject I would not under any circumstances consent to occupy the chair.
                Therefore I ask leave of the Senate, if there is any question about this, to retire
                from the chair.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams had seen it frequently the case, that in the absence of the Lieutenant
                Governor some Senator was called to the Chair, but his term of service as Chairman
                always expired with the adjournment for the day.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott saw no prohibition against a proceeding of this kind, either in the
                Constitution or in the law of the State, and he thought it regular as long as the
                Senate recognizes the occupant of the Chair.</p>
              <p>Mr. Orr considered that the sixth rule of the Senate settled this question.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins asked leave to offer a resolution declaring the Hon George W.
                Friedley, President pro tem. of the Senate until the close of this session.</p>
              <p>Objection being made - </p>
              <p>Mr. Brown was clear that the proceedings had yesterday were regular. The Lieutenant
                Governor presides over this body in compliance with the twenty-first section of the
                fifth article of the Constitution. There is such a thing as electing a President of
                the Senate, and the contingency for such election arises as shown by the eleventh
                section of the same article. This officer exercises his functions whenever the
                Lieutenant Governor is acting as Governor, or whenever the Lieutenant Governor shall
                be unable to attend as President of the Senate. It clearly has reference to any time
                when the Lieutenant Governor is unable to attend to his duties in this
                character.</p>
              <p>Mr. Beeson stated that when he was a member of this body in 1858, Hon. A. A.
                Hammond was Lieutenant Governor of Indiana, and in the first or second week he
                stated to the Senate that he was so afflicted that he couldn't possibly attend to
                his duties, and the Senate proceeded to elect Mr. John R. Cravens as President pro
                tem. and on every occasion when Mr. Hammond was absent Mr. Cravens acted in his
                stead.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough considered if that action was not consistent with the provision of the
                Constitution, it ought not to be a precedent for our action. The constitution
                requires that a certain thing shall be done on a certain occasion. Section 11 of
                Article 5 says, "Whenever the Lieutenant Governor shall act as Governor, or be
                unable to attend as President of the Senate, the Senate shall elect one of its own
                members as President for the occasion." Now the Constitution requires that whenever
                the occasion occurs an election shall take place.</p>
              <p>Mr. Smith [Mr. Brown having been called to the chair] raised the point of order
                that there was nothing before the Senate.</p>
              <p>The Presiding Officer - I am going to make a rule now, and I trust some Senator
                will appeal from it. I decide that the election of the Hon. Senator from Lawrence
                (Mr. Friedley) is valid, and that he holds the office, and that in every absence of
                the Lieutenant Governor he is President of the Senate. He is a little delicate about
                the matter, but, in order to bring the matter before the Senate, I will decide that
                he is President of the Senate, and that he has the right to call any Senator to act
                in his stead as such, except when the Lieutenant Governor is here. If there is any
                doubt about the correctness of the decision, I will be glad to hear an appeal
                taken.</p>
              <p>Mr. Orr - I want to know by what authority the gentleman gets up there and makes
                that decision? [Laughter.]</p>
              <p>The Presiding Officer - The President of the Senate called me to the chair.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hall - I respectfully submit that the present occupant of the chair does not
                fulfill the exactions made in Cushing's Parliamentary Law; the Speaker ought to be
                religious, honest, grave, wise and discreet. [Laughter.]</p>
              <p>The Presiding Officer - I rule that out of order. [Renewed laughter.]</p>
              <p>Mr. Chapman and Mr. Hall appealed from the decision of the Chair.</p>

                impolitic, and that several bills amendatory of the act are now pending.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregg, from a minority of said committee, submitted a report recommending the
                passage of the bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. Daggy moved ineffectually to lay the minority report on the table. Yeas 16,
                nays 25.</p>
              <p>Mr. Neff was not hostile to the railroads but his people were decidedly in favor of
                repealing the railroad tax law.</p>
              <p>Mr. Daggy believed the majority in his district were in favor of retaining the law,
                and did not believe the people of the State want its repeal.</p>
              <p>Mr. Boone did not favor adopting the report of the minority of the committee,
                because the unconditional repeal of the law would place many districts of the State
                in a bad fix.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gooding thought an unconditional repeal of this law would involve many counties
                in litigation, little dreamed of by Senators on this floor. Senators who do not want
                railroads ought not to put it out of the power of those who do to get them. He hoped
                the minority report will not be adopted.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins would not let this matter pass without saying a word. In his part of
                the State there was perhaps more land held by non-residents than in any other
                Senatorial district in the State, and his people would vote in favor of retaining
                this law, by over two to one. Where one-half of such a tax has been paid, those who
                have not paid go scot free. As a rule, non-residents are the last to pay taxes, and
                the residents, therefore, having paid, the non-residents will get off and won't pay
                a cent. Properly guarded, the General Assembly never passed a law of more general
                benefit than this statute. The only way you can break down railroad monopoly is to
                grant liberal laws for their construction, and then properly restrict their tariffs
                for freights and passengers.</p>

                bill [S, 107] in relation to the qualifications of jurors, recommending its
                indefinite postponement.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown said that this bill had been placed in his hands by Gov. Baker last
                session, and he regarded it as a very good bill. It provides that no person shall be
                disqualified from acting as a juror on account of his opinions as to capital
                punishment. One class of persons believe that what God has given to man no man has
                the right to take away; and there is another class who believe in the old Mosaic
                doctrine that he who sheds man's blood his blood shall be shed in return. There
                should be in the courts no inquiry upon this subject. This is a question of no
                trivial importance, and he was surprised that the Judiciary Committee should propose
                to dispose of this bill in so summary a manner. He moved that the report be amended
                so as to lay the bill on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Boone favored concurring in the report of the Committee, for he thought the
                object of the bill was to do away with capital punishment entirely. This benevolent
                feature of the law has added to crime in this country, and nothing tends so to
                prevent high crime as the knowledge that severe punishment awaits it.</p>
              <p>Mr. Orr could not endorse the doctrine advanced by the Senator from Jackson, (Mr.
                Brown) but would vote for the motion because it is hard treatment to indefinitely
                postpone a bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown disavowed that there is anything in the bill proposing to abolish capital
                punishment, but it makes the practice in the criminal court in accord with the
                humane statute allowing imprisonment for life in high criminal cases.</p>
              <p>The motion to amend the report was agreed to.</p>
              <p>So The report lays on the table.</p>

          <p>Mr. Woodard, from the joint select committee thereon, submitted a report on the needs

            Secretary has not too thoroughly set forth, the neglect of the files in that office, and
            that further delay about the proper care of them will result in the loss or damage of
            valuable papers. They find that there is defect either in the law prescribing or in the
            negligence in performing, what is required in that office, where there is much important
            clerical work that should be required to be done They find large numbers of deeds,
            patents, charters, etc., involving original titles and rights of property in that office
            which are now practically inaccessible for want of indexes. They find that by
            legislation there has been a constant accumulation of diversified duties in this office
            which the clerical force have been unable to discharge. They also find that while the
            General Assembly have been constantly enlarging the duties of Secretary of State, it has
            made no increase of the clerical force or fees of the office, but it has even stripped
            the office of a fair compensation. The report concludes by referring the General
            Assembly to recommendations of the Governor and the report of the Secretary of State
            thereon, and by reporting a bill carefully digested and properly guarded for remedy of
            the evils pointed out, asking for it immediate and generous attention and an early
            passage, viz.: A bill [H. R. 391] further to prescribe the duties of Secretary of State,
            and providing for necessary arrangements, and for clerks, and the expenses of his
            office, (it proposes to divide the office of Secretary of State into four bureaus, viz.:

              the appraisement of real estate in all cities of 30,000 inhabitants or more, providing
              compensation and prescribing the duties of County Auditors therein.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kimball (in reply to Mr. Givan.) The object is to enable the city to do without
              Assessors; so that County Assessors may do the work.</p>
            <p>Mr. Givan. If it is for the purpose of doing away with the City Assessors and
              permitting the (bounty Assessors to do the assessing for city and county both, I think
              it may be a good law. We might thereby get a more uniform assessment.</p>
            <p>Mr. Miller. I move to refer it back to the Committee on Ways and Means, with
              instructions to strike out the "30,000 inhabitants" provision.</p>
            <p>Mr. Billingsley. It is to enable our county to take the city assessment, and apply it
              to the county assessment. It will save to the city of Indianapolis some three or four
              thousand dollars. It constitutes the City Assessor a member of the County Board of
              Assessors. If gentlemen wish for such a provision to apply to their counties, I am
              willing. As it is now, it is for the special benefit of the county of Marion.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ogdon proposed to amend the instructions (and Mr. Miller accepted), by striking
              out "30,000," and inserting these words: "all the cities and incorporated towns of the
              State."</p>
            <p>Mr. Branham. I would inquire, whether this bill provides that the city shall take the
              county assessment or the county the city assessment?</p>
            <p>Mr. Billingsley. The county shall take the city assessment.</p>
            <p>Mr. Branham. I would like it best the other way.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Walker, Mr. Ogden's motion was laid on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lenfestey and Mr. Mellett opposed the bill, the latter proposing to amend by
              striking out "city assessors'' and inserting "county assessors" in lieu.</p>
            <p>Mr. King. It will take the county assessors six weeks longer to make the assessments,
              not having the plats.</p>
            <p>Mr. Branham. It seems to me that the amendment is the present law.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shirley. Let the towns and cities accept the assessments made by the State.</p>
            <p>After further debate by Mr. Givan against mixing the State and city assessments, and
              by Mr. Walker in favor of the bill - </p>
            <p>Mr. Woollen. If it be true that the city assessments commence on the first of January
              and the assessments for the State on the first of April, then this bill should not be
              passed till we shall require their assessments to be made at the same time.</p>

            <p>Mr. Johnson's bill [H. R. 245] to provide for paroling prisoners who may be confined
              in the county jails for the nonpayment of any fine assessed against them for violation
              of any of the penal laws of the State, was taken up on the third reading.</p>
            <p>Mr. Johnson said the bill was prepared at the suggestion of Governor Baker. It was
              finally passed the House of Representatives - yeas, 61; nays, 16.</p>
            <p>Mr. Johnson's bill [H. R. 246] concerning the granting of pardons by the Governor
              [the Governor may grant pardons to Penitentiary prisoners revocable at his pleasure].
              Mr. J. said the bill was also prepared at the suggestion of Governor Baker - a
              suggestion resulting from his experience. Already in numerous instances have these
              pardons of prisoners been issued on conditions, but it is, perhaps, certain that the
              Governor could not enforce the condition. This bill is to do that. It is to authorize
              the Governor to do for <pb n="90" xml:id="VAA8558-14-090"/> the State's prisoners what
              the other bill, No. 245, authorizes him to do for the county jail prisoners.</p>
            <p>Mr. Miller opposed the hill. The result would be that the Governor would be annoyed
              by applications for pardon much more than he now is. It seems to me that the principle
              which underlies this whole matter of Executive pardon is wrong; for it depends not on
              the fact whether the conduct of the prisoner is meritorious or not, but on the fact of
              his having influential friends, a good looking wife, daughters, etc. I would much
              prefer to have the provisioning of the bill reported from the Committee on Reformatory
              Institutions, by which the length of the prisoner's term may depend on his behaviour
              while in confinement, and I would have this principle apply to those who are confined
              in the penitentiary for life.</p>
            <p>Mr. Branham. I am satisfied that the provisions of this bill are just and right. I
              suppose that we are all aware that we can't pass a law that can do any good without
              its being susceptible of abuse; and all the evil of this bill must grow out of the
              abuse of the power it confers.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mellett would like to except from its provisions those guilty of murder.</p>
            <p>Mr. Johnson supported the bill and Mr. Heller and Mr. Lenfestey opposed it.</p>

              <p>The Speaker next announced the consideration of Mr. Woollen's bill [H. R. 333]
                concerning divorces.</p>
              <p>The question being on the third reading thereof,</p>
              <p>Mr. Bowser desired unanimous consent to amend the bill so as to save pending
                actions for divorce.</p>
              <p>Mr. Woollen said : The proposed law does not save the cases now pending, because it
                was considered that it involves a question of morality, If it is right that we
                should change the divorce laws so as to change the causes for a divorce may be
                obtained, then it is not right to provide that divorces may be obtained for causes
                not included in the proposed law. We go upon the supposition that the law is wrong
                now, and that all actions for obtaining divorces should be striken down unless they
                come under the provisions of this act. I know very well that this is striking at
                some of my own private business as a lawyer; but while I am on this floor I shall
                vote for this bill as a representative of the people, and attend to my cases and
                clients as a lawyer, when I go home.After further debate, and further propositions
                to amend, in which Messrs. Hollingsworth, Smith, Woollen, Miller, Mellett, Wilson of
                Ripley, Shirley, Johnson, and Clark took part, the previous question pressure

            <p>Mr. Steele, by consent, introduced a bill [S. 265] for an act regulating the

              therewith, and declaring an emergency, which was read the first time.</p>

                Thompson's [S. 9] to increase the salaries of judges of the State.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved to postpone the consideration thereof till Wednesday next at two
                o'clock P. M.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele preferred to see the part referring to the salaries of supreme judges
                uncoupled from the rest of the bill. He thought it due to the Senate and the subject
                of the bill that it be acted upon at once.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins recognized the probability that if the bill were passed to a vote now
                that it would be defeated, while if the vote on its passage be delayed until after
                action is taken on the proposition to redistrict the State it will probably pass. At
                the request of Senators he withdrew his motion to postpone, that a trial vote may be
                had.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner moved to recommend the bill with instructions to strike out all that
                relates to Common Pleas judges.</p>
              <p>After remarks by Messrs. Glessner, Harney and Steele - </p>
              <p>Mr. Smith moved to amend the instructions by also striking out all that refers to
                the Circuit judges. He was in favor of the bill as it is, but made the motion to
                accommodate others.</p>
              <p>After remarks by Messrs. Neff, Thompson and O'Brien - </p>
              <p>Mr. Dittemore moved, ineffectually, to lay the motion to commit on the table - yeas
                17, nays 21.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. O'Brien, the bill and instructions were laid on the table.</p>

                water is taken for the use of any city, town or benevolent institution, was read the
                second time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Harney, if he understood the provisions of this bill, thought they were very
                summary in its operations.</p>
              <p>Mr. Howard thought the emergency clause should be stricken out.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott understood such amendments to the bill were made in committee as suited
                all parties, and caused opposition to be withdrawn.</p>
              <p>Mr. O'Brien stated that since the report was made it was agreed by the committee
                that the emergency clause should be stricken out. He made that motion.</p>
              <p>It was so ordered.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner moved to amend the bill by adding a clause providing that said water
                works are located above the limits of the city.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott contended that no body or corporation had a right to poison or render
                impure the waters of any stream. The waters of White river and every other river
                should be kept pure.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved an additional amendment by way of a proviso that the act shall
                not affect the rights of the owners of pork houses, manufacturing establishments,
                and other like improvements heretofore erected.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner accepted the amendment.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele was not prepared to vote for this bill as it is.</p>
              <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, as he understood the bill, favored its passage without
                these amendments. He did not recognize as a fact the idea that moneyed men -
                capitalists - have paramount interests in the streams and water courses of the
                States, and may do that which will injure the health of thousands of the citizens of
                Indiana. The people everywhere have an interest in keeping pure the streams of water
                of this commonwealth.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown regarded as a complete answer to all objections to this bill the simple
                statement that human beings have a natural right to the air they breathe and the
                water they drink, and no man has a right to impair the purity of either:
                consequently the turning in a stream of offal and poisonous matter violates that
                common right of the land. Streams should be protected from impurity for the use of
                the beasts as well as for the use of man. Man can not destroy these God given
                rights.</p>
              <p>Mr. Sleeth thought it the duty of legislation to protect capital, but it was a
                higher duty to protect the health and lives of the people. He contended that the
                adoption of these amendments would reverse the laws inforce for the past forty
                years, making most all the streams in the State public highways. Capital should not
                stand in the way of the health of the people.</p>

              recommending that it be indefinitely postponed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Reno supported the bill by such considerations as: that if I hire a man by the

              enforced the bill, which provides that members of the General Assembly shall be

              sheep-killing dogs, and providing that nothing herein shall conflict with the act of
              June, 1852, recommending that it be laid on the table. The report was concurred

            <p>Mr. Shirley, from the <orgName>Committee on Rights and Privileges</orgName>, returned
              Mr. Pfrimmer's bill [H. R. 335] regulating estrays and articles adrift, with

              for notice;" in section 11 strike out and insert "fifty cents each," and so amended
              the committee recommend its passage.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shirley. This bill requires the individual taking up the estray to make notice,
              obtain the appraisers, and in ten dayds after the taking up he must file the notice
              and apprasiements with the county clerk, and the bill requires him to hold the
              property but sixty days. Then the sheriff sells the property if it remains unclaimed
              just as he sells property under an execution; and after paying the damages the
              remainder, after one year, goes into the county fund. Under the law the party taking

              county seat. Another thing - the bill provides that when a man's trespassing animal,
              running at large, trespasses on another, the man that sustains the trespass notifies
              the owner of the animal, and if he pays no attention to it, he takes the animal up as
              an estray, and proceeds as provided in the bill. The amendments to the bill also make
              the appraisers fee fifty cents instead of two dollars - add the words "or affirm," and
              make the sheriff's fee "one dollar for selling and one dollar for notice."The

            <p>The first bill in order was Mr. Scott's bill, [S. 95] the consideration of which was
              pending at the time of adjournment last night. It is a bill to protect rivers,
              streams, or bodies of water from which water is taken for the use of cities, towns, or
              benevolent institutions. The question being on Mr. Glessner's amendment.</p>
            <p>Mr. Harney opposed and Mr. Scott favored its passage, the latter saying that in the
              course of some fifteen minutes stay on the banks of White river recently, he saw five
              wagon loads of refuse, from pork houses he supposed, emptied into the river, right
              where the water works, that supply this city with water, are situated. This bill would
              effectually stop such poisoning of streams of water in this State.</p>
            <p>It was referred to the <orgName>Committee on Rights and Privileges of the Inhabitants
                of the State</orgName>.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thompson's bill [S. 94] declaring that all fines and forfeitures collected in

              city, was read the second time. The bill was ordered engrossed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hubbard's bill [S. 96] to encourage manufacturing in the State, and legalizing
              the conveyances of real estate by and to foreign manufacturing companies, was read the
              second time and ordered to be engrossed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Glessner's bill [S. 27] to legalize certain acts of companies attempted to be
              organized under the general macadam and plank road laws, was read the second time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Glessner explained that it was to remedy any little defects in articles of
              association of road companies. It will hurt nobody and do injustice to no one. It does
              not apply to any gravel road built by assessing lands along its line, but only to
              those roads built by voluntary subscription.</p>
            <p>Mr. O'Brien moved to amend by adding a proviso that where legal proceedings have been
              commenced nothing in this act shall be construed as to affect such suits,
              engrossed.</p>

            <p>Mr. C. said the bill merely provides that the security shall recover from the

            <p>Mr. Collett's bill [S. 98] to prevent carrying concealed and dangerous weapons, was
              read the second time.</p>

              <p>The Speaker laid before the House a message from the Governor, submitting for
                consideration an act of Congress authorizing the erection of public buildings at
                Evansville, approved January 16, 1873, and calling the attention of the General
                Assembly to the condition on which that act is to have the force of law, viz: That
                the State of Indiana shall duly relinquish her right to tax the site of such public
                buildings, and relinquish her jurisdiction over the same - the Governor recommending
                legislation for this purpose.</p>
              <p>Mr Branham said there is now a bill pending which covers all these questions by
                general law. All that is necessary to do is to pass that bill and it would settle
                the question of jurisdiction, not only as to that site but as to every other similar
                application for a site for United States public buildings.</p>
              <p>The Speaker. The act of Congress requires a special act of legislation on that
                subject. Whereupon,</p>
              <p>Mr. Riggs (by unanimous consent) introduced a bill [H. R. 315] granting the consent
                of the State of Indiana to the purchase by the United States of certain lands for
                public buildings in the city of Evansville (not exceeding one acre) for a Government
                postoffice, the State to relinquish the right to tax the same, and to relinquish
                jurisdiction over the same till the United States shall cease to be the owner
                thereof; and so as the State retains the concurrent jurisdiction with the United
                States for all the purposes of the execution of legal process, excepting so far as
                such process may affect the United States. The message and bill were referred to the
                  <orgName>Committee on Federal Relations</orgName>.</p>

              <p>The Speaker now returned to the unfinished business of the morning session, to-wit:
                the consideration of the bill [S. 6] to regulate and make uniform the prices charged
                by railroad companies for transporting goods, wares, merchandise and other property
                to and from stations on railroads in the State of Indiana. The question being on Mr.
                Billingsley's motion to lay the bill on the table and print, to make it the special
                order for Tuesday and Thursday.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregory moved, ineffectually, to lay these propositions on the table.</p>
              <p>And then the bill was postponed and made the special order for Tuesday at two
                o'clock P. M., and ordered to be printed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Offutt submitted an amendment to the bill, which was read and ordered to be
                printed with the bill. It is to the following effect: In all actions arising, under
                the provisions of this act against any railroad company, it shall be sufficient to
                bring the action against the railroad as defendant, whether run by assignment to
                other persons or not, the service of summons being at least ten days before the
                first day of the term of the court before which it is to be heard; and if the
                hearing be before a justice of the peace, then the summons shall be served at least
                ten days before the trial; and such summons may be served upon any conductor of any
                train on said road.</p>

              <p>The Speaker laid before the House a message from the Governor transmitting a
                communication from James W. Meacham relative to the culture of fish in the great
                lakes - a question deemed by that gentleman to be of great public propriety in
                legislation; and the Governor asks attention thereto.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregory. I move that there be printed 300 copies of the bill from the Michigan
                Legislature which comes with these papers from the Governor.</p>
              <p>Mr. Butterworth proposed to include all the documents in the order to print.</p>
              <p>These motions were rejected, and then on the motion of Mr. Kimball, the message and

                the capitol. It was concurred in by unanimous consent, on the part of the House of

              <p>Mr. Steele, Chairman of the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned Mr.
                Orr's bill [S. 104] on the subject of the repeal of the gravel and plank road acts,
                with a recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Orr said there was no law on the statute books that produces more ill feeling
                among his neighbors than the gravel road law. He moved to amend the report by
                recommending that this bill lie on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregg concurred in the opinion that no worse law was on the statute book; but
                this bill proposes to legalize a part of the wrongs already perpetrated under the
                odious law, and for this latter reason he favored concurrence in the report of the
                committee. He did not think this a proper time to discuss the merits or demerits of
                the gravel road law.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele explained that his committee make such a report upon no bill that should
                become a law on the statute books. A concurrence in such a report effectually
                disposes of a bill, and so the Senate is not further troubled with it.</p>
              <p>Mr. Slater understood that a recent decision of the Supreme Court renders such a
                bill as this unnecessary, and therefore he favored the report of the committee.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner did not like this bill. The gravel road law in many parts of the
                State, the people can not get along without. The motion to amend the committee's
                report was rejected by yeas 16, nays 31, and the report of the committee concurred
                in.</p>

            <p>The President took the chair at two o'clock, and stated the question to be on the
              adoption of Mr. Boone's joint resolution [S. 9] introduced just before the recess.</p>
            <p>Mr. Glessner favored the object of the resolution, but thought the subject matter
              should be embraced in a bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. Neff moved that the resolution be referred to the special committee appointed
              last session to examine into that matter. [Messrs. Brown, Daggy and Dittemore.]</p>
            <p>Mr. Boone had no feeling about it, and was satisfied for the present with having
              brought the subject to the attention of the Senate.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved to amend the motion by changing the reference to the
                <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> that the question raised by Mr. Glessner may
              be examined into.</p>
            <p>Mr. Neff accepted this as a substitute for his motion.</p>
            <p>The resolution was so referred by yeas 28, nays 8.</p>
            <p>Mr. Carnahan moved that all claims reported on favorably from the <orgName>Committee
                on Claims</orgName> be referred to the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName>, with
              instructions to place them in the Specific Appropriation bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. Daugherty, from the <orgName>Committee on Reformatory Institutions</orgName>,
              returned the bill [H. R. 212] defining the misdemeanor of keeping houses of ill fame,
              etc., with amendments.</p>
            <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
            <p>On his further motion, the bill was read the second time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dittemore moved to further amend by striking out of the 2d section the words "as
              a means of livlihood."</p>
            <p>Mr. Hall hoped the bill would be passed without amendment.</p>
            <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dittemore moved to further amend the 2d section by inserting the words "be
              imprisoned in the county jail not exceeding six months," instead of confinement in the
              State's prison. </p>
            <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
            <p>Mr. Fuller moved to further amend by providing that the provisions of this act shall
              only apply to cities of 3,000 inhabitants and over. ,On motion of Mr, Hall, the
              amendment was laid on the table by yeas, 23; nays, 17.</p>
            <p>On motion by Mr. Brown, the amendments were ordered engrossed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Daggy moved that the Sonate proceed with the consideration of House bills on the
              third reading, but changed his motion at the suggestion of Mr. Slater, so that Senate
              bills may be considered - an exception being made in favor of the bill H. R. 211, at
              the instance of Mr. Beeson.</p>
            <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>

              <p>The bill [H. R. 211] supplemental to the act establishing a Female Reformatory
                [appropriating $50,000 for finishing the building and putting in order the grounds
                adjacent thereto] was read the third time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Winterbotham moved to recommit the bill to the Committee on Prisons, with
                instructions to strike out $50,000 and insert in lieu $25,000.</p>
              <p>Mr. Beeson resisted the motion, and urged the immediate passage of the bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, considering the present condition of the State Treasury,
                thought It prudent to get along with a less amount than $50,000, if possible. Then
                he doubted whether the State would be satisfied five years hence with the
                expenditure on this institution.</p>
              <p>Mr. Oliver hoped the Senate will pass this bill, as many workmen or contractors
                have laid out of their money for several months, and they should be paid.</p>
              <p>Mr. Winterbotham understood there were but twenty-three women in the State Prison,
                and thought this institution was costing too much money for the number of inmates it
                is likely to have.</p>
              <p>Mr. Beeson stated that the putting in one prison the two sexes is a thing very much
                to be regretted. In this building there is to be two separate departments. A prison
                department and a reformatory department for young and erring women. As a mechanical
                structure, the building is one of the best built the State has ever had. If the
                appropriation is cut down, as proposed, the structure will stand unoccupied for
                another two years. In the name and for the sake of humanity he hoped the bill would
                be passed without further amendment.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele is told by such men as Governor Baker that this institution will require
                an appropriation of $50,000. He hoped the amount would not be decreased; it calls
                more loudly for an appropriation than anything that has yet come before the
                Senate.</p>
              <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, was willing to appropriate enough money to pay on the
                indebtedness on the building:, but he believed so large an appropriation as $50,000
                would leave the State with insufficient means to make the necessary appropriations
                to other benevolent institutions now in successful operation.</p>
              <p>Mr. Slater reminded the Senate that tax payers were demanding economy, and he
                should oppose the appropriation.</p>
              <p>Mr. Neff proposed to amend the motion by inserting $30,000 instead of $25,000.</p>
              <p>Mr. Winterbotham accepted this amendment.</p>
              <p>The amendment was rejected, by - yeas, 15; nays, 25.</p>
              <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, moved to recommit the bill to the same committee, with
                instructions to strike out $50,000, and insert in lieu 25,000.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Wadge, this motion to refer was laid on the table, by - yeas, 22;
                nays, 19.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough moved to refer, with instructions to strike out $50,000 and insert
                $40,000.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Daugherty, it was laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins demanded the previous question, and mere bring a second, under its
                operations the bill finally passed, by - yeas, 27; nays, 13.</p>
              <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, and Mr. Neff, Mr. Orr and Mr. Winterbotham regretted
                their negative votes, but believe the bill appropriates more money than is
                necessary.</p>
              <p>Mr. Bowman's bill [S. 50] to correct and define the boundary line between the
                counties of Washington and Clark was read the third time and passed by yeas 38, nays
                0.</p>
              <p>Mr. Collett's bill [S. 75] defining the law of verbal slander, and affixing the
                penaly therefor, was read the third time and failed to pass for want of the
                constitutional majority of 26 - yeas 19, nays 19.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner and Mr. Steele explained their negative vote, believing it would
                encourage actions for slander, and, as such, is a dangerous measure.</p>
              <p>Mr. Collett's bill [S. 76] defining the law and crime of libel was read the third
                time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Slater denounced it as a bill striking against newspapers, and very unjust in
                its provisions.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough moved to recommit the bill to the committee, with instructions to strike
                out that portion of the bill providing for imprisonment.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Wadge, the motion to refer was laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown declared that this was not a bill striking at newspapers unless they
                ought to be struck at. The many abuses of personal character now prevalent ought to
                be stopped. Any written or printed slander made public is as much a libel as though
                published in a newspaper. The bill says to editors of newspapers that their
                publications shall be circumscribed by the rules of decency and truth.</p>
              <p>After remarks by Messrs. Brown, Slater, Gregg, Gooding, Hough and Dwiggins, which
                will appear in the Brevier Legislative Reports - </p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved to recommit the bill to the <orgName>Judiciary
                  Committee</orgName>with instructions to more definitely define the offense.</p>
              <p>After further debate by Messrs. Brown and Rhodes - </p>
              <p>Mr. Rhodes moved to amend the instructions by moving to strike out the third
                section.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele moved to change the reference to the <orgName>Committee on Rights and
                  Privileges</orgName>.</p>
              <p>Mr. Daugherty demanded the previous question. The Senate seconded the demand.</p>
              <p>The motions to refer were both severally rejected, and under the operations of the
                previous question the bill was rejected by yeas 16, nays 19.The Senate then

              <head rend="center">STATE GEOLOGIST - SURVEYS.</head>
              <p>Mr. Thayer, from the <orgName>Committee on Manufacturing and Commerce</orgName>,
                returned his bill [H. R. 303] to amend sections 6 and 7of the act to provide for
                geological surveys - for the collection and preservation of geological and
                mineralogical cabinets, ets., (proposing the appropriation of 810,000 lor the State
                Geologist arid for those other purposes,) recommending its passagethe bill being on
                its second reading, it was read.</p>
              <p>Mr. Butterworth. I think this bill will bear discussion. The State has been
                appropriating $5,000 annually for geological surveys and those purposes; and we all
                know the State han obtained very respectable surveys and reports. Now it is proposed
                to double the amount of that appropriation - and the question is, should we do it?
                No man can speak in higher terms of commendation of the State Geologist than I would
                be willing to speak and to endorse; and I confess that his salary ought to be
                increased. But excepting a few counties west, the State has little interest in these
                geological surveys. The counties east and north have no great interest in them. I
                move therefore to amend the bill by striking out $10,000 and inserting $6,000 in its
                place.</p>
              <p>Mr. Baker opposed the amendment.</p>
              <p>Mr. Furnas showed that by increasing the amount of taxable property in the State,
                these geological surveys have been the occasion of bringing in an increase of the
                taxes collected to the amount of $60,000; and when gentlemen consider this
                augmentation of the taxes, they can not fail to be interested in this work. Now,
                sir, if you take away that appropriation, you will cripple these surveys. I consider
                this one of the best investments the State has ever made. Hitherto the Geologist's
                pay has been but a nominal thing, and now we propose to pay him for what he has
                done, and for continuing the work. The bill should pass without amendment.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brett was opposed to any increase of the appropriation for these surveys. I am
                from one of the counties supposed to be interested in them, and I think more has
                been developed there by practical men in the mines, without costing the State a
                single dollar, than has been developed by all the geologists put together. It has
                been the work of practical men. I do not underrate the Geologist, but I do oppose
                the raising of the taxes for salaries and other public expenses; and unless we put
                our foot on this thing, the people of the State will be ground to the earth by
                taxation. I am willing that these officers should be paid a reasonable amount, but I
                very much doubt the propriety of raising the Geologists salary, or continuing this
                annual appropriation. l am opposed to the appropriation recommended by the
                committee. I know their recommendations are honestly made; but they hear ex parte
                statements only - statements on one side of the question. But gentlemen ought to
                bear in mind the greatly increased expenses that are to come upon the people during
                the next two years; and for that reason, if for no other, I am opposed to the
                increase of expenses at the present time in this direction.</p>
              <p>Mr. Woodard. It is a matter of economy to increase this appropriation. The
                Geologist has brought in the taxes to an amount more than ten-fold of the amount of
                his compensation. Other States pay more for this work than we do. The
                representatives of the people ought to be liberal in this direction, for the further
                development of our mineral resources.</p>
              <p>Mr. Furnas spoke as having some little familiarity with the office of State
                Geologist; and to those who visit his office it is not an unusual thing for the
                Doctor to introduce capitalists from Europe, representing hundreds of thousands of
                dollars. These capitalists are calling on him almost every day looking for
                information as to the character of our coal mines, asking for reports on that
                subject. It seems to me that the gentleman from Daviess (Mr. Brett) can not have
                informed himself as to this, and I am obliged to say that his practical men down
                there have done almost nothing for the development of the mining interests in
                comparison with what these surveys have done. There is not a capitalist that does
                not consult the State Geologist before making his investments in the mines.</p>
              <p>Mr. Mellett. It has been but a few hours since a bill was voted down here for
                taxing the entire State for school funds, because the House preferred that the
                people should be taxed locally. Now, it does appear to me that this appropriation is
                more local in its operation than any proposition can be for the advancement of our
                system of common schools. It is a fact that our geological developments have been a
                great source of public benefit - no one will question thatno one will question that
                Prof. Cox deserves great credit for his labors in this service. But the benefits of
                it have been received and enjoyed in a special manner by particular localities in
                the State. The wealth and business of the city of Indianapolis, and of the coal
                regions, have been benefited by his labors more than all other sections of the
                State. And as to his compensation, I am aware that he has received, besides what he
                gets from the State, substantial testimonials for his successful labors and
                researches in the mines. I am informed that his salary is now $1,000 more than State
                pays him - paid to him by the miners and others in that interest. There is nothing
                wrong in this; and I mention it because I have no doubt in the world that this great
                interest will take care of him.</p>
              <p>Mr. Butterworth now withdrew his former motion and submitted this amendment in
                lieu. Strike out $10,000 and insert $6,000; strike out $3,000 and insert $2,500.</p>
              <p>Mr. Reed. I hope this amendment will not prevail. I happen to represent a portion
                of the State largely interested in these surveys, and in the developments that have
                been made under the direction of this officer. I think that regard- <pb n="106"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-14-106"/> less of every local consideration, the State should
                place this officer upon a footing that will enable him to carry out the work that
                has been so prosperously begun. I remember some of the results growing out of his
                investigations. The very first thing that brought the attention of capitalists to
                the southern end of the State grew out of these geological reports; and I think I am
                justified in saying that more than a million of dollars have been thrown into the
                southern portion of the State in this way. Four years ago this idea of our mineral
                wealth was thought to be visionary - it was then when Prof. Cox came into our county
                and found not only coal of a very fine quality, but iron also; and to-day we have an
                iron furnace in our county in successful operation. I was a little surprised at the
                position taken by the gentleman from Daviess, (Mr. Bretl) for we all know that these
                iron manufacturing interests were almost without experiment amongst us up to the
                time of the commencement of these scientific investigations. Gentlemen may talk
                about the value of the efforts of practical men - they are well enough in their
                places, but the benefits of their labors are not scattered broad cast over the
                world. They do not carry with them the force of scientific investigations made by
                competent men - men who are known all over the country as skillful and learned, and
                knowing whereof they speak.</p>
              <p>Mr. Butterworth's amendment was adopted on a division - affirmative 33, negative 24
                - and the question recurred on the engrossment.</p>
              <p>Mr. Mellett proposed to amend the bill so as to make the annual appropriation
                $6,000, and the salary $3,000.</p>
              <p>Mr. North did not think the amendment should prevail.</p>
              <p>Mr. Kimball understood that the appropriation of $10,000 in this bill covers all
                expenses for geologist and surveys, and the gentleman's amendment, therefore,
                reduces the amount only $1,000. If this service is worth $9,000, it is worth
                $10,000. There is no man but knows that every relation in business life has been
                benefited more than live times that amount by the Geologist every year of his
                service. Gentlemen may say that this work has been helped forward by the miners -
                which is very true - but until these resources were developed by the investigations
                of the State Geologist, this additional capital did not come into the State. If
                gentlemen are in earnest about legislating for the best interests of the State, let
                them do something that will bring results, and not waste time here in debate day
                after day, and when we come to any real practical matter vote it down. I think the
                people will condemn the man that stands in the way of such an effort as this to
                develop the State's resources. I will not detain the House by going into details of
                a matter so well known as the fact that the great interests of the State have been
                developed more by the work of the State Geologist than by that of any other man.</p>
              <p>Mr. Butterworth was sorry to differ from the honorable gentleman, who speaks with
                so much energy about the people condemning us; but the facts remain that this
                Legislature, has done too much in the way of extravagance by following in the lead
                of the gentleman from Marion. This appropriation is not for one year, it is an
                annual appropriation. We should remember, sir, that we are living in the times of a
                fluctuating currency - think of $800,000,000 of currency worth eighty cents on the
                dollar. We will have to come down to something better than that. I might be willing
                to make salary $3,000, for Prof. Cox has done well, but I will not say he has done
                all that has been done for the State. This matter is the outgrowth of the times. It
                would have been about as it is if the State had been without the geologists. There
                is a good deal of humbug about these geologists. Sir, what miner, what citizen has a
                particle interest in that map? [he held a map in his hand]; yet there are thousands
                or these maps published at the expense of the State. I insist that $3,000 is perhaps
                more than we ought to give to the geologist; and that would afford him ample means
                to do even a greater amount of work than he has done in years past. And I know, and
                God knows (two good witnesses are enough to establish the fact,) that the geologist
                has done enough to justify our expectations.</p>
              <p>Mr. Kimball. The gentleman charges me with being in the lead as to the expenditure
                of the public money. If that is so I am proud of it, for there has not been an
                appropriation made by this legislature that will not result in the general good.
                Economy is econony; and in order to be benefited by economy we should economize in
                the right direction. The gentleman holds up a map here, and objects to its cost, and
                says we are not legislating here for Indianapolis and the men in the coal mines, but
                for the State of Indiana. Now, although that map may not benefit the gentleman from
                St. Joseph county, and others with him on the northern border of the State; yet that
                map, sir, shows to the world that here, in the State of Indiana, are these great
                mineral deposits; and without it foreign capitalists would not know, perhaps, where
                to go to invest their money in those manufactories that are growing up and should be
                fostered by the State; and as the waves of the waters are supplied by the ripplings
                from the rocks, so will these great resources of wealth reach even to St. Joseph
                county and every other part of the State.</p>
              <p>Mr. Johnson concurred in the remark of the gentleman from St. Joseph about the
                inadequate pay of educators in the schools, who work as hard as the geologist, with
                $1,000 to $1,500 a year compensation. The Judges, many of them, for $1,500 a year.
                The Judges of the Circuit Court for $2,000 a year. The Judges of the Supreme Court,
                working all the time, with a salary of $5,000. And it has been only within a few
                weeks that the Governor of the State has been receiving more than that. Now, while
                we would do justice to the good man, we ought not to be unjust to others. If we
                raise the salary of the Geologist to $3,600, the Judges of the Supreme Court ought
                to have $6,000, and the Judges of the Circuit Courts ought to hove $3,600, as well
                as the Geologist. I have nothing to say against the gentleman who fills the place of
                State Geologist. But it has been well said that this State must raise an enormous
                sum of money in the next two years. There is no question that we can secure these
                services of the geologist at less cost than three thousand dollars. It would be
                unjust toward other men to. put this salary at $3,000. While we undertake to do
                justly let us do even handed justice. My own impression is that $2,500 for this
                place would be about equal, but I will go as far as $3,000, if that should be the
                pleasure of the House. But if we put it at $2,500 I think the present officer would
                be satisfied.</p>
              <p>Mr. King moved ineffectually to lay the amendment on the table - yeas 34, nays
                49.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregory proposed to amend the amendment so as to make the geologist's salary
                $2,500.</p>
              <p>Mr. Branham. I think it is evident to all by this time, that this matter has been
                sprung upon the House at this time unawares. I am satisfied gentlemen have not
                sufficiently considered the matter, to determine what ought to be the salary of the
                Geologist. I am willing to vote for a reasonable amount for this purpose, but not so
                as to be unjust to other officers of the State. I am in favor of giving every
                officer of the State a fair salary. Therefore, for the purpose of giving us time to
                think over it, and agree upon something that will be just and satisfactory, I move
                to lay the bill and pending amendment on the table.</p>

                object as heretofore described in this day's proceedings, and moved ineffectually

              <p>On motion by Mr. Chapman, the house concurrent resolution for dividing the State
                into three Insane Hospital districts, and providing for the erection of buildings
                and the government of the same, etc., was read.</p>
              <p>Mr. O'Brien opposed the idea of creating the paraphernalia of two additional
                benevolent institutions, especially in view of the complaint that the treasury was
                being rapidly depleted. And he opposed the scattering of these institutions all over
                the State.</p>
              <p>Mr. Daggy also opposed three separate institutions, but would favor the erection of
                additional buildings on the Insane Hospital grounds near this city - one devoted
                more particularly to males and one to females.</p>
              <p>Mr. Oliver desired Senators to think seriously about this subject - it is a
                colossal question - one around which cluster the very greatest interest. He favored
                the erection of additional buildings on the present hospital grounds.</p>
              <p>After debate by Messrs. Chapman, Glessner and Dwiggins - </p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved to refer the resolution to the Committee on Benevolent
                Institutions, with instructions to inquire and report what amount should be
                appropriated to build additional buildings for the insane, and also report where
                such additional buildings should be erected, and all other matters pertaining
                thereto, and report by bill or otherwise.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough moved to amend the amendment by directing the committee to inquire into
                the necessity for the erection of additional buildings on the present site of the
                Hospital for the Insane.</p>
              <p>After further debate by Messrs. Hough, Hall and Steele, Mr. O'Brien offered a
                substitute instructing the committee to inquire into the propriety of enlarging the
                present buildings for the accommodation, of the insane of the State, or the building
                of new buildings on the ground now owned by the State, and report plans and
                specifications for said buildings.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott demanded the previous question. The Senate seconded the demand. The

              <p>The question then recurring on the amendment (Mr. Dwiggins') it was agreed to

              <p>The concurrent resolution as amended was adopted by yeas, 37; nays, 9.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Rhodes, his bill [S. 157] authorizing the purchase of stationery
                for county officers and courts, was ordered to be engrossed for the third

              <p>On motion by Mr. Gregg, his bill [S. 4] in regard to taxing the State national

              <head rend="center">ROAD SUPERVISORS.</head>
              <p>Mr. Slater's bill [S. 128] to amend section 1 of the supervisor of highways act,
                approved March 5,1859, being read the second time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Slater explained that the bill simply changes the mode of electing supervisors
                from a general election to the road district at the same time they elect school
                directors, on the first Saturday in October.</p>
              <p>Mr. Cave doubted the propriety of the passage of ihis bill. He feared the election
                of supervisors would pretty generally go by default. </p>
              <pb n="110" xml:id="VAA8558-14-110"/>
              <p>Mr. Neff favored the bill, believing it would work well in many respects. Every
                district ought to be allowed to select its own supervisor.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins suggested a difficulty - there is no provision in the bill for
                certifying the election to the Township Trustee.</p>
              <p>Mr. Slater moved the reference of the bill to a select committee of three, with
                instructions to perfect it. The President made the committee to consist of Messrs.
                Slater, Cave and Bunyan.</p>
              <p>Several Senators asking for leave of absence - </p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Steele, a call of the Senate was had, discovering thirty-eight
                Senators present.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dittemore, by consent, offered a resolution, which was adopted, rescinding the
                leave of absence heretofore granted the Senator from Franklin, and directing the
                Secretary to inform him of the passage of this resolution.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hall, from the select committee thereon, returned Mr. Dittemore's bill [S.
                1481, providing the manner of re-locating county seats, with amendments.</p>
              <p>Mr. Neff believed the only fair way was to submit this question of the removal of
                county seats to a vote of the people, and not to a petition.</p>
              <p>The report was concurred in.</p>

            <p>Mr. Hall would not consent to the entertainment of such a motion when so many seats
              were empty. He indicated his intention to demand a call of the Senate, whereupon Mr.
              Dittemore withdrew his motion.</p>

              "Provided that no female shall be imprisoned,"] was read the second time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Harvey and Mr. Boone favored this bill, and Mr. Brown, Mr. Thompson and Mr.
              Steele opposed it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bunyan moved to indefinitely postpone the bill. The motion was agreed to by yeas

              <p>Mr. Walker proposed to amend the bill by striking out lines 22 to 25 in section
                one; and by striking out section three. What I desire is simply to leave the Senate
                without pages for their principal and assistant secretaries and without their pages
                or their messengers for their Committees - strike out all except the two.</p>
              <p>Mr. Johnson called for the reading of the bill as proposed to be amended.</p>

              <p>The amendments were adopted, and then the amendments were ordered to be engrossed

              <p>Mr. Kimball, from the <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>, returned to
                the House Mr. Givan's bill; [H. R. 60] to provide for the assessment and collection
                of taxes for municipal purposes on the shares of stocks owned in banks and banking
                associations doing business in this State, with a recommendation that it be laid on
                the table, which was concurred in.</p>
              <p>Mr. Baker submitted a preamble and resolution reciting that the general tax
                assessment law passed at the last session has not yet been sufficiently published;
                and the printed copies thereof being exhausted, the Secretary of State is hereby
                instructed to contract for the printing of 5,000 additional copies of <pb n="112"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-14-112"/> said act, to be by him distributed amongst those
                entitled to receive the same in the several counties and towns of the State. He said
                there were 5,000 copies of that act printed under the former order, and they have
                all been exhausted, and there is a demand for them by the business men and others in
                all parts of the State; and because the law was passed with an emergency clause, it
                is certainly our duty to supply this demand.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gifford. The Secretary of State has made the request that 5,000 copies more be
                printed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brett. All the officers who are required to act under the provisions of that
                law must have been supplied, for there was a sufficient number printed. The bulk of
                the matter of the act Sias reference simply to the provisions for its enforcements;
                therefore, he should oppose this order for additional copies.</p>
              <p>Mr. Baker. The reports distributed have been sent only to the county officers. The
                people ought to have this law in their own hands; the radical changes which it makes
                in the assessments demands that we should supply the people with it. I understand
                that the matter is yet in type, and it will be but a small expense to get these
                additional copies.</p>
              <p>Mr. Thompson, of Elkhart, stated his information that there are but twenty-four
                copies remaining of the former order, and he knew that copies of the act were
                demanded by business men in his region.</p>
              <p>Mr. Shirley expressed his opposition to the passage of the resolution.</p>
              <p>Messrs. Lenfesty, Cobb, , Billiugsley and Glassgow supported it.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brett suggested further that it was made the duty of the assessors to furnish
                the taxpayers with their estimates in blanks; that the greater portion of the tax
                assessment law has reference to the details prescribing the duties of the assessors
                and the collection officers, in which, of course, the people have no interest. All
                the information the tax-payer would require will be found in these blanks of the
                assessors. And besides this, the assessors do not commence until the first of April,
                and by that time copies of the law itself will be in the hands of the people in
                considerable numbers. And unless it were for the purpose of giving the printer a
                job, he could not see the demand for this resolution.</p>
              <p>Mr. Mellett and Mr. Blocher spoke further in favor of the adoption of the
                resolutions.</p>
              <p>Mr. Cobb proposed to amend the resolution by striking out the words, "to the
                several counties and towns," and inserting words so as to make the order to require
                that these copies "be furnished to members of the General Assembly for
                distribution,"</p>
              <p>Mr. Baker accepted the modification.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gifford moved to lay the amendment on the table, but it was accepted.</p>
              <p>Mr. Ogden proposed to amend the resolution toy striking out and inserting so as to
                make this order for distribution by the county auditors of the several counties of
                the State, which was agreed to; and so the resolution was adopted.</p>

              <head rend="center">WABASH AND ERIE CANAL - </head>
              <p> Mr. Cauthorn submitted a joint resolution relative to the agreement between the
                Stales of Indiana and Ohio on the subject of the Wabash and Erie Canal.</p>
              <p>The resolution recites and states that the only contract entered into by the State
                of Indiana on account of the Wabash and Erie Canal with the State of Ohio is
                contained in the joint resolution of February 1, 1834; that the State of Indiana
                never promised to keep in repairs that portion of the Canal which is in the
                jurisdiction of the State of Ohio, etc., and that the Governor transmit a copy of
                this resolution to the General Assembly of the State of Ohio without delay.</p>
              <p>Mr. Kimball. The army and navy of the United States, I understand, is in good
                condition, if the Governor should be called upon to defend the State against our
                aggressive neighbors, I see no necessity for the reference.</p>
              <p>Mr. Schmuck. The gentleman from Marion has been a General and he might be expecting
                a military appointment.</p>
              <p>Mr. Cauthorn. We all know that Governor Baker communicated to the General Assembly
                the joint resolution of the State of Ohio, of 1871, with reference to this matter,
                and recommended a, certain course to be pursued, which ought to have been acted on
                before this. This Ohio resolution assumed certain liabilities in relation to the
                Wabash and Erie Canal, which are not sustained by the record. He proceeded to
                rehearse the history of the whole matter. It was some time prior to 1834 that the
                State of Indiana determined to build a canal to connect our rivers with the waters
                of Lake Erie, and passed a Joint resolution for Congress to authorize the survey;
                and the Congress of the United States, in 1834, authorized the State of Indiana to
                make the survey. That canal, if constructed would necessarily go through a portion
                of the State of Ohio; and from that time it was thought proper that the State of
                Indiana should build that canal; and Congress passed an act granting to the States
                of Indiana and Ohio certain donations of land for the purpose. The State of Ohio
                accepted the grant, signifying her readiness to make the canal within her border.
                Indiana also accepted and proposed to construct her portion on such terms and
                conditions as might be devised by a commission duly ratified by the two States; and
                here is where the misunderstanding rests. There was a commission appointed on the
                part of the two States to consider and report propositions on the matter; upon which
                commission Judge Sullivan was appointed on the part of the State of Indiana, and a
                Mr. Siliman on the part of the State of Ohio. But by the terms of the act
                authorizing this commission, it was expressly stipulated that their action should
                not be final. They were simply to make or draft an agreement between the two States;
                but that agreement was never ratified by our State. Therefore, the agreement made by
                these commissioners was not, in any sense, a contract between the two States. It was
                nothing but the act of Individual men. But afterwards the General Assembly of Ohio
                passed a joint resolution, on the 27th of January, 1834, which was transmitted to
                the General Assembly of Indiana, whereupon a joint resolution was passed here - the
                only one that ever bound the State of Indiana in this matter - in which the State of
                Indiana accepts and adheres to the grant of land by Congress. But the agreement
                between Sullivan and Siliman was not binding, because never ratified by the State.
                The only thing that binds the State of Indiana is that joint resolution of Feb. 1,
                1834, in which we required conditions and made stipulations which were afterwards
                accepted. The State of Ohio assumed a liability in this matter, but Indiana did not.
                As to the assumption in this joint resolution of the State of Ohio that the State of
                Indiana agreed by her commissioners to keep open that canal, he referred to Governor
                Baker's statement and reasoning thereon, as conclusive; and, therefore, he had
                thought it proper, by way of the Joint resolution, he had now offered, to tell the
                State of Ohio that they have gone out of the recordto put in a general denial. The
                resolution is drafted simply in accordance with the recommendations of Governor
                Baker.</p>
              <p>Mr. Lenfesty. That joint resolution of the General Assembly of Ohio was referred to
                the <orgName>Committee on Federal Relations,/; and we had drafted resolutions
                  similar to those offered by the gentleman from Knox. While he would not, perhaps,
                  admit the intimation, if it were the remark of another, he might be ready here,
                  for himself, to admit that the Committee on Fed- <pb n="113"
                    xml:id="VAA8558-14-113"/> eral Relations have evinced less promptitude and
                  readiness to serve the State in this matter than the gentleman from Knox. But this
                  matter has been before the committee, and, with them, it has been thought best to
                  be a little, careful in this matter, so as not to give offense. He had not found
                  anything offensive or threatening in the resolution from the State of Ohio. It is
                  entirely courteous; and the insinuations of the gentleman to the contrary, he
                  thought, should not be ratified here. The committee did not wish to act hastily in
                  the matter, thinking that their resolutions could be reported and adopted at any
                  convenient time. He was entirely willing that this resolution should be adopted -
                  knowing it to be right - because it conies from the gentleman from Knox, and it
                  would be improper that this honor, which is due to the gentlemen from Knox, should
                  be divided between that gentleman and the Committee on Federal Relations. If the
                  House understands the resolutions, and is assured that they are all correct, they
                  might as well be adopted this morning as at any other time, and it is scarcely
                  supposable or reasonable that the committee should be called upon to examine
                  them.</orgName></p>
              <p>Mr. Cauthorn. In justice to myself and to the <orgName>Committee on Federal
                  Relations</orgName>, I think now that this subject should be referred. I was not
                in the House when the message of Governor Baker was considered in <orgName>Committee
                  of the Whole</orgName>. If I had known that this subject was specially referred to
                the <orgName>Committee on Federal Relations</orgName>, I should not have moved in
                this matter. But since the gentleman takes it to heart, I am willing - and I very
                much prefer - that the resolutions should be committed to the <orgName>Committee on
                  Federal Relations</orgName>.</p>
              <p>Mr. Lenfesty. It will do no good. If the House is prepared, better to pass the
                resolutions at once. The committee would not feel at liberty to mar them with
                amendments, or substitute other resolutions; and perhaps it would not be corteous to
                change the resolutions at all.</p>

              <p>Mr. Mellett. I wish to say one word to a question personal to myself. I am reported
                in the Sentinel of this city as saying here yesterday that I was aware of the fact
                that Professor Cox was receiving $1,000 annually from the miners and others in that
                interest in addition to what the State pays him. The House knows that what I said
                was in no offensive sense toward the Professor. I want to say this: I do not say
                that I did not say what is reported - for I have too much respect for the gentleman
                from whose pen these reports are derived - but I meant to say that I was informed
                that such was the fact by one of the proprietors in the mines. Although I do not
                think the statement derogatory to the Professor, I wish to say for him that such is
                not the fact. Still I was informed by one of those proprietors that, such was the
                fact.</p>

              section 12 of the act for the establishment of libraries, approved February 16, 1852,
              recommending its passags. It was ordered to the engrossment.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hedrick, from the <orgName>Committee on Rights and Privileges</orgName>, returned
              Mr. Furnas' bill [H. R. 43] prohibiting plank, MacAdam and gravel road companies from

              of the act into which Mr. Furnas' hunting and shooting bill was enacted; and secondly,
              their desire of the passage of a law to prohibit all foreign and domestic animals from
              roaming at large, and making their owners responsible for the damage they do.</p>

              recommended for passage has broader features and covers almost the whole ground of
              this bill, they preferred that this bill be laid on the table, so that if the other

            <p>Mr. Cauthorn said the law which this bill proposes to amend was passed several years
              ago, and has been declared to be unconstitutional in one of its clauses. And this bill
              simply proposes to amend that clause of section 22 which regulates the licensing of
              saloons in cities and towns which the Supreme Court has declared to be
              unconstitutional.</p>

            <p>The bill [H. R. 200] to authorize County Commissioners to equalize local county
              bounty to soldiers, was read the second time.</p>

              act shall not apply to any county that has already paid its bounty to soldiers filling
              the quota of such counties in full, according to the terms prescribed by the Board of

            <p>The bill [H. R. 2181 to amend section 208 of the Civil Practice act of June 18,

            <p>The bill [H. R. 169] to preserve the original mss., journals of the two Houses of the
              General Assembly, was read the second time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dwiggins, at the request of the Secretary of State, suggested that this bill be
              amended so as to require the clerks to record the minutes insix or five quire book,
              and he moved to refer the bill to the <orgName>Committee on Printing</orgName> with
              instructions to inquire into the propriety of so amending the bill.</p>
            <p>On motion agreed to.</p>

            <p>Mr. Orr presented a petition from some sixty inhabitants of Delaware county, praying
              for remedy for dams erected across streams of water - which have become dam nuisances
              because too high to allow water to run over them. It was referred to the appropriate
              committee.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wadge presented a memorial from Owen Eddy, late Deputy Secretary of State, for
              the indexing of the records of patents for swamp lands. Referred to the
                <orgName>Indexing Committee</orgName>.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thompson presented a petition from 400 ladies for the completion of the Women's

            <p>Mr. Taylor, from the <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName>, to which was referred
              the portion of Governor Baker's message with reference to memoralizing Congress to
              extend the time for the completion of agricultural colleges, reported that a bill in
              Congress obviates the necessity for such a step on the part of this Legislature.</p>
            <p>Mr. Fuller, from the <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName>, returned Mr.
              Armstrong's bill [S. 190] to legalize irregular proceedings of Boards of Equalization
              iu cities, with a favorable report thereon.</p>
            <p>Mr. Armstrong explained that this bill applied probably only to the city of
              Kokomo</p>
            <pb n="120" xml:id="VAA8558-14-120"/>
            <p>Report concurred in.</p>
            <p>Mr. Scott, Chairman of the <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName>, returned the
              bill [H. R. 155] providing for a Board of School Commissioners in cities of 8,000
              inhabitants and over, with a favorable report.</p>
            <p>Mr. Fuller presented a minority report recommending that this bill be laid on the
              table, believing that politics and sectarianism should find no avenues to creep into
              our public schools</p>
            <p>.Mr. Gooding was inclined to favor the minority report, believing that school
              commissioners would be better selected by the Council of cities than by ward meetings,
              where sectarian influences were more likely to obtain.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sarnighausen endorsed these remarks, and favored concurrence in the minority
              report.</p>
            <p>Mr. Scott objected to the argument for taking away elections from the people. Such a
              course is going beyond what experience in this country has taught us. If a matter can
              not be left to the people, he desired to know why. He moved that this subject be made
              a special order for Thursday, at half-past ten o'clock A. M.</p>
            <p>Mr. Orr thought the nearer we kept to the people, the safer we are.</p>
            <p>Motion for special order was agreed to.</p>

            <head rend="center">PURDUE UNIVERSITY.</head>
            <p>Mr. Taylor, from the <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName>, referred the bill [S.
              170] making an appropriation of $100,000 to Purdue University, with an amendment
              reducing the amount to $60,000, owing to the depleted state of the treasury of the
              State of Indiana.</p>
            <p>Mr. Fuller, from the minority of said committee, reported in favor of laying the bill
              on the table.He moved that this subject be made the special order for two o'clock
              Thursday afternoon.</p>
            <p>Rejected upon a division - affirmative 14, negative 14.</p>
            <p>Mr. Glessner moved to lay the minority report on the table.</p>
            <p>Motion agreed to.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bunyan moved to amend the report by striking out $60,000 and insert $50,000 in
              lieu.</p>
            <p>Mr. Glessner understood there is no use of making any appropriation under $60,000.Mr.
              Taylor recurred to the provisions of the act of Congress making donations in aid of
              the establishment of Agricultural Colleges, and stated that the offers of Mr. Purdue
              and of the citizens of Tippecanoe county to secure the location of the Indiana
              Agricultural College in his county, have been complied with to the letter; and that it
              will take at least $60,000 to put that institution in the condition required by the
              act of Congress - the time mentioned in said act expiring in July of next year. This
              is the first aid asked of the State of Indiana, and will probably be the last.</p>
            <p>Mr. Scott commended the action of the Trustees in making a purchase of land adjoining
              the grounds donated by Mr. Purdue thus early in the history of the University. He
              submitted it as a question for the consideration of the Senate now whether this
              institution should be helped to money needed or whether it shall fail for want of
              necessary means.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dwiggins regarded this as a question simply whether this State will have an
              Agricultural College or not. He said the State is realizing now about $32,800 as
              interest on the money obtained through the general government; and asked if it was
              shrewd financiering to refuse to take $32,800 annual interest when we can get it for
              an appropriation of $60,000.</p>
            <p>Mr. Steele stood ready to vote this $60,000 and even $100,000, for he regarded a
              college of this kind a necessity. The general government has furnished an endowment
              fund of over $300,000, and some $200,000 more has been furnished by individuals and by
              the county of Tippecanoe; now do we want an Agricultural College in Indiana? If so, is
              it probable that we shall ever get one on better terms than is offered at present?</p>
            <p>Mr. Dittemore objected to such a large appropriation, but gave way to a motion for a
              recess till two o'clock.</p>

            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
            <p> On motion of Mr. Wadge the order of business was suspended to enable him to offer a
              joint resolution [S. 10] directing the Attorney General to repair immediately to
              Chicago and file an injunction in the United States Court against the rebuilding of
              the Calumet dam, at Blue Island.</p>
            <p>Mr. Glessner moved to amend by striking out the instructions, and charging the party
              going to Chicago to take such steps as are necessary to prevent the reconstruction of
              the dam.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wadge accepted the amendment. The resolution, as amended, was adopted.</p>
            <div type="section">
              <head rend="center">PURDUE UNIVERSITY.</head>
              <p>The Senate then returned to the consideration of the matter pending at the time of
                the recess for dinnerbeing the reports from the Committee on Education on Mr.
                Taylor's bill [S. 170] making an appropriation to the Purdue University.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dittemore resumed his remarks in opposition to the appropriation proposed in
                the bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. Boone, Mr. Carnahan, Mr. Brown, Mr. Taylor and Mr. Steele spoke in favor of the
                proposed appropriation, and Mr. Fuller against it.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gooding demanded the previous question.</p>
              <p>The demand was seconded by the Senate.</p>
              <p>The amendment [Mr. Bunyan's] was rejected by yeas, 15; nays, 27.</p>
              <p>The majority report in favor of appropriating $60,000 was then concurred in by

              <p>On motion, the bill was read the second time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Slater moved to amend by inserting a section appropriating $10,000 to the
                trustees of Franklin College as an endowment fund.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown moved to lay the amendment on the table. Agreed to.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dittemore moved to amend by strking out "60,000" and inserting "55,000" in

              <p>On motion bv Mr. Taylor it was laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Taylor demanded the previous question, the Senate seconded the demand, and,

              <head rend="center">TAXATION OF BANKS.</head>
              <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, moved for a suspension of the rules, that Mr. Gregg's
                bill [S. 4], providing for the taxation of National banks for municipal purposes,
                might be considered. Motion agreed to.</p>
              <p>The bill [S. 4] was then read the third time, and passed the Senate by yeas 36,
                nays 3.</p>
              <p>The bill as it passed the Senate provides for the assessment and collection of

                under the laws of the United States, including the Bank of the State of Indiana and
                its several branches and national banks or banking associations. The bill provides
                that the County Auditor shall, on or before the first day of April in each year
                furnish to the Mayor or other proper officer of each town or city in the county in

                the Auditor shall furnish any information he may have in regard to the stockholders
                of such bank and the number of shares held by each, and the stockholders shall be
                taxed upon the shares of bank stock held by each for municipal purposes according to

              <p>The yeas and nays were ordered, and were being taken. Mr. Brown, when his name was
                called, desired to explain his vote. Objection being made, he moved for the

                the objection was withdrawn.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown then called for the reading of the joint resolution.</p>

              sense of the General Assembly as to the propriety of building a new State House at
              this time: and, therefore, directing the joint special committee on the new State
              House to prepare and report a bill at an early day providing for the erection of a new
              State House, and that the Senate be requested to concur herein.</p>
            <p>The Speaker. The gentleman should make it a concurrent resolution. The difference
              between a concurrent, and a joint resolution is that the latter must be published with
              the laws.</p>
            <p>Mr. Peed concurred in the modification.</p>
            <p>Mr. Woollen was in favor ot increasing the tax levy, so as to create a State House
              fund before commencing the work of the building.</p>
            <p>Mr. Branham stated the single purpose of the Committee was to get the sense of the
              House on the propriety of building the State House; for if the State House is to be
              built there are certain preliminary steps to be taken, one of which would be to
              increase the general levy for the purpose. If it should be the pleasure of the General
              Assembly to commence the building at once, and you make the levy now, you will get the
              tax one year hence; and that will be early enough to commence the building. And he
              considered the fund ought not to be created till about the time the State shall have
              occasion to use it. The people themselves are the safest and best custodians of their
              own money. We must know something about the expense of the building before we can
              determine upon the amount of the levy.</p>
            <p>Mr. Woollen desired to amend the instructions, to the joint committee, so that the
              special tax for the purpose shall commence in 1873, and the work of the erection of
              the building shall not be commenced until the next year.</p>
            <p>Mr. Woollen's amendment was rejected.</p>
            <p>Mr. Furnas could not vote for a State House appropriation till the Benevolent
              Institutions of the State be provided for and another Asylum built.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Rumsey, the further consideration of the subject was postponed and
              made the special order for next Tuesday.</p>

                with a recommendation that it lie on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner, from the Committee on Education, returned the bill [H. R. 56]
                authorizing appropriations of money for the State University with a favorable
                report.</p>
              <p>These reports were concurred in.</p>
              <p>He also returned Mr. Slater's bill [S. 41] to amend section five of the liquor law
                with a recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Slater explained the bill simply provides that liquor license money shall go to
                the school fund of the township when assessed instead of the general fund. He
                thought it a just bill to all parties, and hoped the report of the Committee would
                not be concurred in.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner favored concurrence in the Committee's report.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregg believed this fund properly belongs to the town or county where the
                license is granted. It was to compensate the immediate neighborhood for the in jury
                such places do. He moved the Senate do not concur in his report.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott sustained the Committee's judgment on this bill. His remarks were

              <p>The Lieutenant Governor announced the special order - being the consideration of
                the Joint Select Committee's bill [S. 238] to divide the state into circuits tor
                judicial purposes, abolishing the Courts of Common Pleas, etc.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown made an ineffectual motion to postpone the order till to-morrow.</p>
              <p>The Senate, pursuant to previous order, resolved itself into a Committee of the
                Whole (Mr. Dwiggins in the chair) and the bill was then being read throughout
                pursuant to rule 45 of the Senate, when - </p>
              <p>Mr. Brown moved ineffectually that the reading of the bill be dispensed with.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner moved to recommit the bill to the committee from whence it came, with
                instructions to increase the terms of the several courts to forty-two weeks, and
                also such amendments as may be proposed in <orgName>Committee of the
                Whole</orgName>.</p>
              <p>The Chairman held the motion out of order as the Senate has no such committee.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott moved that the committee rise, report progress and recommend that the
                bill be referred to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner moved that the reference be changed to the joint select committee on
                this subject. The House of Representatives has referred a copy of this same bill to
                that committee.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown moved that the committee rise and recommend that the bill be referred to
                a-committee of one from each Congressional District.</p>
              <p>Mr. Rhodes moved as a substitute to refer to a special committee of thirteen, with
                instructions to report a bill redistricting the State for judicial purposes,
                equalizing the labor in circuits and counties, make such changes in the number as
                may be necessary to accord with that object, and in counties where there are no
                Criminal Courts, transferring all business to Common Pleas.</p>
              <p>Mr. Smith moved, but failed to get a second, that the Committee recommend that the
                bill be laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Daggy moved to strike out the word "common pleas" in the substitute
                instructions. He desired a test vote.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gooding and Mr. Brown spoke in favor of abolishing the Common Pieas Court and
                the main features of the bill, while Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Boone took a different
                view, being decidedly against the proposition to abolish the common pleas system
                until something better and more economical is proposed in its stead. The remarks
                will appear in the Brevier Reports.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Dittemore, the Committee reported progress, and asked leave to sit
                again at two o'clock.</p>
              <p>The report was concurred in, and then the Senate took a recess.</p>

            <p>The Senate resolved itself in to a committee of the whole, and resumed the
              consideration of the bill [S. 238] redistricting the State for judicial purposes - the
              question being on the resolution by Mr. Daggy to strike the words "common pleas" from
              the substitute.</p>
            <p>Mr. Glessner addressed the committee in favor of the bill, and Mr. Steele in
              opposition.</p>
            <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
            <p>On motion by Mr. Glessner the vote just taken was reconsidered, and - </p>
            <p>The amendment was again rejected upon a division.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown offered an amendment looking to stripping the Common Pleas Court, of all
              except probate business, by striking from the substitute the word "territorial."</p>
            <p>On motion by Mr. Glessner all instructions in the substitute were stricken out, and
              it was left simply so as to refer the bill to a committee of thirteen, 'one from each
              Congressional," being incorporated in this motion at Mr. Brown's suggestion.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Brown, the committee rose, and the Chairman reported the Committee
              of the Whole recommend that the bill be referred to a select committee of thirteen -
              one from each Congressional district.</p>
            <p>The report was concurred in by the Senate.</p>

              <head rend="center">ROADS AND HIGHWAYS.</head>
              <p>The Lieutenant Governor announced the consideration of the special order for this
                hour being the bill [H. R. 59] to amend an amendatory act of the supervisor's act;
                and Mr. Harney's bill [S. 180] to make the township trustee of each civil township
                superintendent of roads and highways.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, the rule 45 of the Senate was suspended,
                and thus the clause requiring that the bill "shall be first read throughout by the
                Secretary" was dispensed with, and the Secretary proceeded to read the bill by
                sections.</p>
              <p>Section 1 of the H. R. 259, for working the roads not less that two nor more than
                four days being read, Mr. Howard made an ineffectual motion to strike out the word
                "four" and insert "three" in lieu, in the first section, so that the roads shall be
                worked three days instead of four days.</p>
              <p>There being but one section in this bill, the Chairman directed the Secretary read
                section 1 of the bill S. 180.</p>
              <p>Mr. Harney invited special attention to his bil, and proceeded to explain its
                provisions.</p>
              <p>The first section having been read - </p>
              <p>Mr. Gregg moved, ineffectually, to strike out the first section, as a test of the
                strength of the bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. Cave opposed the whole bill.</p>
              <p>The second section, proposing a commutation poll tax of two dollars, and a poll tax
                of fifty cents on each one hundred dollars, being read - </p>
              <p>Mr. Cave moved to strike it out.</p>
              <p>Mr. Harney explained that the only difference between this section and the present
                law is that $2 is substituted for the two days work, and fifty cents in place of
                twenty-five for property tax.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough moved to amend the motion by striking out all referring to the capita tax
                of two dollars. He did not believe the day laborer should be taxed in this way, but
                that the property of the country should make the roads.</p>
              <p>Mr. Orr and Mr. Bunyan opposed the amendment to the amendment.</p>
              <p>It was rejected.</p>
              <p>The motion to strike out the section was also rejected.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Harney, the property tax was reduced from fifty to to twenty-five
                cents - no voice in the negative.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott made an ineffectual motion to strike out $2 and insert $3 as the per
                capita tax.</p>
              <p>Sec. 3, requiring the the trustee, where there is any, in corporated towns in his
                township, to pay over one-half of the money collected for road purposes in the
                corporation to the town treasurers for use on the streets of said town, and
                exempting towns or cities situated in whole or in part in such township.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dougherty moved ineffectually, to strike out the word "one-half," and insert in
                lieu the word "all."</p>
              <p>Sec. 4, dividing the work on roads forming township lines being read - </p>
              <p>Mr. Collett proposed an amendment which was agreed to, requiring road running on a
                State line, to be kept in repair by the township, in connection with the road
                authorities of the State adjoining.</p>
              <p>Sec. 5 was amended by requiring the roads to be made hard "and even," and motion by
                Mr. Boone.</p>
              <p>Sec. 6 was amended, on motion of Mr. Scott, by <pb n="126" xml:id="VAA8558-14-126"
                /> requiring the civil engineer to fix the level and grade.</p>
              <p>Sec. 8, prescribing the time when road work shall be done, was read.</p>
              <p>Sec. 9, concerning: the appointment of road masters, was amended, on motion of Mr.
                Boone, by requiring the work to be approved by the township trustee.</p>
              <p>Sec. 9, prescribing the duties of the road master in hiring workmen, was amended by
                Mr. Hough by inserting "not exceeding" before the words "such as is usual in the
                township"referring to the price to be paid.</p>
              <p>Mr. Cave made an ineffectual motion to reduce the number of hours of labor from
                "ten" to "eight."</p>
              <p>Mr. Chapman moved to further amend by striking out the words "or such as may be a
                day's work in the township."</p>
              <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
              <p>Sec. 11, allowing the road master's agent two dollars for each day's work.</p>
              <p>Sec. 12, making the trustee custodian of the property belonging to the road
                district.</p>
              <p>Sec 13, directing the trustee to turn over the property and money on hand to his
                successor.</p>
              <p>Sec. 14, concerning the letting of the work, were passed over without
                amendment.</p>
              <p>Sec. 15, prescribing penalty for destruction or obstruction of any highway or
                bridge, was amended on motion of Mr. Boone so that one-half the usually, traveled
                roadway shall be given by each passing team.</p>
              <p>Sec. 16, having reference to the construction of roads and road viewers.</p>
              <p>Sec. 17, requiring the removal of obstructions on public highways.</p>
              <p>Sec. 18, declaring all trees to belong to the owner of the land if he avail himself
                of the same before the Trustee opens the road.</p>
              <p>Sec. 19, concerning guide boards, and, Sec. 20, auhorizing trustees to administer
                oaths necessary in conducting his business, were passed without amendment.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Collett, a section was added requiring semi-annual
                settlements.</p>
              <p>Mr. Fuller desired to know if any petitions have come up here praying for a
                reconstruction of the road laws, and declared that our present system should not be
                disturbed without good cause. He moved to strike out from the bill all except
                section four, referring to roads running on Stare and township lines.</p>
              <p>Mr. Harney declared it was of paramount importance that the road laws of the State
                should be revised and amended. He had met with many complaints against the present
                system.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dittemore moved ineffectually to strike from the bill all after the enacting
                clause.</p>
              <p>The motion to strike out all except the fourth section was also rejected.</p>
              <p>Mr. Case thought this bill may operate well enough where there are no gravel roads.
                It would work great hardship in his section. There are many men in every district
                hardly able to pay this tax of two dollars for each person as required by this bill,
                and he pointed out a number of objectionable features.</p>
              <p>Mr. Orr also opposed the bill because of the two dollars poll tax and the heavy
                property tax it proposed to impose.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregg claimed for this subject great consideration and respect. We should be
                very careful what kind of a law is substituted for the present statute. He did not
                believe the poll tax too high, for persons not able to pay the tax can work it out
                on the road. He believed such a tax should be exacted from every able bodied
                man.</p>
              <p>Mr. Francisco hoped this bill would not pass. The present law has stood for nearly
                forty years, and it suited his district very well. If the tax is required in money
                in many cases it will not be paid at all in his county, because of inability and
                impossibility to collect.</p>
              <p>Mr. Fuller called attention to the fact that they did not make good roads in the
                southern part of the State, and the people there are well satisfied with the gravel
                road system.</p>
              <p>Mr. Sleeth moved to amend by striking out of section three the word one-half, and,
                insert in lieu thereof the word "all". We ought to maintain the principle that each
                district shall expend in its own territory the tax the citizens thereof pay.</p>
              <p>Mr. Haworth moved in effectually to amend the amendment by inserting the words "or
                such further sum of money as the township - trustee may deem necessary to put the
                streets in repair."</p>
              <p>The amendment proposed by Mr. Sleeth was rejected.</p>
              <p>Mr. O'Brien moved to add in the same section the words "or towns" after the word
                "cities." There are no people taxed so much for keeping up roads as the people in
                towns and cities, and he hoped the Committee would vote down the proposition to tax
                the people to build roads out of their neighborhood.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele contended that one-half the road tax collected in cities and towns ought
                to be applied on the streets.</p>
              <p>The motion [Mr. O'Brien's] was rejected.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hall moved that the committee rise, report back H. R. 59 and the bill S. 180,
                and recommend that the former bill lie on the table, and the latter be passed with
                the amendments of the <orgName>Committee of the Whole.</orgName></p>
              <p>This motion was amended by a recommendation that both bills be laid on the
                table.</p>
              <p>The motion, as amended, was agreed to.</p>
              <p>Accordingly, the committee rose, and the chairman reported to the Senate, as
                instructed, viz: a recommendation that both bills lie on the table.</p>

              defendant resides in the adjoining county, and to provide for the service of execution
              thereon, was taken up on the third reading.</p>
            <p>Mr. Miller stated that, as the law stands, when a man has a claim against another
              residing in an adjoining county, if it is less than twenty-five dollars, he can't sue
              without additional costs. But as the law now allows the Justice of the Peace to issue
              subpoenas to the adjoining county, it has been thought best to allow summons also to
              run to the adjoining county; and this bill provides that the Justice may issue such
              summons and put it in the hands of the plaintiff, and he may cause it to be served in
              the adjoining county. The result is to extend somewhat the jurisdiction of Justices of
              the Peace. I do not think it can work any hardship.</p>

            <p>Mr. Miller's bill [H. R. 271], to amend section 25 of the practice act of June, 1852,
              was taken up on the third reading.</p>
            <p>Mr. M. said, this bill is intended to overrule a decision of the Supreme Court in
              XXXI. Indiana Reports. It provides that in such actions where the property is
              misdescribed, the court may cancel the mistakes, just as the court now does in
              misdescriptions in mortages. In XXXI. Ind. it is held that the court can't correct the
              description of the property. This simply affirms the substance of the decision in the
              XI. Ind. The bill was suggested and drawn by a friend of mine. It was finally passed
              the House of Representatives. Yeas, 78; nays, 1.</p>

            <p>The Speaker announced the special order, viz.: the consideration of Mr. Thayer's bill
              [H. R. 303], to amend sections 2 and 6 of the act providing for a geological survey,
              and for the collection and preservation of a geological and chemical cabinet of the
              natural history of the State, creating the office of State Geologist, defining his
              duties and fixing his salary, and making appropriations for the same, approved March
              6, 1869. The question being on the pending amendments, viz.: for striking out the
              $10,000 total appropriation, and inserting $6,000 in lieu, and striking out the $3,600
              salary of the Geologist, and inserting $2,500 in lieu.</p>
            <p>Mr. Butterworth considered the importance of the State Geologist and his work to the
              State at large. His remark the other day with reference to geologists was ungarded.
              Professor Cox has done a good work and done it well; and it is right that we all
              maintain for him a good fair salary. But this bill is for an annual appropriation and
              it makes the salary too large. If we allow the Geologist $2,500 that is a greater
              salary than is received by any Professor in the colleges of ths State. But as far as
              the continuation of these surveys are concerned, he failed to see the demand for
              additional expenses in this way. He would have the Geologist to proceed as in the
              past, without incurring additional expense as to the surveys, but with an increase of
              salary.</p>
            <p>Debate followed in which Messrs. Reno, Gregory, Mellett, Kimball, North, Johnson,
              Lenfesty and Branham participated, (see Appendix XIV brevier reports) and after sundry
              propositions to amend resulting in making the total appropriation $8,000 and the
              salary of the Geologist $3,000. The bill was finally passed the House of

            <head rend="center">LOCAL OPTION TEMPERANCE.</head>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Furnas, the order of business was suspended, and the House took up
              the consideration of the local option temperance bill [H. R. 327] to regulate the sale
              of intoxicating liquors, and to provide punishments for damages by drunkenness, etc.,
              which he now reported again from the <orgName>Committee on Temperance</orgName>, with
              sundry amendments which were concurred in.</p>
            <p>Mr. Furnas then moved that the bill be considered as engrossed and put now upon its
              passage, which was agreed to, and the bill as amended was read the third time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Schmuck. The only part in the temperance bill now before the House that
              recommends itself to my mind, and which meets my approval, is that portion of section
              nine making it unlawful and fineable for any person to get intoxicated. All the
              balance, from beginning to the end, ought to receive the condemnation of the
              representatives of a liberty and order loving people by a manly expression of "No"
              when the bill is put upon its passage. In effectshould the majority vote for its
              passageit is a prohibitory law, circumscribing individual liberty, denying rights and
              privileges to the citizen guaranteed him by the Constitution of the United States and
              of the State, and pernicious, as it opens wide the doors of court houses, inviting
              litigation by parties totally irresponsible, of a doubtful and bad character, and
              robbing men engaged in a business which has always been recognized as legitimate.</p>
            <p>No one denies to the government the right to define and punish any and every act that
              is in itself criminal; but when a government undertakes to declare any act criminal
              that is not palpably so, the government becomes an oppression and commits a crime
              itself. Whenever government attempts to interfere with the inalienable rights of the
              citizen, it becomes tyrannical.</p>
            <p>Murder, theft, arson, and every act that one citizen can commit, that interferes with
              the life, liberty, or property of another, are so easily recognized, that every one of
              them has been denounced and punished by laws, as universal as civilization.</p>
            <p>But when a sect or party, accidentally holding the legislative power, attempt to set
              up their sectarian or party notions of morality and declare criminal what has always
              been considered and recognized as legitimate, that party is commiting a crime itself.
              We have a right to regulate the sale of gunpowder, combustible oil, spirituous liquors
              and food of every description, and to punish their adulteration; but when such
              legislation goes to the extent of interfering with the legitimate commerce and
              industry of the country - even though it be placed on moral ground - I conceive it is
              going beyond its power. Forced morality, has never produced good as has been proven by
              every attempt to make the Maine Liquor Law effective. Morality can only be enforced by
              education and public sentiment. The means used to evade all laws that are inconsistent
              with public sentiment are productive of more immorality than the act prohibited.</p>
            <p>A law must command the respect of the people, and unless it is in accord with the
              sentiment of the people, it is a farce - a dead letter, and would have been better to
              have kept it out of the statute book. Are you ready, gentlemen, to say that the people
              are prepared for a law as proposed in the pending "bill?" I can assure you of this,
              that the people of my county, if it were left to them to adopt or reject this "bill,"
              would almost unanimously vote to put this bill in the waste basket as so much waste

              "high-toned,"refined and "moral community in the Stale. The many fearful evils
              attributed as resulting from the sale and use of intoxicating liquors - is an
              assertion without foundation. Where was the intoxicating liquor that caused the first
              "murder" recorded in holy writ? Was not Cain, the perpetrator of that crime, a born
              murderer? We may continue to build reformatory institutions all over this State,
              houses of correction for bad and vicious boys - there will be a continual demand for
              them, unless we, as a people, change our notion in regard to making fortunes easy. How
              many boys and girls are there who are not made bad and vicious by indulgent, doting
              parents - who desire their sons to be gentlemen and their daughters ladies whose hands
              are not to be soiled by honest labor? Teaching them idleness-the "root of all evil."
              We, as legislators, are encouraging dishonesty by exempting large amounts of money or
              property from execution, and defrauding honest creditors. By our system of granting
              divorces, we have loosened the morals of the people, and in place of looking at
              marriage as a most sacred bond, it is so much stock in trade by a large number of our
              people, and the fearful evils (in the memorial of the Friends, now upon our desks),
              said to be the result of the sale and use of intoxicating liquors as a beverage, might
              be laid at the door of idleness, laws exempting so much property from execution, the
              granting of divorces made easy, etc. But, gentlemen, I do not want to appear before
              you as a moralist. I desire a conservative spirit to breathe in all our laws, and not
              fanaticism. A prohibitory law will not affect me personally, but I am opposed to the
              principle of prohibition! It is wrong - it is oppressive - it is tyrranical. Our
              present law governing the sale of intoxicating liquors is good enough, let it be
              enforced. I am opposed to this bill, and hope it will not pass.</p>

              support, by reason of any sale or sales of intoxicating liquors to any person, by the
              person receiving such permit, or by any of his agents or employes. Separate suits may
              be brought on said Bond by the person or persons injured, but the aggregate amount
              recovered thereon shall not exceed the said sum of $3,000, and in case the amount of

              ward, district or township, a majority of whose names shall be signed to the petition
              of such applicant. And it is further provided that any person not a legal voter in

            <p>Sec. 5. No permit as herein provided for shall be granted for a longer or shorter
              time than one year. It shall be the duty of the Auditor of the county to furnish the

              up in a conspicuous place in the room where such liquor is sold, where the same may at
              all times be seen and read by any person desiring to do so. Should any person holding
              a permit be convicted of a violation of any of the provisions of this act, such
              conviction shall work forfeiture of his permit.</p>

              shall be punished as hereinafter provided.</p>

              without permit, cause the intoxication, in whole or in part, of any other person,

              the fine above mentioned arid as a part of his or her punishment for the offense, be
              imprisoned in the county jail not less than one day nor more than ten days, at the
              discretion of the court.</p>

              shall first be levied on the property of the person selling, bartering, or giving away
              such liquor. And in the event of a failure, or insufficiency of such property to
              satisfy the judgment thereof, then of the property of the other defendants. A married
              woman shall have the same right to bring suit and to control the same, and the amount
              recovered, as a femme sole. And all damages recovered by a minor under this act shall
              be paid, either to such minor or to his or her parent, guardian, or next friend, as
              the court shall direct. The unlawful sale or giving away of intoxicating liquor shall
              work a forfeiture of all rights of the lessee or tenant, under any lease or contract
              of rent, upon the premises where such unlawful sale, bartering or giving away shall
              take place. All suits for damages under this act may be by any appropriate action in
              any of the courts of this State having competent jurisdiction. All judgments recovered
              under the provisions of this act may be enforced without any relief, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Sec. 13. In all cases where husband, wife, parent or child, or guardian, shall have a
              right of action, as provided in section 12 of this act, and shall fail or refuse to
              prosecute the same, and in all cases where such intoxicated person has neither
              husband, wife, parent, child or guardian, the township trustee, or other officer
              having charge of the poor of the township where such intoxicated person resides, shall

              of such officer to prosecute ail such actions in the name of such township. All money
              collected upon such judgments, after deducting therefrom all costs and charges against
              such township, occasioned thereby, shall be paid by the township trustee or <pb

              substituted for the name of the township; but such persons so substituted shall have
              no power to dismiss such action or compromise the same in any manner except by
              permission of the court.</p>
            <p>Section 14. For every violation of the provisions of the first and sixth sections of
              this act, the person so offending shall forfeit and pay a fine of not less than ten
              dollars nor more than fifty dollars, or be imprisoned in the jail of the county not
              less than ten nor more than thirty days. For every violation of the provisions of the
              seventh section of this act, any person convicted as the keeper of any of the places
              therein declared to be nuisances, shall forfeit and pay a fine of not less than twenty
              nor more than fifty dollars, and such place or places so kept by such person
              convicted, shall be shut up and abated as a common nuisance by the order of the court
              before which such conviction may be had, as a further punishment, and such order shall
              be a part of the judgment of conviction.</p>
            <p>Section 16. The penalty and provisions mentioned in the thirteenth section of this
              act, may be enforced by indictment in any court of record having criminal
              jurisdiction, and all pecuniary fines or penalties provided for in any of the sections

              committed to the jail of the county until the judgment and costs are fully paid, and
              the magistrate or court in which the conviction is had shall issue a writ of capias ad

              arising under the eighth and twelfth sections of this act, when the amount in
              controversy does not exceed two hundred dollars, such actions to be prosecuted in the
              name of the party injured or entitled to the debt or damages provided for in said
              eighth and twelfth sections.</p>
            <p>Sec. 17. It shall be unlawful for any person to buy for or furnish to any person who
              is at the time intoxicated, or in the habit of getting intoxicated, or to buy for or
              furnish to any minor, to be drunk by such, minor, any intoxicating liquor. Any person
              or persons violating this section shall be fined not less than five dollars nor more
              than fifty dollars.</p>
            <p>Sec. 18. In all prosecutions under this act, by indictment or otherwise, it shall not
              be necessary to state the kind of liquor sold, or to describe the place where sold,
              and it shall not be necessary to state the name of the person to whom sold. In all
              cases, the person or persons to whom intoxicating liquors shall be sold in violation
              of this act, shall be competent witnesses to prove such facts, or any other tending
              thereto.</p>
            <p>Sec. 19. The following form of complaint shall be sufficient in criminal proceeding
              before justices of the peace or mayors, under this act, when applicable, but may be
              varied to suit the nature of the case, namely: State of Indiana, ____ county, ss.

              provisions of this act, be and the same are hereby repealed, but nothing in this act
              shall be so construed as to prohibit the common councils of cities and the boards of

            <p>Mr. Heller's bill [H. R. 236] to provide for taking the sense of the qualified voters

              it would in no way interfere with proposition to amend the Constitution. Whilst he was

                authorize county recorders to make and maintain indexes of deeds and mortgages,
                etc., was taken up in order on the third reading. Mr. Thayer said this bill was
                introduced at the suggestion of his county recorder. It simply requires the recorder
                to fill blanks which are prepared in all county auditor's books, under the headings
                "kind of deed" and ''amount of consideration,'' and allowing him the usual
                compensation for such work.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brett suggested that it is not good policy to introduce bills here at the

              <p>Mr. Lenfesty. The law contemplates it as the duty of the Recorder to make and keep
                these indexes. It is so done by the Recorder of Grant county without any additional
                cost.</p>
              <p>Mr. Schmuck said the County Commissioners may require these indexes. Several years
                ago, when he was Recorder for Perry county, there was no such index of deeds and
                mortgages in his office; and, on the petition of those interested, the Commissioners
                made an order for the index, which he himself made out and got his pay for it.</p>

                his office, and refuse to account for or pay over such money or property, shall be
                deemed guilty of embezzlement, fined not exceeding double the value of the amount
                embezzled, and imprisoned not exceeding two years. Mr. M. said it was to supply an
                emission in the statutes defining the crime of embezzlement. The only law on the
                subject was passed March 5, 1855, intending to compel persons having money in their
                possession belonging to another to pay it over, and the law of December 21,1865,
                defining the crime of embezzlement on the part of bankers. The courts decide that
                the act of 1865 does not apply to county and municipal officers of the State. This

                have been kept, but they have been taken home by the clerks. This record ought to be
                kept to enable the successive committees to keep out the practice which has grown up
                of repeating claims until they are finally allowed - some claims which, perhaps, if
                all the facts were known, would not be allowed. The injustice ought to be regulated
                by legislative action, and in this bill it is proposed to make a start by requiring
                the Committee on Claims to keep a record of what they do - what claims are
                recommended and paid, and what rejected; so that those who may come after us, if

                affirmation, and a cause of removal and a manner of removal from office of any

            <p>The reading of the journal of yesterday was dispensed with.</p>
            <p>Mr. Taylor submitted a report from the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName>,
              returning Mr. Harney's joint resolution [S. 8] with reference to the cancellation of
              certain State bonds and coupons, to be redeemed under the act passed December 12,
              1872, with a recommendation that it do pass.</p>
            <p>The report was concurred in, and the joint resolution passed the Senate by yeas 31,
              nays 5.</p>
            <p>On motion by Mr. Dittemore, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of Senate bills
              on the third reading.</p>
            <p>The <orgName>Committee on State Printing</orgName> and the <orgName>Committee on
                Education</orgName>, were granted leave of of absence for the balance of the week,
              after today.</p>
            <p>Mr. Steele made an ineffectual motion to reconsider the votes granting leave of
              absence to these committees.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dwiggins' bill [S. 100] to amend sections 352 and 354 of the general civil
              practise act of June, 1852 - concerning the granting of new trials - was read the
              third time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Daggy explained that the biil amends by adding exceptions for causes embodied in
              the first, second and eighth clauses, of the old section 352. It also amends section
              351, by adding a clause, "unless unavoidably prevented," etc. and if application be
              made and not disposed of, etc.</p>
            <p>The bill finally passed the Senate by yeas 30, nays 2.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sarnighausen's bill [S. 69] to authorize and empower incorporated cities to hold,
              sell and convey real estate was read the third time, and finally passed the Senate by
              yeas 40, nays 1.</p>
            <p>Mr. Scott called up the special order for the hour, being the bill [H. R. 155]
              providing for a general system of common schools for cities of 8,000 inhabitants and
              over, and the election of school trustees, etc.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sarnighausen said this bill proposes to make a radical change, and as the present
              law gives general satisfaction, he was opposed to the change.</p>
            <p>A few men in the county of Wayne having some difficulty with school trustees, have
              proposed this bill, which does not give satisfaction even to their neighbors. And
              citizens of that county have presented a remonstrance against this bill, with more
              signatures than is on the petition for its passage. The disaffected persons referred
              to may have reasons sufficient for the removal of their school trustees, but
              insufficient for changing the present law. And it would be unwise in his opinion to do
              so. It has been said here that we should trust the people, and if they are trusted
              with the election of high officers in the government they certainly can be trusted
              with the election of school trustees. But there is a great difference between a
              political office and the office of school trustee. Many men eminently fitted for the
              office of school trustee are unfit to hold a political office, and vice versa, and it
              is frequently the case that the former will not allow themselves to mix up with
              political caucuses and the machinery necessary to secure a political nomination, and
              so if the school trustee be elected at the ballot box, the people lose the services of
              these men pre-eminently qualified.</p>
            <p>On motion by Mr. Chapman, the vote of day before yesterday, concurring in the
              majority report recommending the passage of the bill, was reconsidered.</p>
            <p>He then moved to substitute for the majority report the minority report, which
              recommends that the bill lie on the table.</p>
            <p>This motion was agreed to by yeas, 28; nays, 13.</p>
            <p>The majority report as amended was concurred in.</p>
            <p>Mr. Beardsley's bill [S. 73] to amend sections 15 and 16 of the town incorporation
              act of June 11, 1852, and providing for the election of the town marshal hy the town
              trustees, was read the third time and finally passed the Senate by yeas, 37; nays,
              3.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown, by leave, submitted a report from the <orgName>Committee on
                Railroads</orgName> in reference to the Terre Haute and Indianapolis railroad
              company, in compliance with a Senate resolution adopted on the 14th of December
              last.</p>
            <p>The Committee make no recommendation, pre- <pb n="133" xml:id="VAA8558-14-133"/>
              ferring to leave all the questions embodied in this subject matter to be decided by
              the Judiciary for the reason that an expression of any opinion thereon might in some
              measure be prejudicial to one or the other party in any such suit.</p>
            <p>The report is signed by Messrs. Brown, Dittemore, Sleeth and Bird.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown made a speech explanatory of the reasons which influenced the committee to
              make this report, and urging concurrence therein by the Senate. Mr. Harney and Mr.
              Gooding and Mr. Scott also spoke in favor of the report.</p>
            <p>Messrs. O'Brien and Steele submitted reasons why the report should be amended by
              striking therefrom the expression that committee found no evidence of fraud.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hough made an ineffectual motion - ayes, 13: nays, 29to lay the report on the
              table.</p>
            <p>Mr. Steele moved to strike out that part of the report expressing the opinion that
              there has been no fraud, etc. It is in these words:</p>
            <p>"And your committee further report that in the investigations made they find no
              evidence of corruption, concealment, or fraud in the matter of said company's
              relations and obligations to the State."</p>
            <p>The motion was agreed to by - yeas, 19; nays, 24 - as follows:</p>

            <p>So that portion of the report was stricken out, Messrs Daggy, Dwiggins, Gooding,
              Hough, Harney, Scott, Steele, Thompson and Wadge, explaining their votes.</p>
            <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
            <p>Mr. Daggy, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said he was
              interested in this matter to this extent, that he has been attorney for the road. He
              contended that, while the Senate ought to do justice to the people, it ought also to
              do justice to the railroads. Why strike from this report one fact on one side and
              leave a fact standing on the other? As the matter stood, he voted ''no."</p>
            <p>Mr. Dwiggins, when his name was called, said, in explanation of his vote, that it was
              a fact the evidence taken by the committee does not disclose any fraud on the part of
              the road, and therefore he voted "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. Gooding, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said the report of
              the committee does not pretend that it took all the evidence that could be heard, but,
              on the contrary, it expressly states that the committee did not have all the evidence
              they could get, and with the evidence before it, the committee discovered no fraud.
              They don't say that there is none. He voted "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. Harney, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said in his opinion
              it was not competent for the Senate to strike out any part of the report. This House
              instructed the committee to report the facts. They report a fact and it is improper to
              strike it out. He voted "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. Scott, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said he thought it
              would be cruel to strike out the matter proposed. That seemed to him to be the most
              important part of the report. This is a matter the committee were sent out to
              investigate, and now they report their opinion. The Senate is not called upon to
              decide on the evidence - the motion is simply to strike out the committee's
              conclusions based upon the evidence. It looked to him as though it would be wrong and
              would not be treating the company fair to adopt this motion. The opinion one way or
              the other will not increase the revenues of the school fund, and there is no way any
              Senator can so construe the law. The trouble about the whole matter is this: the
              moment you strike this clause out of the report you create an inference against this
              corporation - the very thing the committee desire to avoid, as this report is made, or
              intended to be made, so as not to influence legislation one way or the other. You had
              better leave it alone if you want it should be fair. By adopting this motion the
              Senate will be interfering and deciding in favor of one party and against the other in
              this case. He insisted such a course would be wrong, and it would be cruel. He voted
              "No."</p>
            <p>Mr. Steele said, when his name was called in explanation of his vote, that he didn't
              look upon this matter as the Senator from Vigo (Mr. Scott.) He did not think this
              committee went out for the purpose of vindicating the character of any gentleman or of
              any corporation; neither did he think the committee had the power to determine
              character one way or the other. He also disagreed with that Senator in another
              particular: that the committee were sent out to determine whether there was fraud in
              this matter or not. The main question for them to determine, was whether there should
              be suit brought directly against the company to recover any moneys that might be due
              the common school fund, and that perhaps was the only question. He did not want to be
              cruel, but voted "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. Thompson, in explanation of his vote, said, when his name was called, that this
              committee was sent out for a certain purpose. They went to a great deal of pains and
              now make a plain statement, and say they find no evidence of fraud. If we strike that
              out we literally say we do. He voted "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. Wadge, when his name was called, said in explanation of his vote, that to
              suppress the portion of the report proposed to be stricken out, would have the same
              effect as a virtual reflection upon the railroad company - as an inference that there
              had been fraud committed. It seemed to him that the committee were bound to
              investigate that matter, and presuming they have done so to the best of their
              judgment, he should vote "no."</p>
            <p>The report, so amended, was then concurred in by yeas 30, nays 13.</p>
            <p>The Senate then took a recess.</p>

            <p> Mr. Dwiggins, by consent, offered a resolution which was adopted, directing the

            <p>Mr. Neff offered a resolution limiting Senators to ten minute speeches.</p>

              <p>Mr. Gooding, from the <orgName>Committee on Railroads</orgName>, returned the bill
                [H. R. 164] to provide for the keeping in repair of the crossings of railroads with
                a favorable report.</p>
              <p>He also returned from the <orgName>Committee on Rights and Privileges</orgName> the
                bill to protect citizens from empiricism with a recommendation that it be
                indefinitely postponed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner, from the same Committee returned Mr. Armstrong's bill [S. 120] to
                protect the ballot box, with amendmends striking out in several places, and adding a
                section imposing a fine in any sum not exceeding $1,000 and imprisonment not more
                than five years, and disfranchised for any determinite period.</p>
              <p>These reports were severally concurred in.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Dittemore, the bill [H. R. 372] supplemental to the specific
                appropriation bill of last session, making provision for the pay of <pb n="134"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-14-134"/> employes of the General Assembly and clerks of the
                Secretary, Treasurer and Auditor of State, was read the first time. He then moved
                for a dispensation of the constitutional restriction, that the bill may be pressed
                to its final passage. </p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins objected to the bill, because it granted large authority to the State
                officers to the clerks, draw pay for them, etc. Referred to the <orgName>Committee
                  on Finances</orgName>.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough's bill [S. 77] to amend section 476 of the civil practice act of June 18,
                1852with reference to the sale of property on executionwas read the third time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough explained that the bill provides where property is sold by the Sheriff
                and the purchaser fails to pay his bid, and suit is brought to recover, the judgment
                shall also waive valuation and appraisement laws, if the execution did. Passed the

              <p>Mr. Rhodes' bill [S. 74] to legalize the acts and proceedings of boards of county
                commissioners in certain cases, was read the third time and passed by yeas 33, nays
                7 - Mr. Rhodes explaining its special application to his county.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown's bill [S. 106] to prescribe the qualification of petit jurors in this
                State either a householder or freeholder, and a qualified voter, and who has not
                served as a juror in such county for one year immediately preceding such selection,
                was read the third time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Boone thought this bill would cause great delay in filling up a jury.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner regarded the point a good one against professional jurors.</p>
              <p>Mr. Slater demanding the previous question, it was seconded by the Senate, and

                the safisfaction of mortgages given to secure payment of moneys borrowed from the
                school fund, was read the third time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Smith explained the necessity for the bill: Farmers are sometimes careless
                about clearing the record when they pay their mortgage notes, and this bill will
                enable that to be done with less trouble than under the present statute.</p>
              <p>The bill passed by yeas 43, nays none.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown called up the motion to reconsider the vote of several evenings since by
                which the Senate refused to pass the resolution [H. R. -] complimenting the
                President of the United States on his policy toward the Indian tribes, the pending
                question being a motion to lay that motion on the table.</p>
              <p>Several points of order were raised by members on Democratic benches, which were
                promptly overruled by the President pro tem.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown demanded the previous question. The demand was seconded by the Senate -
                yeas 24, nays 20.</p>
              <p>The motion to lay on the table the motion to reconsider was rejected, by yeas 20,

              <p>The motion to reconsider the vote rejecting the resolution was agreed to.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown moved the adoption of the resolution.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins demanded the previous question, and it, being seconded by yeas 24,
                nays 19 - </p>
              <p>The concurrent resolution being read, it was adopted by yeas 25, nays 19.</p>
              <p>Mr. Daggy moved to reconsider the vote just taken.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Brown, this motion was laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner's bill [S. 27] to legalize certain acts of certain corporations
                organized or attempted to be organized under the plank, macadam and gravel road law
                of 1852, and acts amendatory thereof, was read the third time. </p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner explained that this bill applied only to roads built by voluntary
                subscription, and probably would apply to no other than roads in his county.
                Rejected - yeas 15, nays 22.</p>
              <p>Mr. Collett's bill [S. 99] to authorize sureties paying for their principals, to
                collect from their principals the same rate of interest on the amount paid as was
                specified in the original paper.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough obtained unanimous consent to amend the bill so that the rate of interest
                shall not exceed ten per cent.</p>
              <p>The bill as amended was passed the Senate by yeas, 35; nays, 4.</p>
              <p>Mr. Howard's, bill [S. 140] to amend sections, and repeal section 4 of the act
                prescribing who may make a will, the effect thereof, etc., approved May 31, 1852,
                was read the third time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Howard explained the aim of the bill to be to make provisions for children born
                after the making of a will, so that posthumous children shall receive the same share

              <p>Mr. Gregg hoped the bill would pass, for he did not believe there was a more

            <p>Mr. Peed's bill [H. R. 160] to amend the act declaring the carnal knowledge of an
              insane woman a felony, and making accessories therein principals, was taken up on the
              third reading.</p>
            <p>Mr. Givan. The bill is not in proper shape. I do not understand it as an amendment;
              it is simply a supplemental section.</p>
            <p>Mr. Peed was of opinion that the statute can be amended in this way; but if the House
              should not think so, perhaps the bill should be recommitted. The bill is simply to
              make parties who abet in this crime punishable as principals. The judgment of the
              courts in our part of the State is that this can not be done under the law of 1859,
              which it is proposed by this bill to amend.</p>
            <p>Mr. Miller. This bill was reported back from the <orgName>Committee on the
                Judiciary</orgName>, with a recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed, in
              which the House did not concur. In the first place I think such a bill unnecessary; it
              is defining a crime that is already defined in 2, Gavin &amp; Hord, 405: ''Any person
              who aids or abets in any crime shall be charged, tried and convicted in the same
              manner as the principal." And another reason why I am opposed to this bill is this: It
              is hardly possible that any person would aid in such a crime - it is extremely
              improbable: and for the credit of the State, it seems to me that we should not enact
              laws needlessly, the reading of which will call up revolting ideas.</p>

              was taken up on the final reading.</p>
            <p>Mr. Walker. The law as it now stands for the appraisement of property to be sold
              under execution, authorizes the execution, defendant and plaintiff to select two
              appraisers, and if they can't agree, the sheriff te select the third. It is known that
              these selections are frequently so managed that the appraisements fail. This bill
              purposes that where the parties do not agree, the sheriff shall select the appraisers
              so disinterested that neither the plaintiff nor defendant shall have the advantage. It
              was finally passed the House of Representatives. Yeas, 81; nays, 1.</p>

            <p>Mr. Jones' bill [H. R. 316], to authorize township trustees to levy a tax, annually,
              in addition to that now authorized by law, not exceeding twenty-five cents on the

              and repairs of school houses, and for school apparatus, and declaring an emergency,
              was taken up on the third reading. Mr. J. said: The bill is specially desired in my
              county of Madison. It will be probably entirely local in its effect - the township to
              which it is intended to apply being indebted - for these purposes to the extent of
              $12,000.</p>
            <p>Mr. Woollen. This is simply for the purpose of enabling the people to tax themselves
              to pay their debts.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shirley objected to the bill, because the law now allows the trustees to levy a
              school tax to the extent of twenty-five cents on the $100, and this allows twenty-five
              cents more, which is too heavy.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mellett. The bill provides that the trustees may add this where the ownships are
              now indebted for school house purposes. It failed on this vote in the House of

            <p>Mr. W. said this bill was gotten up on the suggestion of the former Secretary of
              State and the Governor. To any gentleman who will inspect the office of Secretary of
              State it will be found to be very much exposed to fire. The old furnace has been
              thrown away, the shelvings are too high, there is no orderly filing of all the
              property records there, in which the city of Indianapolis is interested as well as the
              State at large; the whole suggesting forcibly, the neccessity for this bill. It is to
              so reconstruct that office that all parties interested may find there what they have a
              right to examine.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brett. I am decidedly opposed to the bill in its present shape. This thing of
              organizing the Secretary's office into several bureaus, with an array of clerks, ought
              not to be done. For two years while I was Treasurer of State I occupied an office
              adjoining that of the Secretary of State. He had then one clerk, and they were idle
              half the time; though I presume they did their duty. Now it is proposed to establish
              four bureaus there, and require the Secretary of State to keep account of business and
              statistics, taking business out of the hands of the Auditor of State. I can't
              understand its object, unless it is to create positions for office seekers. The
              provision that the Governor and officers of State may step in and stop abuses, amounts
              to nothing; they won't take the responsibility of interfering in a matter that has
              been taken in hand by the Legislature. If the books and files are in an unsafe
              condition, or badly arranged, I have no objections to taking care of them; but if I
              have to take this bill for what good there may be in it, I shall have to vote against
              it. I am glad to observe the disposition of the House to avoid extravagance, and I
              hope it will not change that practice at this time. It seems to me that some better
              mode than this may be provided to correct the negligencies of public officers.</p>
            <p>Mr. Branham was not sufficiently posted in regard to the provisions of this bill to
              know what should be done with it. He rose simply to state that the Committee on Public
              Buildings are now engaged in examining the office of the Secretary of State, and
              contemplate its removal into the office of the Adjutant General. On his motion the

              <p>Pending the roll-call - </p>
              <p>Mr. Ringo, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: I am opposed
                to licensing saloons and I want the public to know that; but as long as we are
                cursed with these things I think the neighborhoods that have to deal with them
                should have the benefit of the money paid by them for license fees. My county is a
                mining county and perhaps has as many saloons in it as any county in the State that
                has no city in it, and also has as many poor people and as many children to school
                in proportion to the number of its inhabitants. The tax on saloon licenses collected
                in our county goes into the public school fund while I understand Hendricks county
                has not a saloon in it, and other counties which are not cursed with saloons share
                the benefit of the saloon tax collected in my county. I vote "no."</p>
              <p>Mr. Gooding in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said: I think the
                people who have to endure the afflictions of drinking saloons ought to be allowed to
                retain the money derived from the licensing of such places for the purposes of
                eradicating the evil. I therefore vote "no."</p>
              <p>The vote was then, announced as above recorded.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregg, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> returned Mr. Hough's

              <p>Mr. O'Brien, from the <orgName>Committee on County and Township Business</orgName>,

                it be indefinitely postponed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Beeson, from the <orgName>Committee on Reformatory Institutions</orgName>,

              <p>Mr. Slater moved that the report be laid on the table.</p>

          <dateline rend="center">
            <date>SATURDAY, February 8, 1873 - 10 o'clock a.m.</date>
          </dateline>
          <p>The President <hi rend="i">pro tem.,</hi> Hon. Geo. W. Friedley took the Chair and
            directed a call of the Senate to ascertain if a quorum be present.</p>
          <p>It was taken and but 21 Senators answered to their names.</p>
          <p>Mr. Dwiggins resisted the order of the Chair claiming the presumption to be that on the
            meeting each morning a quorum is present.</p>
          <p>Mr. Chapman and Mr. Williams combatted this proposition and sustained the ruling of the
            Chair.</p>
          <p>Mr. Rhodes contended that on each day the order of business must be commenced and
            proceeded with as laid down in the rules.</p>
          <p>The President pro tem. said: I think it was the duty of the presiding officer on taking
            the Chair this morning to direct a call of the Senate and believing that to be the duty
            of the Chair I stated I supposed that to be correct in the hearing of the Senate. I made
            that statement in order to afford Senators an opportunity if they thought it incorrect
            to interpose an objection, but no objection was interposed. The view of the Chair seemed
            to be the view taken by Senators present at that time and I therefore directed a call of
            the Senate. I believe that was all that could have been done under the circumstances.
            Before the adjournment yesterday we had a call of the Senate which demonstrated the fact
            that there was not a quorum present, and had we remained here from three o'clock till
            six it would not have been competent to do any business until that call was disposed of.
            Now the question is whether an adjournment will dispense with a call of the Senate? I am
            clearly of the opinion that it will not. I am clearly of the opinion that by an
            adjournment we do not dispense with a call of the Senate pending. The Chair thinks that
            we are compelled when we next come together to proceed with a call of the Senate,
            because pending a call of the Senate we can do no other business but send for absentees
            or adjourn.</p>
          <p>Mr. Dwiggins had not intended to cast any reflection upon the presiding officer, but
            thought if nothing else could be done the question might be discussed. He insisted that
            if no quorum be present no motion can be entertained, but it is-the duty of the Chair to
            adjourn the body.</p>
          <p>Mr. Chapman has heretofore contended that in the absence of a quorum no motion is in
            order. The rule and the Constitution is that when there is no quorum present and the
            Chair finds it out, it is the duty of the Chair to adjourn the Senate without any
            motion. He read from Cushing's Manual of Parliamentary Practice as follows :</p>
          <p>"No business can regularly be entered upon until a quorum is present; nor can any
            business be regularly proceeded with when it appears that the members present are
            reduced below that number; consequently the presiding officer ought not to take the
            Chair until the proper number is ascertained to be present, and if, at any time in the
            course of the proceedings, notice is taken that a quorum is not present, and, upon the
            members being counted by the presiding officer, such appears to be the fact, the
            assembly must be immediately adjourned."</p>
          <p>The President pro tem. I call attention to rule second of the Senate, for we are
            governed by these rules. It reads as follows:</p>
          <p>"Nine Senators with the President, or ten in his absence, having chosen a President pro
            tem., shall be authorized to call a Senate, compell the attendance of absent Senators,
            make an order for their fine or censure and may adjourn."</p>
          <p>Now we may adjourn on the motion of the Chair it seems to me, or on the motion of any
            member of the Senate. Our rule don't prescribe the manner by which we shall adjourn, or
            how that question shall be raised. There are just two things we are competent to do
            without a quorum, one is to send for absentees and deal with them afterwards; the other
            is to adjourn. We may do these with a less number than a quorum, but these are the only
            things we can do; and it don't seem to me to be material whether the Chair adjourns the
            Senate upon his own motion or upon the motion of some Senator.</p>
          <p>Mr. Hubbard moved to adjourn.</p>
          <p>The motion was agreed to, and the President declared the adjournment to be till 10
            o'clock Monday morning.</p>
          <p>The House of Representatives not in session. </p>

            <p>The Lieutenant Governor took the chair and, after prayers by Mr. Clark, a
              representative from Hamilton county desired the reading of the Secretary's journal of
              Friday's proceedings, pending which a message from the House of Representatives was
              announced.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown thereupon suggested that on the last roll call no quorum was present.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dittemore also rising to the same point of order, the Lieutenant Governor said we
              could go along with the reading of the journal, unless the Senator insisted on his
              point of order, and in a short time, no doubt, a quorum would appear.Mr. Dittemore and
              Mr. Brown acquiesced.</p>
            <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, proposed to amend the journal.</p>
            <p>The Lieutenant Governor said it would lie on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown demanded a call of the Senate, or rather, he moved that the roll call be
              continued that it may be ascertained whether a quorum be present.</p>
            <p>A call of the Senate was ordered, and being taken, discovered but thirty-three
              Senators present and answering to their names.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dittemore moved to send for absentees.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved to amend by ordering the doors closed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dittemore accepted the amendment.</p>
            <p>Mr. Glessner believed all Senators now in the city were present, and thought it
              unnecessary to send after absentees.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown moved to adjourn.</p>
            <p>The motion was agreed to, upon a division; affirmative 17; negative not announced. So

            <p>Mr. Smith's bill [S. 83] defining the offense of libel, making the same a

            <p>Mr. Smith's bill [S. 90] to amend section 26 of the act of May 14, 1852, regulating

            <p>The Lieutenant Governor stating the first question to be on laying the bill on the

              <p>Mr. Orr's bill [S. 117] regulating the granting of divorces, was read the second

              <p>Mr. Dittemore moved to amend by inserting one year instead of three years, where
                the words "habitual drunkenness" occur. He regarded it as outrageous to compel a
                woman to live with an habitual drunkard for three years.</p>
              <p>Mr. Sleeth moved to amend the amendment by making the time two years instead of
                one.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Slater, the amendment to the amendment was laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hall moved to lay the amendment on the table also.</p>
              <p>The motion was rejected by yeas 18, nays 25.</p>
              <p>Mr. Friedley of Lawrence, moved to refer the bill to the <orgName>Judiciary

                clause in the present law.</p>
              <p>Mr. Chapman moved to lay the amendment on the table. This motion was rejected by
                yeas 20, nays 22.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins said it was well known that Indiana was a stench in the nostrils of
                everybody because of her divorce laws. Persons who come here to get a divorce should
                remain here two years at least, which should be proven by residents in the county
                where application for divorce is made. Now the affidavit known to be false even by
                the Judge himself is made by non residents, and divorces are obtained by perjury and
                falsehoods known to be so at the time. Persons from abroad should not be allowed to
                come here and impose on our courts.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott moved to add instructions to the Committee to strike out of the second
                section all after the word "illegitimate."</p>
              <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, said this "bill would be open to the same objection
                urged against the present law, which, as a general thing, the people were satisfied
                with. He thought the people would be perfectly well satisfied with the present law
                if the omnibus section, as it is called, or seventh clause were stricken out.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough opposed the motion to refer, and declared the Senator for Lawrence county
                was mistaken in saying the people of the State were satisfied with the present
                divorce law. Mr. Scott withdrew his amendment.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins demanded a division of the question; first on the motion to refer to
                the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>.</p>
              <p>It was rejected by - yeas, 17; nays, 26.</p>
              <p>Mr. Rhodes moved to amend Mr. Dittemore's amendment by inserting habitual
                drunkenness of either party, or the failure of the husband to make provision for his
                family, being the present statute.</p>
              <p>It was agreed to upon a division - affirmative 27; negative not counted.</p>
              <p>The amendment as amended was agreed to.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dittemore now moved to strike out the word "freeholder" in section 7. Mr. Hall
                moved to lay this amendment on the table, which was agreed to.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele desired an amendment that the applicant shall file an affidavit that he
                has been a boni fide resident for the time prescribed by the law.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott renewed his amendment to strike out of the second section all after the
                word "illegitimate" - so the mother shall not bear the burden of the offspring. The
                party in the wrong should bear the burden. Such an amendment would be one of the
                strongest safeguards of this law. When the father knows he is acting wrongfully in
                marrying, this amendment would make the child inherit from the father.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gooding moved an amendment to the amendment that the child shall inherit from
                the father, whether he knew he was in the wrong or not.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough objected to these amendments, because the children would stand before the
                world as illegitimate while inheriting from both father and mother.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott modified his amendment as a substitute for all amendments pending, so as
                to strike <pb n="147" xml:id="VAA8558-14-147"/> out all after the words "to be," in
                the second line, and add the word "legitimate."</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough opposed this amendment.</p>
              <p>The substitute amendment was adopted.</p>
              <p>Mr. Sleeth moved an amendment adding to section 7 that "the plaintiff with his
                petition shall file an affidavit stating where he has resided for two years
                past."</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved that the bill be engrossed, and upon that motion demanded the
                previous question.</p>
              <p>The demand for the previous question was seconded by the Senate, and the main
                question was ordered.</p>
              <p>The bill was ordered to be engrossed by yeas 28, nays, 14.</p>

              <head rend="center">RIGHTS OF MARRIED WOMEN.</head>
              <p>Mr. Hubbard's bill [S. 128] relative to the rights and powers of married women, was
                read the second time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Daggy moved that the bill be indefinitely postponed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hubbard said that the bill was almost an exact copy of the law of Michigan
                since 1865, and contains a clause that there need be no intervention of a trustee in
                cases of deeds passing between husbands and wives. There it renders a married woman
                who has property, liable for general debts chargeable upon that property.</p>
              <p>Mr. Daggy opposed so great an innovation on the law of the country. This bill would
                authorize married women to go out and trade as they please. The title should be "to
                create and keep up confusion in households."</p>
              <p>The motion to indefinitely postpone was agreed to by yeas 21, nays 21, the

              <p>Mr. Hall's bill [S. 130] to establish a sanitarium was read the second time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hall proposed a new section authorizing the receipt of donations.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele moved that the bill and pending amendments be indefinitely
                postponed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hall said Massachusetts has two sanitariums, and is building a third. New York
                has four. They take a poor drunken sot out of the gutter and make a man out of
                him.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele made the motion because all the money the State can spare will be needed
                for the support of benevolent institutions already established. He thought we had
                better go a little slow.</p>
              <p>Mr. Thompson thought this bill deserved more attention, for he believed there never
                was a more popular proposition in the towns and cities than this.</p>
              <p>Mr.Orr heartily agreed with the statement that the State was now called upon for
                more appropriations than the Treasury can stand, and he would rather see the bill
                laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Slater demanded the previous question. The demand was seconded.</p>
              <p>The main question was ordered by the Senate, and under the operations of the

              "A bill for an act for the regulation of weights and measures." He said: This is a
              bill to regulate the weight of grains, seeds, etc., and it is the effort of the bill
              to correct the irregular classification of the articles in the statutes. The
              substitute changes only one or two items, such as making the weight of a bushel of
              corn in the ear seventy pounds instead of sixty-eight pounds, etc.) The report was
              concurred in and the substituted bill was passed to the second reading.</p>

            <p>Mr. Lenfesty spoke in reply to Mr. Offutt. The system is wrong. The law provides that
              these officers shall not employ counsel. What did the House, but the other day, when
              it authorized the Attorney General to enjoin the Calamet Dam Works? It simply agreed
              to pay the attorneys. This system, I say is wrong. What we want here is a law refusing
              these outside employments. He utterly disavowed and disclaimed the idea that a member

              of the claim they may report on.</p>

            <p>Mr. Buskirk desired respectfully to ask the committee to make a statement of the

            <p>Mr. Riggs. This is a joint Committee composed of members of both Houses. These claims
              are put in and acted on after the claimants have been before the Committee. The
              Committee have taken the trouble to subpoena witnesses in every case; and I can assure
              the House that there is not one of these claims but has been thoroughly investigated -
              the members of the Committee on the part of the Senate being perhaps more thorough in
              their work than those on the part of the House.</p>
            <p>Mr. Smith moved to reconsider the vote just taken non-concurring in the report on the
              claim of Holland &amp; Binckley, so that the consideration of all these claims
              together may go over till to-morrow.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cobb said, that amongst those who testified to the reasonableness of these
              charges before the Committee was Governor Hendricks. It was in evidence that the
              attorneys on the other side got nearly twice as much as these parties have charged the
              State. It is the opinion of the Committee that all these claims are equally just, one
              no more than the other.</p>
            <p>Mr. Woollen stated his admission of some good reason, perhaps, for non-concurrence in
              these reports, whilst he himself was inclined to concur in them. These are cases
              involving investigations of facts and records. The committee can do that, whilst the
              House can not. The difficulty here teaches us one thing: that the Attorney General
              should do this business, and save these charges against the State. But these
              employments have been made, the service has been rendered, and it is not for us to say
              the State should not allow the compensation; and all such cases, of course, should be
              heard without partisan bias. He considered that all these claims should go over
              together, for a decision after the House shall be satisfied as to the justice in each
              case.</p>
            <p>Mr. Walker also disclaimed the idea of distinctions and favoritisms on account of

                being on the second reading.</p>
              <p>Mr. Wynn proposed to amend the first section by striking out the two provisos and
                inserting: "Provided said deputies shall give bonds in the sum of $2,000 for the
                faithful discharge of their duties."Mr. Shirley saw not the necessity for the
                amendment, unless it were to destroy the bill. There were two objects of the bill:
                one to require the assessors to select their deputies from the elected appraisers in
                1872, so far as they are qualified, and the other as to the compensation of the
                appraisers and their deputies, which it reduces from $5 a day, under the old law, to
                $4 for the assessors, and $3 a day for their deputies. Tabled.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brett. I shall move to amend the bill by striking out all that portion which
                requires these appointments by the assessors. We might almost as well repeal the law
                itself as to meddle with its provisions in this way. As to the provision about
                compensation, that may be well enough; but that with regard to the appointment of
                deputies is impracticable. The gentleman says - so far as they are competent. That
                would be a very delicate question to settle by the assessor. If we amend the bill in
                this way, the object of the assessment act will be defeated. Better leave the matter
                of these appointments where they are - with the auditors and assessors. Such was the
                feeling in his county.</p>

              <p>Mr. Walker opposed the proposition from the consideration that just the few
                railroad bills which have been ordered to be printed have cost the State some $1,500
                for the limited number of copies which we ordered. If such is the cost of printing
                now he thought we ought to be careful about making these orders.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brett concurred. He said also that the assessors will furnish to the tax payers
                in their blank lists the information as to everything which they require to know of
                the assessment act, both with regard to real and personal property. Not one in
                10,000 of the voters of the State would read the tenth part of that act, if it were
                printed and sent to them.</p>

                resolution, involving the propriety of building a new State House at this time, by
                requiring the <orgName>Joint Committee on Public Buildings</orgName> to report a
                bill for that purpose.</p>
              <p>Mr. Peed submitted considerations like this: That if a new capitol building is to
                be erected within five or six years, the initiatory steps should be taken at this
                session.</p>
              <p>Mr. Lenfesty was decidedlv opposed to any movement in that direction, so long as
                the State felt itself too poor to furnish an additional asylum for the incurably
                insane. The people are demanding that these unfortunates should be cared for: the
                session was drawing to a close, whilst this demand was pressed upon us with <pb
                  n="150" xml:id="VAA8558-14-150"/> the knowledge that many of these unfortunates
                were locked in the county jails for the want of a better home.</p>
              <p>Mr. Walker spoke in favor of the d ption of the resolution, and Mr. Glasgow opposed
                it.</p>
              <p>Mr. Peed demanded the yeas and nays, which being taken resulted - yeas, 39; nays,
                41.</p>
              <p>So the concurrent resolution was rejected.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Willard, the Senate amendment to his Second District Court bill
                [H. R. 361], viz: "declaring an emergency," was taken up and concurred in.</p>
              <p>The Speaker next took up Mr. Cobb's bill [H. R. 217], to amend the act of February
                12, 1852, concerning promissory notes, and declaring an emergency - there being a
                majority and minority report thereon - the former to lay the bill on the table and
                the latter recommending its passage; the question being on the adoption of the
                report of the minority of the committee, it was rejected, and then the report of the
                majority was concurred in and the bill laid on the table; yeas 48, nays 21.</p>
              <p>The Speaker next took up Mr. Woodward's bill [H. R. 323], providing for the payment
                of the township trustees all moneys which may have been collected from the township
                for specific purposes, and providing penalty for the violation of this act, it being
                on the third reading.</p>
              <p>Mr. Billingslyy called attention to the severe penalty - $500 to $1,000 - the law
                now requires such moneys to be paid to the trustees at the proper time, but this
                bill requires them to be paid on demand of the trustees.</p>
              <p>Mr. Walker referred to a bill of this title that was vetoed by Gov. Baker.</p>
              <p>Mr. Woodard. The objections in the veto are removed in this bill; and so far as the
                penalty is concerned, the man acting under the sanctity and solemnity of an official
                oath ought to suffer for the violation of it. Rejected - yeas 8, nays 66.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Edwards of Lawrence, the bill [S. 15] to authorize cities and
                towns to negotiate and sell bonds ($40,000) to procure means with which to erect or
                complete unfinished buildings, and purchase of grounds and buildings for school
                purposes; and for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds; and
                legalizing such contracts heretofore entered into, and declaring an emergency, was
                taken up on the third reading.</p>
              <p>Mr. Edwards, of Lawrence, represented that this bill is intended simply to legalize
                the title of the act of 1869, which, as an amendment of the act of 1867, improperly
                sets forth the title thereof. It simply amends the second title, and so authorizes
                persons outside transferred to cities or towns for school purposes to enjoy the
                benefits of such schools.</p>
              <p>Mr. Henderson said his amendment to the bill, which was adopted by the House, makes
                the maximum of such loans $50,000, instead of $40,000.</p>
              <p>The Speaker. The amendment will be engrossed; but the bill is without an enacting
                clause. It will be passed over informally.</p>
              <p>Mr. Bowser, by unanimous consent, returned from the <orgName>Committee on
                  Railroads</orgName> the bill [S. 10] to amend section 58 of the city corporators
                act of March 14, 1869, recommending its passage. It was ordered to the third
                reading.</p>

          <p>The Lieutenant Governor took the chair, and announced prayers by the Rev. I. C. Smith,
            of the M. E. Church.</p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. Scott, the order of business was suspended, and Senate bills on the
            second reading were taken up.</p>
          <p>Mr. O'Brien's bill [S. 229] to legalize the acts of the Trustees of the town of Cicero,
            in Hamilton county, was read the second time.</p>

          <p>Mr. Dwiggins having been requested to do so, (as Mr. O'Brien has been an attorney in

          <p>Mr. Beeson's bill [S. 195] defining misdemeanor and prescribing a penalty therefor - to

          <p>Mr. Beeson explained that where county commissioners of any county passed an order in

            <p>The Lieutenant Governor announced the special order,being the consideration of Mr.
              O'Brien's State Printing and Binding bill [S. 257] with the majority and minority
              reports thereon - the latter recommending the passage of Mr. Beardsley 's bill [S.
              245] to let the printing to the lowest bidder, with sundry amendments. The question
              being on concurring in the report of the minority-</p>
            <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, moved to refer the bill and reports thereon to the
                <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>.</p>
            <p>Mr. Glessner was of opinion that the Senate should decide which system shall be
              adopted, before the matter is referred to a committee.</p>
            <p>Mr. O'Brien, Chairman of the <orgName>Committee on Printing</orgName>, said this
              matter has been before his committee since the commencement of the special session,
              and it was known that the State has been largely swindled in the matter of the public
              printing, for that is a matter of public record in the courts of justice. In the
              examination of the subject he found that the State has been swindled by raised
              vouchers, and there is a suspicion that the State has been swindled by false
              affidavitsthough he believed the courts acquitted the accused of the charge; and the
              State has been swindled in the measurement of the amount of printing done, and been
              swindled by parties getting orders for printing through here, which was done at the
              expense of the State with the State's material, which is as useless as dirt, and which
              has cost the State thousands of dollars. He referred to the Adjutant General's report
              which cost the State some eighty-odd thousand dollars. The Auditor of State, in his
              last report, says that the State has been swindled out of $150,000enough to buy any
              three printing offices in the State of Indiana. The State Auditor might have increased
              that amount $150,000 more and it would probably be nearer the truth. Mr. O'Brien
              thought the State in the last ten years has been swindled out of $300,000 in the item
              of printing alone. This thing occurs in various ways, and one of the ways is by a
              collusion between printers and stationers in the purchase of material, by which twice
              and three times, and he thought as much as twelve prices has been paid by the State.
              Then in the matter of stationery for the General Assembly, the last Legislature cost
              the State $17,000, and the special session footed up about $12,000 in addition for the
              single item of stationery. Then the contracts for repairing public buildings no one
              knows anything about. The State has been saved some $8,000 or $10,000 recently by the
              vigilance of some State officer. The State Auditor reports that the public printing;
              for the past ten years has cost some $455,000, and <pb n="152" xml:id="VAA8558-14-152"
              /> adding the cost of printing the Adjutant General's report to this sum,would run
              that item up to over $530,000, which makes this item of printing cost the State
              $53,000 per annum.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hall moved to refer both bills and reports to the <orgName>Judiciary
                Committee</orgName> with instructions to report a bill providing that the State
              printing shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder.</p>

            <p>Mr. O'Brien moved to change the instructions by authorizing the committee to bring in
              a bill regulating the Public Printing.</p>
            <p>Mr. Scott thought it best for the Senate to choose between a State printing
              establishment and letting the public printing to the lowest bidder, before referring
              the subject to a committee.</p>
            <p>On motion by Mr. Williams, the motion [Mr. O'Brien's] was laid on the table by yeas
              26, nays 14.</p>
            <p>Mr. O'Brien protested against the motion now pending, assigning as a reason that the
              committee has done its best, and has reported to the Senate that its judgment</p>
            <p>Mr. Slater intimated that the committee were a unit on either till the Senate may
              select.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hough could see no use in re-committing this matter. Let the Senate concur now in
              either the majority or the minority report. As a member of the <orgName>Committee on
                Printing</orgName>, he hoped the Senate would choose between the two bills, because
              they reflect the views of the committee on the two systems proposed therein.</p>
            <p>On motion by Mr. Dittemore, the motion to recommit with instructions was laid on the

              <p>Mr. Steele called up his motion to reconsider the vote by which the bill [S. 33] to
                amend the charter of the Indiana Fire and Marine Insuranse Company was passed. Mr.
                S. said the bill would extend the charter of that company for all time to come, and
                gave other reasons why such a bill should not be passed.</p>
              <p>Mr. O'Brien also urged objections - understanding, among other things, that there
                was no personal liability clause in the charter.Mr. Hubbard was of opinion that no
                safe business can be done under the general insurance laws of this State, and he
                recollected no change from the old charter, except that this bill gives the company
                banking privileges, and the right <pb n="153" xml:id="VAA8558-14-153"/> to transact
                life as well as fire insurance business.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele said the truth is, it is substantially a new charter.</p>
              <p>Mr. Harney understood this bill to be galvanizing into life an old charter that had
                become obsolete, and he regarded such attempts as wrong.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dittemore moved, ineffectually, to lay on the table the motion to reconsider p-
                yeas 14, nays 26.</p>
              <p>The vote by which the bill was passed was reconsidered, by yeas 30, nays 10.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Hubbard, the bill was recommitted to the <orgName>Judiciary

              <p>Mr. Steele's bill [S. 192] to amend section 5 of the property execution act of Feb.
                17, 1852, was read the second time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele explained the provision of his bill. Engrossed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Daggy's bill [S. 203] to authorize the appointment of resident trustees to hold
                trust funds out of this State belonging to persons in this State, was read the

              <p>Mr. Beeson called up the bill pending at the time the special order came up this
                morning, being his bill [S. 195] with reference to the running at large of animals.
                It was read the second time this morning.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved to indefinitely postpone it.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele favored the motion, preferring objections to the bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. Beeson was sure opponents to the bill misunderstood its provisions and
                intentions. He had seen unruly animals running at large to the terror of all passers
                by, and endangering the lives of people in the neighborhood, which animals, under
                this bill, the owner would have to restrain. It is a measure appealing to the good
                judgment of all, and he hoped it would pass.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hubbard had not been importuned more upon any other question, except the
                Kankakee Valley drainage matter, and he believed public sentiment was ready for this
                step.</p>
              <p>Mr. O'Brien opposed making any more crimes than are absolutely necessary. There is
                now a statute making it a criminal offense to allow the running at large of a
                dangerous animal, and this bill should be defeated.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner thought it would be better to enact more criminal statutes than we
                have. This is an important bill, and it need not work hardships in any county.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins believed the workings of this bill, if enacted into a law, would prove
                a serious inconvenience in many counties in the State. He objected to the principle
                of enforcing civil remedies by criminal process.</p>
              <p>Mr. Bunyan demanded the previous question, and there being a second - </p>
              <p>The motion to indefinitely postpone the bill was rejected by yeas, 18; nays,
                24.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Armstrong, the emergency clause was stricken out.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved to amend the bill so as to prohibit dangerous animals from
                running at large.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner moved to lay it on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Fuller moved to lay the whole subject on the table.</p>
              <p>The latter motion rejected by yeas 17, nays 25.</p>
              <p>The amendment was also laid on the table by yeas 22, nays 19.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hubbard demanded the previous question on the engrossment of the bill.</p>
              <p>The Senate seconded the demand. Ordered engrossed by yeas 23, nays 17.</p>
              <p>Mr. Beardsley's bill [S. 219] to provide for the construction and maintenance of

                      attached, I have the honor to state that my opinion is we have no
                      Constitutional proviso prohibiting "an unmarried female," from holding the
                      office of State Librarian, it being an office created by Legislative
                      enactments.</p>
                    <p>We have what may be termed political common law fixed by immemorial usage
                      which might prohibit a female from holding such office. This prohibition may
                      be removed by Legislative enactment. The bill now pending being House Bill No.
                      379, will legalize and make valid the election of Mrs. Sarah E. Oren.</p>

            <head rend="center">MILK SICKNESS.</head>
            <p>Mr. Hardesty submitted a preamble and resolution reciting the prevalance and fatality
              of milk sickness in the State, the duty of the State to protect the lives of the
              citizens, and the fact that one A. J. Richardson claims to have discovered the cause
              of said disease, and which, if made known, can be made available by any person of
              common understanding; and, therefore, instructing the Committee on Rights and
              Privileges to inquire into the cause of milk sickness and the possibility of
              eradicating the same; and that said committee call before them the said A. J.
              Richardson to say what he knows about it, and report a bill for providing a suitable
              reward to any person who shall discover the cause of milk sickness.</p>
            <p>Mr. Butterworth hoped the resolution would be promptly rejected. It was a disgrace to
              the State to advertise in this way that the State is infested with milk sickness - a
              thing unknown to medicine, and perhaps not heard of in many counties of the State.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardesty alleged that the milksickness was known in the counties of Madison,
              Henry, Delaware, and in many other counties; and, although this disease of
              milksickness might not be recognized by the medical professional was known to the
              legislation of the country. The State of Kentucky had offered a reward for the
              discovery of the cause of this disease, and this resolution should go to the committee
              for examination and report. Adopted - affirmative 42. negative 34.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kimball introduced a bill [H. R. 482] supplementary to the act to provide for the
              election, fixing the compensation, and prescribing the duties of the Attorney General
              of the State, approved February 21, 1855, and to repeal the act to amend sections four
              and and seven of said act, approved June 3, 1861; and prescribing additional duties of
              clerks of the Circuit Courts and of District and Prosecuting Attorneys. Referred to
              the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>.</p>

            <p>Mr. Billingsby submitted a resolution for an order (which was adopted) requesting the

            <p>The Speaker announced the claims reports special order, and it was passed over
              informally.</p>
            <p>Mr. Whitworth's bill [H. R. 447] to amend section 1 of the road laws of 1867, was
              taken up, read the second time and ordered to the engrossment.</p>
            <p>A call of the House determined seventy-one members - a quorum - present.</p>

            <div type="section">
              <head rend="center">CLAIMS.</head>
              <p>The Speaker returned to the special order, viz.: the consideration of the several
                claims reported yesterday for allowance by the joint committee on claims; and first,
                the claim of Barbour &amp; Jacobs of $2,800 for legal services, of which the
                committee report for the allowance of $1,600, the question being on the amendment of
                Mr. Butterworth to Mr. Peed's amendment, to strike out $1,600 and insert $500 in
                lieu: and a division of the question being demanded, the question was on striking
                out.</p>
              <p>After debate by Messrs Peed, Dial and Barrett, the latter moving, ineffectually,
                for indefinite postponement, the motion to strike out was agreed to - yeas 47, nays
                36.</p>
              <p>Mr. Butterworth's motion to fill the blank with $1,000 was agreed to, and the
                report of the joint committee, as amended concurred in.</p>
              <p>The next bill in the special order, viz: the claim of McDonald, Butler &amp;
                McDonald, upon which the joint committee reported for its allowance $250, was
                concurred in by the House on a division - affirmative 60, negative 26.</p>
              <p>The next was the claim of Holland and Binckley for professional services in the
                case of the State against Michael Batchelder, late defaulting Treasurer for Franklin
                county, $2,359 15 upon which the joint committee report allowance.</p>
              <p>After debate, by Mr. Given against the report, and Mr. Wilson, of Ripley, in favor
                of it, who stated that above $2,000 of the amount recovered by these parties have
                been paid into the treasury as the result of their prosecution of this case, Messrs.
                Peed and Barrett spoke further in opposition, and Messrs. Cobb and Walker in favor
                of the report.</p>
              <p>Mr. Peed moved to amend the report by striking out $2,359 15 and inserting $1,000
                in lieu.Mr. Cowgill moved ineffectually to lay the amendment on the table. Yeas, 15;
                nays, 25.</p>
              <p>A division of the question being demanded, the motion to strike out was agreed to -
                yeas, 62; nays, 13.</p>
              <p>Mr. Wilson of Ripley proposed to fill the blank writh $2,000; which, on motion of
                Mr. Barrett, was laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Troutman proposed $1,200.</p>
              <p>Mr. Cowgill moved to amend the amendment by inserting $1,800, which, on motion of
                Mr. Blocher, was laid on the table; and the question recurred on filling the blank
                with $1,200, which, on motion of Mr. Given, was also laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hatch proposed to fill the blank with $1,000, which was agreed to, and the
                report of the joint committee thus amended was concurred in</p>
              <p>The next item in the special order was the report of the joint committee on claims
                for the allowance of $250 to J. S. Buckles for money paid to the State for swamp
                lands, which the State did not own at the time, and to which said Buckles has
                received no title. The papers in the case were all read by the Clerk.</p>
              <p>Mr. Schmuck inquired if this claim has ever been at any time previous to this
                session of the Legislature presented here for allowance.</p>
              <p>Mr. Cobb. It has not. There is no doubt the State got Mr. Buckles' money for land
                it did not own.</p>
              <p>Mr. Schmuck. It seems strange that this gentleman should let his claim rest for
                fourteen years without presenting it. I think the matter should be referred to the
                  <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>, with instructions to inquire
                further about it.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hatch moved, ineffectually, to lay the report on the table. The House then
                concurred ia the report of the committee without a division.</p>
              <p>The House then adjourned.</p>

            <p>The Lieutenant Governor announced prayers by the Rev. Mr. James Rudder, a
              Representative from the county of Washington, and a minister of the Christian
              Church.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sarnighausen offered a resolution requesting committees to recite the reasons for
              their reports.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Dittemore it was laid on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. Collett presented temperance petitions from Pike county, which were referred to
              the <orgName>Committee on Temperance</orgName>.</p>
            <p>Mr. Taylor and Mr. Sarnighausen presented similar petitions, which took the same
              course.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Dittemore, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of Senate bills
              on the third reading.</p>
            <p>Mr. Haworth's bill [S. 64] for the collection and publication of statistics -
              requiring the Secretary of State to establish a Bureau of Statistics for the
              collection of information concerning agriculture, mining, manufacturing, education,
              crime, and public statistics with reference to births, marriages, deaths, and other
              vital and social statistics - was read the third time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hall stated that the bill was introduced last session at the suggestion of
              Governor Baker. The one single item of forfeiture of bails will more than amply
              compensate the State in the amount that will be recovered by the State. The whose cost
              of the bill will fail short of $3,000 a year, and the amount of information it will
              bring to light for use in foreign countries will be almost invaluable.</p>
            <p>Mr. Neff moved to recommit the bill with instructions to strike out the clause
              authorizing the Secretary of State to employ additional clerks.</p>
            <p>Mr. Haworth opposed this motion, believing it would cripple the bill, the provisions
              of which he explained, urging reasons for its passage additional to those presented by
              Mr. Hall. The recent Governor, it was understood, had expended several hundred dollars
              out of his own pocket to obtain information that this bill would collect.</p>
            <p>Mr. Collett spoke in favor of this measure, expressing the general desire that the
              progress of the State and her mineral wealth should be published to the world.</p>
            <p>Mr. Neff disclaimed any desire to throw any obstacle in the passage of the bill, and
              therefore withdrew his motion.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown thought portions of the bill, which require a great of work and expense,
              would not redound to the credit of the State, but were of a private nature and
              referring to matters the publication of which are not desirable, especially at so
              great cost.</p>
            <p>Bill passed - yeas, 28; nays, 16.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gooding's bill [S. 160] to amend the charter of the Lawrenceburgh Insurance
              Company, was read the third time.</p>
            <p>Mr. G. explained that the bill changed the name and place of choosing electors, and
              allowed the capital stock to be increased above $100,000.In answer to a query by Mr.
              Sleeth, Mr. Dittemore said that the charter has not been forfeited by non-user.</p>
            <p>The bill passed the Senate by yeas 35, nays 8.Mr. Dwiggins' bill [S. 56] to amend
              sections 22 and 27 of the town incorporation act, coming up - </p>
            <p>Mr. Dwiggins was willing to take Mr. Hough's bill [S. 49] on the same subject, and
              moved that his bill [S. 56] be laid on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. Scott's bill, [S. 162] to repeal an act repealing section 31 of an act concerning
              real property, approved May 6, 1869, and to authorize the records of deeds or
              transcripts thereof to be read in evidence in courts of justice, was read the third
              time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Scott explained that this bill restored the thirty-first section referred to in
              the title.</p>
            <p>Bill passed the Senate, yeas 40, nays 0.</p>
            <p>Mr. Collett's bill, [S. 95] to prevent the carrying of concealed weapons, was read
              the third time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Collett explained that this bill includes a number of deadly weapons not now
              enumerated in the statutes. Judges say that most murders are committed because of the
              carrying of concealed deadly weapons, and this bill is intended to stop the growing
              evil.</p>
            <p>Bill passed the Senate, yeas 36, nays 6.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dwiggins' bill, [S. 116] to amend sections 95, 96 and 97 of the act of June 17,
              1852, in relation to the settlement of decedents' estates, and legali- <pb n="157"

              foreign administrators, was read the third time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dwiggins explained its provisions.</p>
            <p>Bill passed the Senate, yeas 42, nays 1.</p>
            <p>Mr. Taylor's bill, [S. 105] to authorize courts of common pleas to determine who the
              heirs, legatees or distributees of a decedent are, and to order a partial distribution
              of his estate prior to the final settlement of the estate, was read the third
              time.</p>
            <p>The bill passed the Senate by yeas 42, nays 1.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thompson's bill [S. 94] providing that in cities having incorporated homes for
              friendless women, all lines collected on account of and for the breach of any
              ordinance for the suppression of vice, shall be paid to the trustees of such homes for
              their maintenance and support, was read the third time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thompson explained his bill, and made appeals in behalf of its benevolent
              provisions.</p>
            <p>The bill passed - yeas 43, nays 0.</p>
            <p>Hr. Hough's bill [S. 49] to amend sections 22 and 58 of the town incorporation act,
              approved June 11, 1852, was read the third time and passed the Senate - yeas 37, nays
              5.</p>
            <p>The bill authorizes incorporated towns to exact a license fee of $100 a year from
              liquor sellers, and fifty dollars a year from keepers of public billiard tables.</p>
            <p>Mr. Rhodes' bill [S. 127] in relation to collection of notes or contracts given in
              payment for patent rights, was read the third time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown moved to recommit the bill to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>,
              with instructions to strike out the second section.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hubbard opposed the bill, urging reasons why such law should never go upon the
              statute book.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dwiggins also spoke against this bill, agreeing with Mr. Hubbard that it was a
              blow against the entire commercial system of the Stale. The true theory of law is that
              where a man makes a contract he is bound by that contract.</p>
            <p>Mr. Rhodes did not think his bill was such a terrible thing as Senators seem to
              think. He desired to so legislate as to protect the people against the patent right
              sharpers that are prowling about all over this State, and believed this bill would do
              so effectually. This is a bill in the interest of the people, and he hoped it would
              become a law. When he had concluded - </p>
            <p>The Senate took a recess till two o'clock.</p>

            <head rend="center"> AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
            <p> The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill S. 127 pending at the time of the
              recess.</p>
            <p>Mr. Harney favored the passage of the bill as a means of stopping this class of
              villiany practiced by patent right vendors.</p>
            <p>Mr. Boone understood that this kind of paper is not presented at the banks, and that
              this bill will not affect the character of true commercial paper, as some Senators
              seemed to fear.</p>
            <p>Mr. Neff was satisfied that the people of the State need some protection of the kind
              proposed in this bill, and believed the people should have protection even if it
              struck down commercial paper. However, he was willing the bill should go to a
              committee for a perfection.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gooding said the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> had carefully examined
              the bill and recommended its passage; and that committee could not further perfect the
              bill unless amendment were suggested by the Senate. He believed in striking at this
              gigantic fraud, and that the bill was well guarded.</p>
            <p>On motion by Mr. Dittemore the motion to recommit was laid on the table. Yeas, 32;
              nays, 11.</p>
            <p>Mr. Steele thought something should be done in this way to protect the people,
              especially those living remote from the centre of the State, from the stupendous
              swindling operations of patent right villains who are perambulating the country
              seeking whom, they may deceive. He believed there were half a million of such notes in
              circulation in Indiana. He would favor sending all such scoundrels to the penitentiary
              for a term of not less than two years.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hough moved for and obtained consent to amend the bill by inserting a clause in
              these words: "or taken in the course of or under the pretense of establishing an
              agency for the sale of any agricultural or other implement."</p>
            <p>The bill, as amended, passed the Senate by - yeas, 35; nays, 7.</p>

            <p>Mr. Bowman's bill [S. 155] to provide for the reimbursement of certain counties
              therein named moneys illegally paid into the State Treasury in the year 1869, was read
              the third time and passed the Senate by yeas 38, nays 3.</p>
            <p>Mr. Rhodes' bill [S. 157] authorizing the purchase of stationery for the county
              officers of this State, or for the use of the common pleas, circuit, criminal, or
              superior courts of this State, was read the third time. [The stationery to be
              purchased only on the order of boards of commissioners and judges of courts, at the
              best possible terms.]</p>
            <p>Mr. Dwiggins asked, but failed to obtain, unanimous consent to amend the bill by
              saving contracts already made.</p>
            <p>Mr. Rhodes explained that county officers shall make out and swear to an itemized
              statement of the amount of stationery required, and after the purchase affidavit has
              to be made that it was bought on the best terms. The right of officers purchasing
              stationery now is much abused. In one county, in a bill of some $7,000, it is said
              that about $2,000 of that sum went into the pockets of the officers as commissions on
              the purchase. This stationery item is a large one in this State running up to from
              $125,000 to $175,000.</p>
            <p>Mr. Neff had in his mind a county officer who gets a regular commission of
              twenty-five per cent from a house in this city, and other officers get presents from
              stationers of whom they purchase supplies for the county. This bill will not hurt
              honest officers.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown regarded this bill as an insult to every county officer, and he opposed its
              passage.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved to recommit the bill with instructions to amend, by inserting a
              clause directing the publication of a condensed statement of the stationery purchased,
              once every quarter.</p>
            <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
            <p>Mr. Williams' bill [S. 13] requiring railroad companies organized under any law of

              within this State and along the line of the railroad, even though a railroad have been
              leased to an individual or foreign corporation, was read the third time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Steele thought this bill ought not to pass, objecting particularly to the clause
              requiring the principal office to be kept in this State.</p>
            <p>The bill failed to pass - yeas 19, nays 18.</p>

              Representatives in Congress to restore the names of certain soldiers who were
              discharged without leave after the rebellion surrender, to their original places on
              the rolls of the army.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kimball stated the emergency for the passage of this joint resolution. Toward the
              close of the war, in the spring of 1865, after the Lee and Johnson surrender, a number
              of soldiers were in camp at Nashville, anticipating discharge; and he mentioned many
              instances in which they took "French leave," as they called it, and went home. Under
              the army regulations all such were reported as absent without leave; and in many cases
              their commanders refused to restore them to the rolls. He did not so himself, but took
              the responsibility of restoring the names of all such soldiers under his command to
              the rolls and all their rights in the premises. The object here is simply to
              memorialize Congress for these just restorations.</p>

              no analogy in our criminal codeto remove objections to the principle that would compel
              a public officer to prosecute another for crime; and this section compels the trustee

                reading.</p>
              <p>Mr. Smith stated the object of the bill to be simply the repeal of that section 224
                which provides that the statute of limitation shall bar the officers of State and of
                the United States as other parties; and after further debate Mr. Edwards, of Vigo

                that section of the statute of limitations and whether it would not be expedient for
                the proper officers at once to prosecute all defaulting persons. Messrs. Edwards, of

              <p>Mr. Barrett asked leave to make an explanation of his vote; which the Speaker (Mr.
                Walker being in the chair) decided to be out of order, under the consistent rulings
                of the Speaker of the House; whereupon, Mr. Barrett submitted his appeal in writing:
                "The Speaker having decided that pending the call of the roll, when the name of a
                member is called, he can not explain his vote; from that we respectfully appeal to
                the judgment of the House."</p>
              <p rend="right">(Signed) BARRETT.</p>
              <p>Mr. Tully submitted a point of order, that an appeal requires two names; whereupon
                Mr. Heller also signed the appeal.</p>
              <p>Mr. Walker (Mr. Offutt in the chair) read the sixth rule under which the Speaker
                has uniformly decided that no explanation, remark, or debate can be had on the
                proposition before the House after the yeas and nays have been ordered and the first
                name has been called. He did not propose to defend his ruling, but simply to adhere
                to it, as the ruling of the Speaker of the House; but if we were to call 100 names
                here, and each member were allowed to explain his vote, it would be a practice that
                would stifle legislation.</p>
              <p>Mr. Lenfesty held that the language of rule six, can not be tortured so as to mean
                what the gentleman assumes; and it was not so construed in the other end of the
                capitol.</p>
              <p>Mr. Johnson hoped that the House would not be guilty of the folly of allowing
                members here to rise and explain their votes. This was a good and wholesome rule.
                The proper time to explain the vote was when the proposition is under discussion.
                The other course would be unjust to the House and an extravagant waste of time. He
                hoped the House would confirm the rulings of one of the ablest speakers that ever
                sat in that chair.</p>

              <p>Mr. Hollingsworth's bill [H. R. 312] to prescribe an official oath or affirmation,
                and prescribe a cause of removal of any man holding office in this State, was taken
                up on the third reading.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hollingsworth explained its object to be, that it shall be cause of removal
                from office for any man in office to use intoxicating liquors as beverages - a
                pretty good temperance bill - no politics involved - and suggested by the doctrine
                of civil service reform.</p>
              <p>Mr. Lenfesty proposed to recommit the bill to the Committee on Temperance, with
                instructions to strike out and insert "officers who get intoxicated."</p>
              <p>Mr. Branham proposed to add, "so as to apply only to persons who get intoxicated."
                and to strike out the emergency clause.</p>
              <p>Mr. Givan could not see how we can constitutionally remove a State officer but by

              <p>Mr. Johnson. That amendment is out of order. It does not propose to recommit. But I
                want to ask the gentleman from Tippecanoe this question: The Apostle Paul has
                written to a distinguished man that it would be well for his stomach to take a
                little wine; does this bill propose to repeal that?</p>

              <p>Mr. Hollingsworth If that comes under the head of beverage, I suppose it would.
                [Laughter.]</p>
              <p>Mr. Walker. Then the title of the bill ought to be amended.</p>
              <p>Mr. Smith submitted a motion - ineffectually - to lay the motion to recommit on the
                table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hollingsworth. If I understand the amendments, I will accept them.</p>
              <p>The motion to recommit, with instructions, was then agreed to.</p>

                taken up the third reading.</p>
              <p>Mr. Walker. The object is to supply what seems to be a defect in the appraisement
                laws. The provisions of the bill is that where there is failure to sell the facts
                shall be returned to the court by the sheriff, and the court, upon the hearing of
                the evidence, shall fix proper valuations and appraisements and order another

            <p>Mr. Rhodes explained that the bill was intended to throw guards around the purchase
              of stationery for counties, so there can be no fraud practiced.</p>
            <p>Mr. Howard thought the bill ought not to pass. It goes upon the presumption that
              boards of commissioners are more honest or incorruptible than county officers, which
              was not generally the case, probably. Both plans have been tried in his county, and
              the present system was preferred. He cited further objections to the bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. Neff insisted there was no reflection upon anybody in this bill; it simply
              provides guards for the county treasury.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gregg knew of some abuses in this direction, and regarded it the duty of the
              Legislature to provide restrictions when there is any chance for the commission of

              thought the bill a piece of nonsense. It would furnish relief to nobody.</p>
            <p>Mr. Rhodes suggested that Mr. Brown was laboring under a mistake. This bill casts no
              reflection upon any one. Its object is to break up secret arrangements between
              stationery men and county officers, by which the latter get from fifteen to
              twenty-five per cent. commission. It is our duty to prevent this species of
              rascality.</p>
            <p>Mr. Williams looked upon the bill as also intended to restrain county officers from
              extravagence.</p>
            <p>The bill passed the Senate by yeas, 27; nays, 14.</p>

              <p>Mr. Scott called up the special order, being the bill [H. R. 56] appropriating
                money, $15,000 annually to the State University and his bill [S. 155] amending the
                act erecting the State Normal School, the former bill being read the second
                time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Daggy moved to amend by striking out the preamble.</p>
              <p>Agreed to.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough moved to further amend section one by striking out the clause referring
                to the preamble and adding a clause repealing all acts inconsistent with this
                one.</p>
              <p>Mr. Smith moved to reduce the sum from $15,000 to $5,000.</p>
              <p>Mr. Cave moved to lay both amendments on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Sleeth demanded a division of the question.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott understood that the tuition fund is now but $8,000.Mr. Hough thought the
                Legislature was appropriating money to these schools that ought to go into the
                common school fund.</p>
              <p>The amendment to the amendment [Mr. Cave's] was laid on the table.</p>
              <p>The amendment [Mr. Huohs'] was also laid on the table, by yeas, 25; nays, 18.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott moved to reconsider the vote by which the preamble was struck out.</p>
              <p>Mr. Sleeth thought the fair way was to put all ihe appropriations together in one
                act, and he was opposed to restoring the preamble for an additional reason: this
                bill proposes $15,000, and there is $8,000 appropriated by a law in force now,
                making a total of $23,000 a year, which is too much.</p>
              <p>Mr. Harney noticed in the State Auditor's report that $12,000 was paid to the State
                University in 1872, besides $7,500 for salaries, and what other funds that
                institution has does not appear. He thought this amendment would absolve the
                Legislature from any further sums, under the constitutional provision.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner favored the passage of the bill as it came from the House without
                amendment.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott stated that this institution has a fund of $7,500 each year interest
                derived from the sales of land given by Congress. In 1867 there was an appropriation
                made of $8,000 annually. This State University was the pride of Indiana, and he
                regretted to see a disposition to cut down its tuition fund.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele regarded this as an institution erected for the education of all classes
                of the people of the State - free as far as tuition is concerned. Is it proper the
                State should foster such an institution? The Senate should not be parsimonious in
                this matter.</p>
              <p>Mr. Thompson was in favor of making the Normal School the capstone of the
                educational system of Indiana. He should vote for this bill to-day, but, if here at
                an ensuing session, before casting such another vote he must see a clear statement
                of its financial affairs.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown, as one reason which influenced his favorable vote, mentioned the fact
                that tuition in this institution is free. He desired to see the common school system
                made as perfect as possible, and then the children of this State stepping into the
                State University where they maybe prepared for the duties of life without cost for
                tuition.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams explained that at an early day the general government gave a township
                of land to the University at Vincennes. Some years after the Legislature proceeded
                to build a university at Bloomington, and sold the land, using the proceeds for that
                purpose. In 1843 the Legislature authorized the Vincennes University to sue for its
                recovery, and the suit resulted in a verdict of $70,000 for the Vincennes
                University. Congress then made a donation of a township of land to the Bloomington
                University. In 1855 the State stepped in and assumed the $70,000 due to the
                Vincennes University, issuing bonds therefor, the last of which were paid within the
                past year. Since 1867 there has been an annual appropriation made of $8,000 to this
                State University.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough thought we ought not to appropriate moneys which should go into the
                common school fund for the benefit of a fewthe rich men of the State. Sixty-two
                students of that 358 are residents of Bloomington; 96 are being taught medicine, and
                31 law, which leaves 164 others - an average of 1 8-10 for each county.</p>
              <p>When he concluded, the Senate took a recess till two o'clock.</p>

            <p>Mr. Wadge asked and obtained leave of absence for the <orgName>Committee on State
                Prisons</orgName> for to-morrow - yeas, 24; nays, 16.</p>
            <p>The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill [H. R. 56] pending at the time of
              taking the recess.</p>
            <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, hoped the motion to reinstate the preamble would prevail;
              and he replied to objections raised against the bill. The University was first
              organized in 1828, and the whole cost to the State up to this present time including a
              period of forty-four years, has been only some $60,000. The people of Bloomington
              appreciate the advantages they enjoy in having the University located there. When it
              burned down some years ago they put their hands in their pockets and paid about
              one-half of the cost of erecting the buildings which belong to the State. Many people
              from different parts of the Slate remove there with their families in order that they
              may educate their children at the University. The number of students is constantly
              augmenting, and it is for the Legislature to say whether the means of education in the
              State University shall be increased in proportion to the demand. It is said there are
              annually leaving this State, for the purpose of obtaining an education elsewhere, from
              1,000 to 1,200 of the young men of the State, and this would not be the case if you
              would make the State University as good a school as it should be. He combatted the
              idea that this is an institution for the sons of rich men only. It is for the poor and
              the rich - equally open to all classes, and three-fourths or more of those in
              attendance are probably the children of poor men. He hoped members would not be led
              away by the cry that this is a local institution, when, in fact, it is an institution
              for the people of the whole State.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hough believed it the duty of the State to educate every boy and girl in its
              limits, and while a warm advocate of our common school system, he was willing to
              increase the yearly appropriation to the Bloomington University from $8,000 to
              $15,000, which was an earnest of his friendliness to that institution, also.</p>
            <p>Mr. Collett demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the Senate.</p>
            <p>The motion to reinstate the preamble wan then agreed to, by yeas 30, nays 15.On
              motion by Mr. Brown, the motion to strike out the preamble was laid on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hough moved to amend the bill by reducing the sum from fifteen to ten thousand
              dollars.</p>

            <p>Mr. Williams moved to recommit the bill to the Committee on Education, with
              instructions to report a bill charging a tuition fee of not less than fifty dollars
              annually for each student.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Brown it was laid on the table by - yeas, 25; nays, 18.</p>
            <p>Mr. Scott moved to pass the bill to the third reading, and make it the special order
              for Tuesday at half-past ten o'clock, and upon that motion he demanded the previous
              question.</p>
            <p>The demand was seconded and the motion was agreed to.</p>
            <p>Mr. Scott's bill [S. 153] to amend the act creating the State Normal School, being
              the other part of this special order, was then read the second time. It appropriates
              $3,200 as a deficit, and $2,000 a year for running expenses, and creates what is to be
              known as the Normal School fund of $7,500 semi-annually.</p>
            <p>Mr. Scott explained that the amounts proposed to be appropriated were absolutely
              necessary, and that the moneys for the tuition fund came out of the common school
              fund, and not directly from the State treasury.</p>
            <p>The bill was ordered to be engrossed.</p>

                read the second time and ordered to be engrossed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregg's bill [S. 169] authorizing the organisation of voluntary associations
                and prescribing their powers and duties, was read the second time and ordered to be
                engrossed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott's bill [S. 187] to amend an act for the regulation of weights and
                measures - raising corn in the ear from sixty-eight to seventy pounds to the bushel
                - was read the second time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Carnahan said that sixty-eight pounds of dry merchanable corn on the cob will
                shell out fifty-six pounds to the bushel, and why merchants wish to take seventy
                pounds off the farmer he could not conceive, because it is not honest and it is not
                right.</p>
              <p>Mr. Wintherbotham thought it made but little difference whether sixty-eight or
                seventy pounds to a bushel is required. It is not a matter of much difference
                because the weight regulates the price. He preferred seventy pounds, in order that
                there may be a uniformity in this matter with adjoining States.</p>
              <p>Mr. Carnahan moved to amend the bill by substituting "sixty-eight" for "seventy"
                pounds to the bushel.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregg favored the amendment.</p>
              <p>Mr. Beeson, with his experience as a farmer, thought no Legislature could make the
                thing right. Where you can get one crop that will shell out fifty-six pounds for
                seventy pounds in the cob, you will get nine crops that will not; and no better rule
                can be established for a bushel of corn on the cob than to make it ninety
                pounds.</p>
              <p>Mr. Collett has also had experience in corn raising, and it is, that sixty-eight
                pounds is enough, and plenty. In his section it will overrun enough to pay for
                shelling.</p>
              <p>The amendment was agreed to by yeas, 25; nays, 11.</p>
              <p>The bill, as amended, was ordered to be engrossed.</p>

                school for the education and care of idiotic and feeble minded children, was read
                the second time. [It is described in these reports on the 15th of January, when it
                was introduced].</p>
              <p>On his motion - yeas 34, nays 2 - the constitutional restriction was dispensed

              the opinion of that officer that the title of W. P. and E. P. Gallup to lot 3, block
              No. 48, in the city cf Indianapolis, is good.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Branham the bill [S. 29] for the enlargement of the State House
              grounds, by vacating a certain street and alley therein named, and by the acquiring of
              certain real estate therein described, in order to secure a suitable site for a new
              State House, was taken up on the third reading.</p>
            <p>Mr. Branham. The importance of settling this matter now is, that these commissioners
              may acquire this property and quiet the title without going to the courts. The object
              is to acquire ground lying between here and Ohio street. The bill was drafted at the
              last session, and the commissioners required to report to that, or this, or the
              subsequent session, and they can do nothing without the action of the Legislature. If
              we pass this bill now, these commissioners will have to report to this session.</p>
            <p>The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives - yeas 77, nays 3.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mellett's bill [H. R. 87] to amend section 5 etc., of the common school law of
              March 6, 1865. [The council next May shall elect three school trustees and one
              annually thereafter, etc., to constitute a school board, etc., a revision of the the
              act; recognizing the county superintendents, etc., repealing, etc.,] was taken up on
              the third reading.</p>
            <p>Mr. Given. The object here is to correct the school law so as to make it correspond
              with the <pb n="165" xml:id="VAA8558-14-165"/> new assessment law, and remedy defects
              in the old law with few material changes. The school trustees of the cities are to
              hold their office for three years, so that one goes out and one comes in each year. As
              the law now stands, the city school trustees are all elected and all go out at the
              same time. It also changes the school year. As the law now is, the school year ends on
              the first of April. The bill proposes to change it to the first of June, (and as I
              think it should be. and probably will be if the House consent, changed to the first of
              July.) This is to make completeness in the school year, thereby giving the trustees
              time to settle before the beginning of the school business for the succeeding year.
              This bill also changes the time of taking the enumeration of the school children from
              August and September to the earlier dates from the first of March to the first of
              April, so that it makes the enumeration, come into the same school year, instead of
              extending into parts of two years. It also provides that the school trustees may levy
              a tax for school house purposes to the extent of fifty cents on $100. Other changes of
              the law proposed in the bill are not material. It provides for county superintendents,
              and makes it incumbent on the trustees to elect one of their number treasurer - to
              give bond, etc., because there is no provision of law for a school treasurer for
              incorporated cities. They do elect one, but the law is silent in the matter. The bill
              also provides that incorporated towns may establish graded schools - simply providing
              for what is now done in a great many towns and cities without law. It also provides
              that the school funds shall be loaned at eight per cent instead of seven. It also
              provides that the trustees, instead of settling with the County Commissioners in
              March, their office shall terminate in October, so that the Commissioners may receive
              their reports in such time as to make a deliberate transfer of the office from the
              outgoing to the incoming trustee - so obviating a present difficulty.</p>
            <p>Mr. Satterwhite concurred in the opinion that the school year should terminate on the
              first of July. This bill provides that the school trustees shall be elected on the
              first Monday in May. That is the time of the election of the town boards, and it makes
              a conjunction which ought to be avoided. I have consulted the friends of the bill and
              the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and it has been agreed upon that the town
              boards should elect the school trustees on the first Monday in July. I therefore
              submit and ask for unanimous consent of the House to the adoption of these amendments;
              in the first section strike out "first Monday in May," and insert "first Monday in
              July;" also strike out the words "second Monday in June," and insert "first Monday in
              July." The school men throughout the country agree that these amendments are really
              essential to the bill. The amendments were adopted by unanimous consent, and so the
              bill was finally passed the House of Representatives - yeas, 58; nays, 19.</p>

              <p>Mr. Branham, (by unanimous consent,) submitted from the Committee on Benevolent
                Institutions, a report in writing, setting forth the excellent healthy and orderly
                condition of said institutions, commending the officers in charge; and recommending
                a total appropriation for the Hospital for the Insane of $218,600; and for the year
                ending March 15, $133,000; and for repairs, $10,000. Furthermore, in view of the
                increased capacity of the Hospital for the Insane, by the commencement of the second
                year (which will necessarily increase its current expenses,) the committee ask an
                allowance of $30,000 to cover this contingency, making in the aggregate $163,000.
                For the Deaf and Dumb Institution, the sum of $65,000 for the year ending March,
                1874, and for the year ending March '75, $67,500. For the Blind Institution for
                1874, $32,500; and for the year 1875, $32,500. For the Soldiers' Home the allowance
                in blank: and the committee re- <pb n="166" xml:id="VAA8558-14-166"/> commend that
                this report be referred to the <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>, with
                instructions to insert these appropriations in the specific bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. B. said the committee do not report the sum to be appropriated for the
                Soldiers' Home because we have no report from that institution. I submit to the
                House whether it will consider this matter at once, and as a whole, or take it up by
                items.</p>
              <p>The Speaker. The question is on concurring in the report.</p>
              <p>Mr. Branham. We have recommended the amounts asked for by these several
                institutions. The amount reported for the Insane Hospital will give to that
                institution an increased capacity for no more patients. The committee think that
                these accommodations can be provided cheaper at that hospital than anywhere else;
                and the committee also think that it is entirely proper to make the proposed
                enlargements. But there are two items left out of the report which the committee
                intended for the institution for the education of the blind. The first is an
                appropriation of $1,000 to buy books for the blind, not only of that institution,
                but for the benefit of the destitute blind all over the State; and the other is
                demanded by the fact that the blind institution is not sufficient to accommodate all
                the pupils that are coming in; and the question is whether the House will agree to
                appropriate $65,000 to be appropriated for the fiscal year commencing on the first
                of April, 1874. I will move those amendments to the report, as follows:</p>
              <p>Add the following words:</p>
              <p>"That $1,000 be appropriated for the purchase of books for the blind, not only for
                the Blind Institute, but for the destitute blind throughout the State; and that
                $65,000 be appropriated for the purpose of making additions to the Institution for
                the education of the blind for the fiscal year ending March, 1875."</p>
              <p>The amendment was adopted, and then the report, as amended, was concurred in, and
                referred to the Committee on Ways and Means with the recommended instructions.</p>

                clerk, surveyor and assessor, and amending the title; and a minority report
                recommending the passage of the bill without amendment. The question being on
                adopting the report of the minority as an amendment to the majority report - </p>
              <p>Mr. Reno said the opposition to the amendment was, that it allows those officers to
                be appointed, whereas they should be elected by the people.</p>
              <p>Mr. Riggs stated that he was just from home, and could state directly that the
                provision in question was unanimously desired by the people as far as he was
                informed - there was a desire to be rid of an incompetent clerk.</p>
              <p>The report of the minority was rejected, and then the amendments reported by the

              <p>On motion of Mr. Riggs (a suspension of the constitutional restriction having been

              <p>This report was concurred in.</p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. Sleeth, the report was amended so that the bill shall lie on the

              <p>He also returned the bill [S. 250] to amend section 60 of the city incorporation
                law, with a recommendation that it pass.</p>
              <p>These reports were severally concurred in.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough, from the same Committee, returned Mr. Gregg's bill [S. 279] to regulate
                the stooping of passenger trains in incorporated cities, with recommendation that it
                lie on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregg explained that the bill simply provides that all passenger trains must
                stop at their regular places for taking on passengers in all incorporated cities. He
                moved that the report be so amended as to recommend the passage of the bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough sustained the conclusions of the committee not to interfere with the
                running of through or lightning trains, as they are called.</p>
              <p>Mr. Neff thought the bill does not go as far as it ought. He saw no reason for
                discrimination between cities and incorporated towns - especially ought trains to
                stop at all places where the mails are put on and off the trains.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregg was willing that the bill should be so amended. Our first duty is to
                accommodate our own people.</p>
              <p>Mr. Harney believed such a bill would effectually stop the running of fast trains.
                Citizens of Indiana frequently want to travel east and west, and if other States
                were to reduce all trains to accommodation time, no through lightning trains will be
                run.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele reminded the Senators that commerce demands that fast trains shall be
                run over railroads to carry through travel, and he thought this matter is as well
                regulated now as it can be. The committee acted wisely in its recommendation.</p>

              <p>He also returned Mr. Taylor's bill [S. 242] to amend sections 57 and 58 of the city
                incorporation law, with amendments to section 7.These reports were severally
                concurred in.</p>
              <p>He also returned Mr. Neff's bill [S. 267] requiring license for certain purposes,
                menageries, etc., with amendments striking out section 2, etc.</p>
              <p>Mr. Neff opposed striking out the section 2, proposing to license stock and
                exchange brokers, as it was intended to require a license of irregular dealers in
                promissory notes, etc., and not to affect regular banking houses.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins explained that the committee were of opinion that this section would
                apply to banks, and it was struck out at the suggestion of the author of the
                bill.</p>
              <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins returned the bill [S. 229] providing for the distribution of the

              <p>These reports were concurred in.</p>
              <p>Mr, Daggy, from a majority of the same committee, returned Mr. O'Brien's bill [S.
                229] to legalize acts of trustees of Cicero, Hamilton county.</p>
              <p>Mr. Boone, from the majority of the same committee, reported unfavorably upon this
                bill, because it is a curative statute, and special in its operations; and because
                the citizens of the town are divided on the question as shown by the petitions and
                remonstrances before the committee; and because it would be a precedent for the

                to the courts.</p>

              <p>He also returned Mr. Beardsley's bill [S. 33] to amend the charter of the Indiana
                Fire and Marine Insurance Company, with a recommendation that it lie on the
                table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele, from the same committee, returned Mr. Scott's bill [S. 286] with
                reference to liens on buildings, with a similar report.</p>
              <p>He also returned Mr. Carnahan's bill [S. 285] to repeal an act concerning weights
                and measures, with a recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed.</p>
              <p>He also returned Mr. Bird's bill [S. 312] to fix the salary of the Governor's
                Private Secretary, with a recommendation that the salary be reduced from $2,200 to

              <p>Mr. Gregg, from the same committee returned the bill [S. 314] to fix the number of
                jurors necessary to find a verdict in civil cases, with a recommendation that it be
                indefinitely postponed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gooding objected to this report as being acted upon in too great haste. It
                frequently happens that one or two stubborn jurors hang a jury and so necessitate
                another trial. There is much talk against the expense of litigation, and this bill
                provides that two-thirds of the twelve may find a verdict in civil cases, which
                would materially decrease the expense of litigation. In the passage of laws all that
                is required is a bare majority, and a law may be enacted over the veto of a Governor
                by a simple majority vote. This bill but proposes a principle that permeates through
                all our governmental system, and there is no good reason why it should not prevail
                in this respect.</p>
              <p>On his motion the report was amended so as that the bill shall lie on the
                table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregg, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned the bill [S.
                298] to amend section of the practice act, with a recommendation that it lie on the
                table as superseded matter.</p>
              <p>He also returned the bill [S. 313] to amend section 2 of the act in relation to the
                Attorney General, with a recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Miller, from the <orgName>Committee on Roads</orgName>, returned Mr. Collett's
                bill [S. 81] to authorize the election of a county engineer, with a recommendation
                that it lie on the table.</p>

                bill [S. 277] to extend the jurisdiction of criminal courts with a favorable
                report.</p>

                Mr. Beeson's bill [S. 244] fixing the salary of certain officers of benevolent
                institutions with amendments.</p>

                to section 2.</p>
              <p>Mr. Collett, from the <orgName>Committee on Agriculture</orgName>, returned Mr.
                Scott's bill [S. 274] to amend the act relating to the capital stock of agricultural
                societies, with amendments.</p>
              <p>Mr. Harney, from the same committee, returned Mr. Stroud's bill [S. 283]
                authorizing agricultural societies to issue capital stock and own real estate, with
                a recommendation that it lie on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown, from the Committee on Railroads, returned Mr. Cave's bill [S. 231] in
                relation to donations by individuals to railroads, with a favorable report.</p>
              <p>He also returned Mr. Beardsley's bill [S. 139] authorizing railroads to alter
                lines, with a similar report.</p>
              <p>Mr. Daggy, from the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>, returned the
                bill [H. R. 36] to amend the act to incorporate the Franklin Insurance Company, with
                a favorable report.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins, from the <orgName>Committee on Railroads</orgName>, returned the bill
                [H. R. 240] with amendments.</p>

            <p>Mr. Mellett, from the <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName>, returned Mr.
              Buskirk's bill [H. R. 480] to encourage teacher's institutes, with a recommendation
              that it lie on the table. He said the bill is for the purpose of increasing the fund
              for the expenses incurred in holding teachers institutes over the State. The amount
              allowed now to each county is $50. The bill proposes to make it $2 for every teacher
              in attendance. The committee think that the provisions of the bills that have been

            <p>Mr. M. also returned Mr. Butterworth's bill [H. R. 340] to compel parents and

            <p>Mr. Walker did not believe that the House (probably without a quorum) ought to
              receive reports from committees on bills involving important questions, and proceed to
              concur in them. I believe that this report ought to be laid on the table.</p>

                in notes and written agreements, as illegal, with the same recommendation.</p>
              <p>Mr. Harney said the bill is to meet a state of affairs recently grown up, which
                does great injury and which is founded upon a proposition that no man can go into
                court withoutan understanding that an attorney must be paid by the victim. It is
                simply usury, it is not founded upon equality, and can do no public good. It has
                grown up by custom and usage in contravention to law. You have the same right to say
                the maker of the note shall pay you five per cent in addition to the sum named. It
                is nothing but grinding usury.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown favored the passage of the bill being opposed to the principle that the
                borrower shall pay the expenses of the lender's litigation. It is a wrong and an
                injustice; and honest judges have invoked the Legislature to pass some such bill as
                this. He hoped the report of the Committee would not be concurred in.</p>
              <p>Mr. Orr also opposed concurrence in the Committees report and favored the passage
                of the bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. O'Brien. The bill belongs to a class of legislation that he is opposed to. The
                Committee are of opinion that it is not the business of the <pb n="174"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-14-174"/> Legislature to regulate contracts between men. Men will
                make foolish contracts, and they should fulfill their contracts; therefore, he hoped
                this bill and all bills of its class will fail to pass.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele, entered his protest against concurrence in this report. He thought it
                right to interpose obstacles to the making of improvident contracts. He
                characterized the Attorney fee clause as a decent way for stealing. This law should

            <p>The Lieutenant Governor understood that there has been no communication from the

            <p>On motion by Mr. Taylor, the bill was recommitted to the Special Committee.</p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. Steele, the Senate proceeded to consider bills from the House of
                Representatives on the third reading.</p>
              <p>The bill [H. B. 213] defining cruelty to animals, defining it as misdemeanor, and
                prescribing punishment therefor - fine in any sum not exceeding $100, was read the

              <p>The bill [H. R. 6] creating the Indiana Centennial Association, was read the third
                time with the amendments made by the Committee heretofore adopted by the Senate,
                reducing the sum appropriated to $1,000 annually.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Bunyan, and by unanimous consent, the bill was further amended by
                substituting the "26th of March" for the "23d of February."</p>
              <p>At the suggestion of the Lieutenant Governor, the bill was recommitted to the

              <p>Mr. Sleeth was satisfied that this bill in its present shape should not pass, as it
                will take away criminal jurisdiction of this character from mayors of cities.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregg thought the Senator from Rush [Mr. Sleeth] is mistaken, as mayors of
                cities have the same jurisdiction as justices of the peace. He insisted that such a
                bill should pass in order that this class of small misdemeanors may be taken out of
                the Circuit and Common Pleas Courts.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown, by reference to the report of the judiciary Committee, discovered that
                this bill was laid on the table by concurrence in the report.</p>

                1852in reference to changes of venue - was read the third time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Daggy moved to recommit the bill to the Judiciary Committee, with instructions
                to amend by adding these words: "Unless the same cause for change exists in the
                county to which such change was granted as existed in the county from which such
                change was taken."Mr. Brown opposed the motion to recommit, and moved to lay it on
                the table.</p>
              <p>The latter motion was rejected, by - yeas, 21; nays, 22.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown thought this amendment was intended to apply to some case or class of
                cases. Where is the end to changes of venue if this amendment be agreed to?</p>
              <p>Mr. Daggy desired to reach a large class of mining cases that are in the western
                part of the State. He regarded the amendment as right and proper, and would like the
                judgment of the committee on it.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins opposed the proposed amendment.</p>
              <p>Mr. O'Brien hoped this bill would not pass, in any shape. This amendment would
                allow a party to swear a prejudice and obtain a change of venue to any county in the
                State, and there is no discretion with the court in civil cases.</p>
              <p>Mr. Rhodes thought this provision would be used by railroads and other parties for
                the pur- <pb n="176" xml:id="VAA8558-14-176"/>pose of delay. He would not vote for a
                law that will give parties this chance for causing delay.</p>
              <p>Mr. Slater moved that the bill be indefinitely postponed.</p>
              <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas 29, nays 12.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved to reconsider the vote just taken.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown moved to lay this motion on the table.</p>
              <p>The latter motion was agreed to - yeas, 22; nays, 21.</p>
              <p>The bill [H. R. 137] to amend section 103 of the criminal practice act of June 17,
                1852, relating to the order of pleading, giving the State the right to open and
                close, was read the third time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele knew of no good reason for a change in the present practice giving the
                defendant the closing argument. A majority of the Judiciary Committee were opposed
                to the bill as it now stands. He moved to lay the bill on the table.</p>
              <p>The motion was rejected by yeas, 17; nays, 24.</p>
              <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence,moved to indefinitely postpone the bill. The State now
                generally has the close in the charge of the judge to the jury, and he was not
                willing to give her two closing arguments.</p>
              <p>Mr. O'Brien saw no reason why the State, being the plaintiff in every criminal
                prosecution, should not have the closing argument; because her case has to be made
                out beyond any reasonable possibility of doubt. The idea that a judge shall argue
                the case is a new one to him. Criminals go unpunished because of the crippled
                condition in which the State goes into court. He favored the passage of the bill and
                opposed indefinite postponement.</p>
              <p>Mr. Boone also opposed the indefinite postponement.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner spoke against the passage of the bill, and thought the pending motion
                should be agreed to.</p>
              <p>Mr. Harney and Mr. Brown favored the passage of the bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregg. Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, and Mr. Steele, argued for the pending
                motion, their remarks will appear in the Brevier Legislative Reports.Mr. Slater

            <p>Mr. Kimball's bill [H. R. 306] to regulate the recording of instruments and declaring
              the legal effect thereof, was considered on the third reading.</p>
            <p>Mr. Buskirk. In the first place, this bill proposes to overturn a principle of common
              law which has stood for hundreds of years - which has been the law of England for
              centuries, and has long been the law of nearly every State of the Union and of the
              State of Indiana. That principle is: that if a party has constructive notice of some
              other instrument of title to the real estate it has the same effect of actual notice.
              This bill provides that all unrecorded instruments shall be good only as to the
              parties in the interest, but void as to all others; and this does away with the law as
              to constructive notice. He understood also that the bill provides for printed records,
              under forms so divided into columns and so different from those now in use in our
              Recorders' offices, that it will require a new set of books for every office. While it
              might be a very good bill for those interested in printing, it seems to to me that it
              would put the counties to needless expense.</p>
            <p>Mr. Walker. If the gentleman from Gibson will look at the statute, he will find that
              this is an exact copy, in respect to the books, of the law as it now is, with this
              additional column headed "To whom delivered after being recorded." As to the "date of
              reception" and the "day" and "hour," the Recorder, if he chooses, can make those
              lines, or he can make the record without them. I believe the people of the State are
              ready for this change in our legislation for their own protection. It is not my bill;
              but I believe it will most effectually close the doors against frauds that are being
              perpetrated by fraudulent conveyancing. Under the law as it now stands, when a man
              purchases land, it is impossible for him to tell whether he has a good title or not
              till the end of ninety days; for if before the close of the ninety days, the prior
              grantee comes in and gets his instrument with the recorder, he is estopped. I believe
              that before the grantee leaves the Recorder's office, he ought to be able to know that
              he has a clear title to his property. There is where he goes to determine his title,
              and he ought to be able to ascertain it there, clearly and at once. And I think it
              does not affect the doctrine of constructive notice after the ninety days. Persons who
              hold outstanding unrecorded deeds ought not to divest the title of those who have put
              their deeds on record. How often is it the case that parties hold mortgages for years
              unrecorded. This bill simply requires that parties who receive mortgages or deeds
              shall put them at once upon the record; and then all will be well and clear as to the
              title. Now, on account of the existing intricacies, none but a lawyer can successfully
              examine and determine the title; but under this bill the party can trace his title
              from the record - with the single exception of the case of a mechanic's lien, the bill
              leaving the law in that respect just as it is. But in all such cases the grantee may
              generally know well enough about the fact of buildings being erected on the premises.
              Under this bill, if you are the buyer of a farm, you may know at once from the records
              whether you have the realty free from outstanding titles. This bill proposes also to
              requires the sheriff who makes sale of real estate in another county to cause the same
              to be recorded in the Recorder's office.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shirley thought this a good bill, excepting only section 2, and should vote
              against it unless it were amended. That section declares that every recorded deed
              shall have priority over every other, without regard to the date of the instrument.
              There was hardship there; as he gave example of the grantee living at a distance, and
              desiring to see his deed before it goes to record. He would be in favor of making the
              limitation thirty days for record.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Walker, the further consideration of the bill was postponed, and it
              was made the special order for to-morrow at two o'clock P. M.</p>

              operates injuriously to the credit of the State - especially to those who desire to
              borrow money of persons residing without the State.</p>

              wait two or three years for his collections, and urged its repeal.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cobb. It seemed to him that we have legislated enough in favor of wealth and
              against poverty - in favor of the strong and against the weak; and he thought that one
              of the wisest provisions of the laws which allows the man who has been so unfortunate
              as to have his farm sold on execution, one year to redeem it.</p>

              <head rend="center">LAWRENCEBURG INSURANCE COMPANY.</head>
              <p>Mr. Cauthorn asked and obtained unanimous consent for the consideration of the bill
                [S. 160] to amend the act of February 28, 1832, to incorporate the Lawrenceburg
                Insurance Company. (It proposes to change the style to the Citizens Insurance
                Company, to increase its capital stock to $100,000 and thence indefinitely.)</p>
              <p>Mr. Miller. If we want to pass a law that will place this insurance company
                entirely beyond the reach and control of the Legislature, I think we have now one of
                the best opportunities of doing so. Here is an old, defunct corporation, organized
                in 1832, one of the oldest in the States; yet, living not very far from Lawrenceburg
                myself, I know nothing about it. But I undertake to say here, that this bill is to
                revive a charter <pb n="179" xml:id="VAA8558-14-179"/>that gives extraordinary
                privileges to the corporators - such as can not be obtained under the general law -
                that it is now undertaken to galvanize this defunct institution into life again,
                because of extraordinary powers in the original charter. If this is not the purpose,
                why should the citizens of Evansville go up to Lawrenceburg and buy up these
                franchises? Why did they do this if they did not want to hedge themselves in the
                possession of peculiar advantages so that it will be impossible for future
                legislatures to reach them? And he insisted that a bill of this kind should not be
                supported here especially at a time when we are casting about us to get up a good
                insurance law, such as might be suggested by the sad experience in Illinois and
                Massachusetts.</p>
              <p>Mr. Wolflin considered that the gentleman took a wrong view. It was to favor the
                establishment of insurance companies in this State and so to keep capital in the
                State that the bill was introduced here.</p>
              <p>Mr. Cauthorn submitted the absurdity of the assumption that the bill was to
                galvanize into life a defunct institution. The institution is living, and the bill
                proposes to do just what the House has done with a bill introduced here by the
                gentleman from Marion, (Mr. Kimball,) which was to remove the Franklin Insurance
                Company from Franklin to this city, and to increase its capital stock and otherwise
                enlarge its franchises. He considered the endorsement of the Senate equivalent at
                least to that of a committee of the House of Representatives.</p>

                morning on the bill [H. R. 327] to regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors,
                etc.</p>
              <p>Mr. Sarnighausen declared that no Senator would go for a just temperance bill more
                cheerfully than he, and that all laws, measures and efforts to prevent intoxication
                will always receive his most hearty support, but this bill is not such a measure. In
                his opinion it would be better to find out the reasons why the present law is not
                enforced than to attempt to legislate as this bill proposes. This bill provides a
                fine of not less than five dollars where liquor is sold to an intoxicated person.
                While Mr. Sarnighausen would say let such an one be fined not only five dollars or
                fifty dollars, but five hundred dollars, and if possible five thousand dollars,
                because the seller has helped to make a man a dog and a hog. He pointed out numerous
                objections to the passage of this bill.</p>
              <p>The report of the committee now being read - </p>
              <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, moved to refer the bill, together with the report from,
                the Committee on Temperance, to the Judiciary Committee, not wishing it to be
                understood that he was opposing the bill by making this motion, for he is probably
                as much of a friend to the cause of temperance, and will go as far to secure the
                passage of a just law for the suppression of intemperance as any Senator upon the
                floor. He believed there are some features in this bill that will not stand the test
                of the courts, and if it is passed, instead of having a law for the suppression of
                intemperance, we will be left without any law upon that subject. The temperance
                people of the State of Indiana are asking this Legislature for a law that can and
                will be enforced by the courts. This bill has not been examined either by the
                  <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> of the House nor of the Senate. It is a
                very important bill, and should receive a very strict and most careful exam!nation
                at the hands of the best lawyers of this body; and if it is defective, whatever its
                defects are they ought to be corrected, so that when a temperance bill is passed it
                will be such an one as is demanded by the temperance people of the State of
                Indiana.</p>
              <p>Mr. Sleeth moved to amend the motion to refer by instructing the <orgName>Judiciary
                  Committee</orgName> to report back the bill day after to-morrow.</p>
              <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, accepted the amendment.</p>
              <p>Mr. Sleeth believed that this bill would not suffer in the hands of the
                  <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, for it is well known that a majority of
                that committee are friends of this bill, and every member of that committee are
                friendly to the cause of temperance. Just now, at the very time the courts of Ohio
                are striking down certain provisions of a law from which this bill is copied, a
                proper judgment would dictate a reference of this bill to the law committee of the
                Senate.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins contended that this bill could not be amended by the Judiciary
                Committee in any way to make it better.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown cautioned the friends of this bill to make haste very slowly. If it is
                one that can be sustained by the laws and constitution of his country, he should
                vote for it gladly, because some legislation should be had on the temperance
                question.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele was a friend to the bill and a friend to it as it stands. He did not
                know any good that could come to the bill nor did he apprehend it will acquire any
                additional force by being referred to the <orgName>Judiciary
                Committee</orgName>.</p>
              <p>Mr. Daggy also opposed the motion to refer.</p>
              <p>Mr. Boone was in favor of the proposed reference of the bill. The fact that it has
                been delayed to this late hour of the session is not the fault of its enemies, for
                it has been in the hands of its friends.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough regarded the motion to refer as uncalled for.</p>
              <p>The hour of twelve o'clock having arrived, an ineffectual motion was made for a
                recess till two o'clock.</p>
              <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, after inquiry as to whether any other Senator desired to
                speak, proceeded to close the debate (which will appear in the Brevier Legislative
                Reports) on this subject.</p>
              <p>Mr. Slater made an ineffectual demand for the previous question.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele again spoke in opposition to the motion pending.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Hall the motion to refer was laid on the table by - yeas, 26;

            <p>Mr. Fuller moved to amend by declaring that <pb n="182" xml:id="VAA8558-14-182"/> the
              provisions of this bill shall not apply to the sale of wine and beer.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown moved to include cider.</p>
            <p>Mr. Fuller accepted the amendment.</p>
            <p>On motion by Mr. Steele - yeas, 25; nays, 22 - the amendment wan laid on the
              table.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown moved to amend the sixth section by inserting; the word "knowingly" before
              the word "sell," and before the word "by," in the seventeenth section, so the seller
              may not "knowingly" sell to any minor or habitual drunkard.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hubbard thought the bill, just as well without it.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Hough, this amendment was laid on the table, by - yeas, 25; nays,
              21.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gregg moved, to strike out the emergency clause.</p>

              "dollars, to-wit: "Any person convicted of intoxication shall be required, upon the
              trial, to designate the person or persons from whom the liquor, in whole or in part,
              was obtained. In default of so designating such person, he or she shall, in addition
              to the line above mentioned, and as a part of his or her punishment for the offense,
              be imprisoned in the county jail not less than one day nor more than ten days, at the
              discretion of the court."</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown asked the Senator to include in his amendment a motion to strike out the
              eighteenth section. Mr. Boone did not acquiesce in the suggestion.</p>

              thereto.</p>
            <p>Mr. Steele was sure there was nothing in this objection to the bill. He moved to lay
              the amendment on the table.</p>
            <p>This motion was agreed to by yeas, 26; nays, 21.</p>

            <p>Mr. Peed's bill [H.R. 430] to amend sections 5 and 6 of the act of May 31, 1852, to
              authorize Boards of County Commissioners to declare water courses navigable, was
              considered in its order on the third reading. (It raises the amount of county
              appropriations to remove obstructions to $800, and increases the time of road work by
              the Supervisor from four to six days.) Mr. P. stated the provisions of the bill and
              its desirableness on the part of the people of his county. It was finally parsed the
              House of Representatives - yeas 68, nays 4.</p>

            <p>Mr. Whitworth's bill [H.R. 447] to amend section 1 of the act of May 11, 1867, in
              relation to the charge of highways, was considered in order on the third reading. (Any
              person, through whose lands any highway may be established, may (by petition) enclose
              the overflowed parts of such roads by swinging gates - to be kept in repair under
              penalty.) It was finally passed the House of Representatives - yeas 54, nays 28.</p>

            <p>Mr. Buskirk's bill [H. R. 362] to amend section three of the act of March 1, 1853, to
              provide for compensation for animals killed or injured by the locomotives of railroad
              companies, was taken up on the third reading. (The judgment for plaintiff to include a
              reasonable fee for the plaintiffs attorney.) Mr. B. explained the object and enforced
              the necessity for the passage of the bill, arguing the justice as well as the
              constitutionality of the principle involved.</p>

            <p>Mr. King could not understand how the attorney's fees could be included in the
              judgment, without contract.</p>

            <p>Mr. Givan submitted a constitutional objection; to which Mr. Buskirk replied. Then if
              it is constitutional it is eminently just.</p>

            <p>Mr. Gifford should vote against the bill in its present shape. It should discriminate
              so as to except cases where stock is pastured on the railroad.</p>

            <p>Mr. Cauthorn declared that it was a discrimination against railroads, that would
              apply as well in any case where a poor man is in law against the rich. It is class
              legislation.</p>

            <p>Mr. Butterworth should vote for the bill because of the reluctance of individuals to
              go to law with railroads. The effect of it would be salutary on the railroad
              companies. Make them kiss the rod that smites.</p>

            <p>Mr. Lenfesty was opposed to the bill - was opposed to legal provisions for attorneys'
              fees. He would not discriminate against railroads so necessary to progress, any more
              than against individuals. To enable parties to fix fees would tend to litigation.</p>

            <p>Mr. Gregory said the gentleman from Grant being a lawyer must have resolved himself
              in to a sort of an elemosinary institution against all of his own class. He argued the
              justice and expediency of the bill. This bill is only settling a mooted question as to
              the correct and proper measure of damages in cases of losses of this kind; and he was
              no way apprehensive of exorbitant rates of damages fixed by the people against
              soulless corporations.</p>

            <p>Mr. Thayer believed the bill is right and would result in the general good - which he
              maintained at some length. It would result in persuading the railroad companies to act
              in these cases precisely as an individual would act.</p>

            <p>Mr. Offutt should vote for the bill, because it would discourage litigation - it
              would induce railroad companies to deal fairly.</p>

            <p>Mr. Baker considered that the passage of the bill would be the occasion of prejudice
              against railroads, and jeopardize the security of passenger trains by the incontinent
              turning in of worthless stock on the railroad tracks in the night time.</p>

            <p>Mr. Woodard argued the justice of the bill, in <pb n="183" xml:id="VAA8558-14-183"/>
              view of his experience of the heartlessness of railroad companies, in general, of
              which he gave examples. Unless railroad companies were restrained by law it will not
              be a quarter of a century before there will be a revolution against their monopolies.
              These legal restraints must come. The people demand them.</p>

            <p>Mr. Crumpacker endorsed the words of Mr. Woodard, and answered objections to the
              bill.</p>

            <p>Mr. Shirley said there was such a thing as overdoing legislation. This bill will have
              the tendency to make people careless about their stock exposing them to the trains;
              and it would endanger the lives of passengers. He desired the passage of his own bill
              to cure this particular complaint against the railroads. I think these railroads
              should be fenced. Stock owners as well as the railroads should bear their own proper
              share of responsibility. He was free to confess that the railroads are exerting an
              influence and power in the country that is inordinate and ought to be repressed by the
              people rising up and speaking in their might.</p>

            <p>Mr. Anderson would not pass a law that would single out railroad defendants and
              discriminate against them as a class. There is yet no such legislation in our books.
              Unless the bill required all defendants to pay attorneys' fees, it was not worthy of
              the consideration of the House; and if it were proposed as a general law he could not
              say that it would make it better or more acceptable to him.</p>

            <p>The bill finally passed the House of Representatives - yeas, 63, nays, 16.</p>

            <p>Mr. Cauthorn submitted a preamble and concurrent resolution reciting that on the 20th
              day of January last, the House bill 350 to organize insurance companies, was
              introduced and ordered to be printed, and on the 28th of January was referred to the
              Committee on Insurance, where it has remained ever since, notwithstanding the
              resolution of the House requiring them to report it back; and therefore requiring said
              committee to return said bill with their report thereon instanter, and that the
              consideration of said bill be made the special order for Friday ten o'clock. After
              some conversation with Mr. Wilson, of Ripley, and a motion by Mr. Hardesty to lay the
              resolution on the table, at the suggestion of Mr. Branham there was obtained unanimous
              consent for the resolution to be withdrawn, and for the Committee on Insurance to
              report; whereupon Mr. Jones, from a majority of the Committee on Insurance, returned
              the Ways and Means Committee bill [H. R. 350] to organize insurance companies and
              regulate the business of insurance in Indiana, and Mr. Givan, on the part of the
              minority thereof, also submitted a report, neither of which was read, but the whole
              subject was made the special order for Friday. [It is understood that the majority
              report is the more adverse, cutting up and materially modifying the bill; while the
              minority report is favorable to the bill, amending it chiefly as to phraseology, and
              what is necessary to make it conformable to the Constitution and laws of the
              State.]</p>

            <p>Mr. Peed's bill [H. R. 446] to repeal section 55 of the act to regulate the business
              of general banking was considered in order on the third reading.</p>

            <p>Mr. Peed. This is to repeal that section of the old free banking law which provides
              for paying a salary of $1,500 to the Auditor of State and $800 to the Treasurer of
              Slate for conducting the business of said banks. The business of those free banks has
              been closed up for nearly twelve years. The object here is to cut off these salaries.
              No harm can result. It does not affect the original act in any manner, but to cut off
              these salaries, which at the time of the passage of the act wore reimbursed to tho
              State by the business of the banks.</p>

            <p>The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives - yeas 63, nays. 6.</p>

            <p>The bill [S. 198] to provide for the organization of an experimental school for the
              education of idiotic and feeble-minded children, was read and referred to the
                <orgName>Committee on Benevolent Institutions</orgName>.</p>

            <p>The Senate joint resolution for the cancellation, of certain bonds therein named
              (redeemed Garrett bonds, etc.,) was taken up and passed the House of Representatives -
              yeas, 72; nays, none.</p>

            <p>The Senate Normal School bill, No. 153, was read and referred to the
                <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName>.</p>

            <p>The Senate amendment to Mr. Johnson's bill [H. R. 137] to amend the criminal practice
              act so as to give the State the closing argument, was taken up, viz.: so as more
              stringently to require the judge's instructions to the jury to be in writing.</p>

            <p>Mr. Johnson. This bill comes back with amendments from the Senate, simply guarding
              the rights of the State more closely than the original bill. They do not change the
              substance of the bill, but only to amend so as to compel the State's counsel to open
              and close the argument. It provides that if the counsel for the State declines to open
              the argument, then the defendant's argument shall be the only one submitted, so as to
              compel the State's counsel to plead. I think this is a proper amendment. There is also
              another amendment by the Senate, providing that the court shall charge the jury in
              writing, when requested by counsel to do so. This also is a very proper practice,
              which, I think counsel should appreciate, because if the Court does not charge in
              writing, it will not go to the record, and there is no way of taking advantage of it
              upon error. I hope the House will concur in these amendments.</p>

            <p>Mr. Edwards, of Lawrence, hoped the House would not concur in these amendments till
              the Senate shall have passed the bill, which originally accompanied this, to-wit: the
              bill [H. R. 138] giving the right of the defendant to testify. The passage of the bill
              No. 138 induced the House to pass this bill which the Senate has amended.</p>

            <p>Mr. Johnson said that would be a most unparliamentary thing for the House to say to
              the Senate, we will hold your amendment as a cudgel over your head till you pass
              another bill: it would be a bad precedent, a most unheard of thing in legislation.</p>

            <p>Mr. Smith. I believe the gentleman from Lawrence (Mr. Edwards) is right. Many of us
              would not have voted for this bill but for the other bill alluded to. If either of
              these bills are right they are both right: so I say, I hope this bill will not pass
              here, unless they both become law. The gentleman from Marion placed his argument for
              this bill on the passage of that which permits defendants to testify in their own
              behalf.</p>

            <p>Mr. Buskirk was surprised to hear the gentleman from Marion make his point of order
              against the gentleman from Lawrence. He also said that it is necessary for one of
              these bills to counterbalance the other.</p>

            <p>But that for the defendent's testimony in his own behalf has been, indefinitely
              postponed in the Senate.</p>

            <p>Mr. Cowgill also hoped the Senate amendments would be laid on the table. He also
              argued the compatibility of the two bills, which were originally but one bill when
              introduced by the gentleman from Marion (Mr. Johnson.)</p>

            <p>Mr. Tulley demanded the yeas and nays on Mr. Edwards of Lawrence's motion to lay the
              subject on the table; and it was thereupon withdrawn.</p>

            <p>Mr. Johnson would venture to say that none but criminal lawyers were against this
              bill requiring the State to make the closing argument. It was a most wholesome law. </p>

            <p>Mr. Tulley most heartily concurred with the view of Mr. Johnson. Not another State in
              the Union has adopted the Indiana practice against the State's right to the close. The
              opposition to <pb n="184" xml:id="VAA8558-14-184"/> the bill was inspired by the
              criminal lawyers.</p>

            <p>The amendments of the Senate were concurred in - yeas 56, nays 21.</p>
            <p>The Senate amendments to Mr. Shirley's bill [H. R. 188] to amend section 433 of the
              practice act were taken up, viz: strike out and insert to this effect: When an
              execution against the property of any defendant is issued to the sheriff, if property
              be found, he shall make service and sell within sixty days, unless otherwise directed
              by the plaintiff or plaintiffs, or their agent (which Mr. S. said were perfectly
              satisfactory), and they were concurred in without a division.</p>

            <p>The Speaker laid before the House a communication from the Secretary of State,
              transmitting the memorial of the National Board of Trade on the subject of Emigration,
              etc., which was referred to the <orgName>Committee on Federal Relations</orgName>. </p>

            <p>Mr. Lenfesty submitted a preamble and concurrent resolution, reciting the
              disappearance of William C. Morgan, a citizen of Grant county, in the month of June,
              1865, under circumstances which have been so traced and developed since as to discover
              that he was murdered by one James L. McCollough - that Jos. Morgan, the father of the
              murdered Wm. Morgan, having prosecuted McCollough and convicted him of grand larceny,
              for which he was sent six years to the Illinois State Prison, has now procured
              McCollough's arrest for murder, who awaits his trial at the March term in Oxford,
              Benton County; and therefore proposing an appropriation of $400 to be applied, at the
              discretion of the Governor, towards the procurement of witnesses for the State against
              the said McCollough.</p>

            <p>After some conversation across the House, the concurrent resolution was adopted, and
              subsequently the vote was reconsidered upon the ground that it is out of order and
              incompetent for the House to appropriate money in this way.</p>

              reading. Mr. H. explained its object and necessity, to enable the authorities of that

              <head rend="center">RECORDS - LEGAL EFFECT.</head>
              <p>The Speaker returned to the special order, viz.: The consideration of Mr. Kimball's
                bill [H. R. 306] to regulate the recording of instruments ami declaring the legal
                effect thereof, the question being on the final reading.</p>
              <p>Mr. Givan considered that this bill would open the door of fraud in conveyances
                wider than at present. He opposed the printed records provision. It would involve a
                new set of books. It would also necessitate two sets of records for the same kind of
                instruments - as for short form and other deeds. He saw another objection in the
                first part of section five providing for a cross-entry. He exhibited a form which
                showed how expensive would be the indexing under this bill. With respect to tracing
                title, the terms of the act offered no relief, as he showed, where a commissioner is
                the grantor. The bill would impose unnecessary labor on the Recorder, without
                accomplishing any beneficial results.</p>
              <p>Mr. Henderson proposed and obtained unanimous consent to strike out the words in
                the third section: "or in print;" so that we shall have written, not printed
                records.</p>
              <p>Mr. Lenfesty took exception to the bill as to the effect it would have where the
                grantor gives a first and second mortgage, and the second mortgage goes to record
                first.</p>
              <p>Mr. Smith said the bill was to require promptitude, and he replied to the objection
                of Mr. Lenfesty. The bill at least reduces the ninety days that are now open to the
                making of fraudulent conveyances to but a very few days. He admitted that the bill
                will impose some additional labor on the Recorder, but it will more than
                correspondingly benefit everybody else. - </p>
              <p>Then we are in great need of money for business in all parts of the State, and
                capitalists will not loan to us whilst the delays about collections remain.</p>
              <p>Mr. Givan asked but did not obtain unanimous consent to insert appropriately these
                words: "executed and not recorded."</p>
              <p>Mr. Buskirk took special exception to the 7th section which wipes out the 90 days
                which the grantee has to put his deed on record. He showed that the security about
                title would not be bettered by this provision, and that the proper method of
                amendment would be to shorten this term of ninety days instead of wiping it out
                entirely.</p>
              <p>Mr. Baxter spoke in favor of the bill and showed how its provisions operate
                satisfactorily in about all the States eastward, of which he has personal knowledge.
                If we would propitiate the moneyed interests and business interests of the State let
                us pass this bill.</p>
              <p>Mr Kimball said under the present law there are many persons that really have no
                recorded title to land they really own. The passage of this act would compel men to
                exercise more care in this respect; especially would this be the case on the part of
                those who own land and desire to borrow money. Then, as might be shown from the very
                paper which was exhibited by the gentleman from Dearborn, every man by going to the
                Recorder's office would be able to trace his title for himself.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brett argued that grantees are entitled to a reasonable length of time to put
                their instruments to record. He saw not the frauds, nor the occasions for the same,
                nor the demand for loaning money, of which gentlemen speak.</p>
              <p>Mr. Offutt also opposed the bill. He would much prefer to shorten the time which
                the grantee has to record his instruments. And there was little in the argument that
                it would facilitate the tracing of title, he said there were other records to be
                consulted outiide of the Recorder's office to determine the title to real
                estate.</p>
              <p>Mr. Henderson stated his personal knowledge of frauds by the second conveyance of
                land, which the operation of this bill would prevent.</p>
              <p>The bill was rejected - yeas 30, nays 50.</p>

              <p>Mr. Givan introdnced a bill [H. R. 521] to provide for the erection of a new
                building for the use of the Indiana University at Bloomington, and making an
                appropriation therefor. (It proposes to appropriate $30,000 for a building of the
                University for the display of the Owen geological cabinet.) It was referred to the
                  <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Lenfesty, his Joseph Morgan concurrent resolution, submitted this

              <p>Mr. Branham, from a majority of the <orgName>Committee on Railroads</orgName>,

                enable railroads to alter their lines in certain cases, recommending its
                passage.</p>
              <p>Mr. Isenhour, from the minority of said committee, recommended its indefinite
                postponement; which report, after debate by Messrs. Branham and Givan, was concurred
                in, and substituted for that of the majority. So the bill was indefinitely
                postponed. Adjourned.</p>

            <p> The Lieutenant Governor directed the reading of the minutes. On motion it was
              dispensed with, and he announced the special order for yesterday afternoon, being the
                <orgName>Select Committee</orgName>'s bill [S. 238] to divide the State into
              circuits for Judicial purposes, to abolish the Courts of Common Pleas, etc.</p>
            <div type="section">
              <head rend="center">THE ASSESSMENT LAWS.</head>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Williams, Mr. Sarnighausen's bill [S. 294] to amend sections 1,
                15, 19 and 257 of the assessment of property act of December 31, 1872, was read the
                second time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Slater moved to amend by adding a section requiring semi-annual reports of
                premium receipts from foreign insurance companies to State officers, and affixing a
                tax of three per cent. thereon, less losses actually paid in the State. It was
                agreed to.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved for an additional section, amending section 195 by allowing
                printers sixty cents per description for the publication of delinquents.</p>
              <p>Mr. Neff was satisfied that sixty cents would be too large, because three or four
                columns of figures are cut off from the former mode of describing the property.</p>
              <p>Mr. Smith moved to amend the amendment by inserting fifty cents.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins explained that printers in country offices have to keep several
                hundred dollars worth of material the year round that is used only for the purpose
                of publishing the delinquent list. Then this fee comes from the delinquent, and not
                from the county or State. He accepted Mr. Smith's amendment.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner favored the amendment, believing it would be no more than fair.</p>
              <p>Mr. Slater said fifty cents a description is not as much in proportion as store
                keepers and business men pay for local notices.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele believed the thirty cents now fixed by law sufficient, but he moved to
                amend the amendment by making it thirty-five cents.</p>
              <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, believed our county newspapers are doing much to educate
                public sentiment in the proper channels, and in giving them a liberal compensation
                for the work they do.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Slater, the amendment was laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele moved to amend the amendment by inserting a proviso, that the
                publication of the delinquent list of each county shall be let to the lowest
                responsible bidder at a price not to exceed fifty cents per description.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Slater, it was not laid on the table by yeas 19, nays 27.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown would rather vote for the amendment without the word "responsible" in it,
                because a great many writs of injunction arise from this qualification.</p>
              <p>The amendment of Mr. Steele was agreed to by yeas 26, nays 23.</p>
              <p>Mr. Beeson moved to suspend the order of business that the new temperance bill [H.
                R. 327] may be taken up now.</p>

              <p>Mr. Brown said that was the first last, and only question before the Senate.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hubbard made the point of order that it takes a majority of the Senate to order
                a division of the question.</p>
              <p>The presiding officer sustained the point of order on the ground that a demand for

              <p>Mr. Brown appealed from this decision of the chair.</p>
              <p>The motion to recommit the bill was rejected by yeas 24, nays 25.Mr. Dwiggins moved

              <p>Mr. Brown now rose to a privileged question, and sent up his appeal from the

              <p>The Presiding Officer. The appeal will be attended to at the proper time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown asked the Chair to decide whether the sending up an appeal is not a
                privileged question.</p>
              <p>The Presiding Officer. I belive not.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown desired to know what condition the appeal is in.</p>
              <p>The Presiding Officer said the Chair demanded that it should be sent up in writing,
                but it was not sent up till now.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown. It is up now.</p>
              <p>The Presiding Officer. It is too late now.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown was proceeding to reply, but the gavel of the Presiding Officer
                restrained him. He desired to make another point of order but was admonished by the
                chair to take his seat.</p>
              <p>A motion was made to adjourn, out the Presiding Officer decided it out of order,
                because there was a motion pending for the previous question.</p>
              <p>The demand for the previous question was seconded by the Senate.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown inquired to what extent the previous question goes.</p>

            <p>Mr. Brown rose to the point of order that his appeal from the decision of the chair

            <p>The Lieutenant Governor directed the reading of the appeal, to-wit.</p>
            <p>The question being to commit House bill No. 237 with the instructions offered by the
              Senator from Boone to the Committee on Temperance, the Senator from Jackson, before
              the demand for the previous question was seconded, demanded a division of the
              question. The Senator from St. Joseph raised the point of order that the Senator from
              Jackson had no right to make such demand, which point of order was sustained by the
              President of the Senate [Mr. Chapman in the chair], and from which decision we, the

            <p>Mr. Chapman replied that the time was passed for the consideration of the appeal,
              that there is no power to get it in after business was done.</p>
            <p>The Lieutenant Governor held that the rules of the Senate as well as parliamentary
              law allows a reasonable time for the Senator to prepare his appeal. He cannot be
              limited as to time. He must have the time necessary to prepare his appeal. According
              to the statement of Senators, upon which we must rely, the appeal in this case was
              prepared with at least reasonable dispatch. The chair decided that the appeal may be

              <p>Mr. Gooding called up the special order, the bill [S. 238] redistricting the State
                for judicial purposes, abolishing the Courts of Common Pleas, etc, the question
                being on concurring in the report of the committee, substituting new matter for the

              <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
              <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, moved to dispense with the constitutional restriction
                that the bill may be read by title only for the second reading.</p>
              <p>This motion was agreed to by yeas 35, nays 5, and the bill was read by title only

              <p>Mr. Cave desired his dsstrict to remain just as it is, and he moved to lay the
                amendment on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gooding knew some of the Representatives from those counties were opposed to
                the amendment. Unless a redistricting bill is passed, the salaries of judges will
                not be raised in all probability. A great deal depends on the passage of this bill,
                and in order that it may pass, all the strength possible should be obtained for
                it.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams thought the Representatives were about equally divided in opinion
                about the change proposed in his amendment, and was willing now to let the Senate
                decide, and for that purpose demanded the yeas and nays.</p>
              <p>Mr. Cave moved to lay the amendment on the table.</p>
              <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas 22, nays 21.</p>
              <p>Mr. Smith moved to amend section thirty-four by striking out "Marshall and
                Kosciusko" and inserting in lieu ''Miami," and substituting, in section seventy
                ''Miami" for "Marshall and Kosciusko;" and he also submitted memorials from the bar
                of Fulton and Miami counties asking that the counties of Fulton and Miami shall
                constitute a judicial district and another amendment adding a new section to the
                bill making a District of the counties of Marshall and Kosciusko.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hubbard opposed this amendment because it leaves Howard county off by itself
                unprovided for.</p>
              <p>Mr. Smith moved to refer the bill with amendments to the <orgName>Committee on the
                  Judiciary</orgName>.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gooding and Mr. Glessner opposed the motion to refer.</p>
              <p>Mr. Winterbotham knew there was considerable opposition to this bill in his
                district among members of the bar, a number of whom would be here this evening
                desiring to be heard before some committee.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Fuller, the motion to refer was amended by changing its reference
                to a committee of the whole Senate, and making it a special order for ten o'clock
                to-morrow morning.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele moved ineffectually to change the time to Tuesday next at ten
                o'clock.</p>
              <p>The amendment as amended was rejected.</p>
              <p>Pending the amendment to the bill submitted by Mr. Smith - </p>

                penalties; and the same, with the pending amendments, were severally read by the
                clerk.</p>
              <p>Mr. Branham moved, ineffectually, for the consideration of the amendments to the
                bill S. No. 115.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Peed the bill [S. 6] was taken up first.</p>
              <p>Mr. Offutt moved to amend section 9 by inserting in the tenth line these words: "or
                any of its agents," and striking out lines seventeen to twenty-two - that is the
                individual penalty of $5 a day for neglecting to use cars furnished.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hollingsworth considered that this 9th section makes an unreasonable
                requirement of the railroad, and after the reply, and some conversation across the
                House, Mr. Offutt's first amendment was adopted.</p>
              <p>Mr. Cobb proposed as a substitute for Mr. Offutt's second amendment, to strike out
                ''five" and insert "three," in lieu; and strike out the words: "in the sum of $10 a
                day." He thought $3 a day was enough for an idle car; and in the other case he
                thought the penalty might be left to trial of the case, and then all the amendments
                were laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Shirley proposed to amend the first section in three several lines by inserting
                the words "within, the State," so as to confine the average charge for the distance
                of carriage to the length of the company's line within this State, which was
                rejected.</p>
              <p>Mr. Miller proposed to amend section four by inserting after the word "provided,"
                in the second line, these words: "assignee or receiver,"which was adopted:</p>
              <p>Mr. Troutman proposed to insert the words "per mile" in several places in the first
                section, which was rejected.</p>
              <p>Mr. Miller proposed to amend the bill by striking out and inserting sections three
                to five of the Senate bill No. 115.</p>
              <p>The Speaker called the gentleman's attention to Rule 64the chair can not entertain
                the motion because the Senate bill No. 115 is before the House.</p>
              <p>Mr. Branham could not so understand the rule 64, and, more for the purpose of
                making a speech than for testing the soundness of the ruling, he moved to amend the
                pending bill No. 6 by striking out all after the enacting clause and inserting the
                matter of the bill, S. No. 115. His speech which followed supporting the bill No.
                115, and deprecating the provisions of the bill S. No. 6, as tending inevitably to
                bankrupt the weaker and newer railroad companies, and to repress the construction of
                new lines, and thereby postpone and repress also the highest prosperity of the
                State, which lies in the development of her mines of iron and coal, shall it not be
                found with the rest of this debate in the appendix to volume 14 of the Brevier
                Reports? When he had concluded.</p>
              <p>The Speaker. The motion of the gentleman to strike out and insert the pending bill
                cannot be entertained.</p>
              <p>Mr. Branham. Then I move to lay the bill before the House - the Senate bill No.
                6,on the table, for the purpose of taking up Senate bill No. 115.The motion was
                agreed to - yeas 51, nays 21.</p>
              <p>Mr. Woodard submitted a motion to reconsider the vote just taken, and thereupon</p>
              <p>Mr. Offutt continued the debate supporting the provisions of the bill, S. No. 6,
                and delaring that the bill, S. No. 115, would be absolutely worthless as a
                substitute for the protection of the interests of the State.</p>
              <pb n="192" xml:id="VAA8558-14-192"/>
              <p>Mr. Walker followed, taking similar views, and replying to Mr. Branham.</p>
              <p>Mr. Cowgill opposed the motion, to reconsider and preferred the passage of the
                Senate bill No. 115. Mr. Thayer took the floor, but gave way for a motion to
                adjourn.</p>
              <p>Mr. Eward obtained leave of absence till Monday, and thenThe House adjourned.</p>

            <p>Mr. Hall offered a resolution declaring that all resolutions and action taken in

                bridges across the Ohio river, was read the third time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregg spoke of the importance of the navigation of the Ohio river and cautioned
                members against hastily passing a bill that may impede navigation on any of the
                larger streams.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gooding believed there are sixty-odd steamboats enrolled in his town of
                Evansville, and his constituents were asking for the passage of this bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele offered this bill at the request of Gov. Baker, thought it a good bill,
                and that it is now too late a day to object to bridging great streams because such
                bridges may obstruct navigation.</p>
              <p>Mr. Harney understood that bridges can be thrown across the Ohio river without the

              <head rend="center">RAILROADS.</head>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins, from the Committee on Railroads, returned Mr. Boone's bill [S. 317]
                to amend an act enabling railroads to alter their lines in certain cases, with a
                favorable report, which was concurred in by the Senate.</p>
              <p>He also returned Mr. Collett's bill [S. 281] authorizing railroad companies to
                abandon any part of their road, refund donations, etc., with a similar report.</p>
              <pb n="194" xml:id="VAA8558-14-194"/>
              <p>Mr. Gregg hoped the report would not be concurred in for various reasons. To allow
                railroads to run away from points designated in their charters is a thing that
                should not be countenanced. It would be surrendering to these corporations valuable
                rights belonging to the people.</p>
              <p>Mr. Daugherty also resisted concurrence in the report, by the Committee. This bill
                would materially injure his constituents.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele regarded this as a remarkable bill, the like of which he had never seen
                before in this body. It would be monstrous to allow any corporation such privileges
                as are embodied in this bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. Collett insisted that after corporations have done their part they should
                receive what aid counties through which pass have promised them. Justice should be
                demanded for one party as well as the other. Legislation in this State has destroyed
                to a great extent the value of many railroads running in and through it. This bill
                has a particular reference to a short railroad and to one man, who has put all his
                wealth in it, relying upon promised aid, which the Supreme Court, upon a little
                contemptible technicality, has ruled can not be enforced. This man now proposes to
                take up the track and pay all damage that may be done thereby to anybody.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hubbard thought the bill might affect other railroads than the one referred to,
                and it might work hardships in a different way.</p>
              <p>Mr. Collett assured the members this bill provided for repayment by the company to
                everybody damaged, and returns every gift and aid heretofore rendered.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele moved to lay the report and bill on the table.</p>
              <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas 25, nays 16.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins froin the <orgName>Committee on Railroads</orgName>, returned Mr.
                Scott's bill [S. 215] providing for the leasing of railroads, and authorizing one
                railroad to lease another railroad, with amendments.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown from the same committee returned his bill [S. 210] to extend the time for
                the completion of certain railroads, with a favorable report.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Scott, the consideration of House bills on the first reading was
                made the order to follow the consideration of the bill [S. 238] for redistricting

                recommendation that it lie on the table.</p>
              <p>He also returned Mr. Bird's bill [S. 312] to fix the salary of the Governor's
                Private Secretary at $2,200, with a favorable report.</p>
              <p>The reports were concurred in.</p>
              <p>He also returned the joint resolution [S. 11] requesting Indiana Congressmen to use

            <p>Mr. Gooding demanded a call of the Senate, which being taken discovered forty
              Senators as being present and answering to their names</p>
            <p>Mr. Hubbard called up the special order, being the bill [S. 238] for the

            <p>Mr. Dittemore moved to postpone this special order till Wednesday at two o'clock P.

            <p>Mr. Rosebrugh could not see what more light can be obtained on Wednesday next than we
              have now. So long as we don't abrogate the Common Pleas Courts we can not do much
              toward relieving the wants of the people. Though this alone may not entirely do away
              with the evil, it breaks a cordon so that subsequent Legislatures may be free to act
              in a manner that will satisfy the people. If the bill is postponed, in view of the
              fact that it has yet to pass the House of Representatives, we might as well say that
              we will talk about it and do nothing else. He had come to the Senate Chamber more to
              aid in the passage of this than any other bill, and if the Senate never begins to work
              upon it, nothing in that direction will ever be accomplished. He hoped the bill would
              not be killed by indirection but that a square vote will be had upon it.</p>

              put upon its passage; and upon that motion he demanded the previous question.</p>
            <p>The Senate seconded the demand for the previous question.</p>
            <p>The presiding officer (Mr. Brown in the chair) was not certain the yeas and nays can

            <pb n="195" xml:id="VAA8558-14-195"/>
            <p>The presiding officer stated the question to be on Mr. Smith's amendment, pending at

              counties of Marshall and Kosciusko, and to amend sections 34 and 70 by striking out

            <p>The Speaker returned to the unfinished business of yesterday, viz: the consideration
              of Mr. Woodard's motion to reconsider the vote of yesterday by which the bill [S. 6]
              "concerning the transportation of freight and passengers over railroads within this
              State, repealing, prescribing penalties, and declaring an emergency," was laid on the
              table, which bill was laid on the table with notice of a motion, to take up and
              perfect the bill [S. 115] to prevent extortionate charges for, and unjust
              discriminations in, the transportation of freight by railroad companies or other
              common carriers, and to provide a remedy when such extortions or discriminations are
              practiced.</p>
            <p>The debate embracing the comparative merits of these bills and the general subject of
              railroad legislation, was continued by Messrs. Wilson, of Ripley, Mellett, Woodard,
              Buskirk, Thayer, Branham, Walker, King and others.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Walker (and by unanimous consent) the vote by which the Senate bill
              No. 6 was laid on the table, was treated as reconsidered, and these several railroad
              bills were referred to the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>, and it was
              understood that the Committee on Railroads should sit with them, and that their report
              thereon should be made next Wednesday.</p>

          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">THE M'COLLOUGH CASE.</head>
            <p>Mr. Kimball, from the <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>, returned Mr.
              Lenfesty's concurrent resolution for an appropriation to enable Joseph Morgan, of
              Grant county, to pursue James McCollough, charged with the murder of Wm. C. Morgan,
              and awaiting his trial in the Benton circuit court, with material evidence in the
              case, and the committee propose amendments thereto by way of substitute, making it a
              joint resolution, requesting the Governor, if in his judgment he shall deem it proper
              to do so, to use of his contingent fund a sum of money not exceeding $400, to procure
              testimony in the case of the State against James Collough, charged with the murder of
              Wm. C. Morgan, in the Benton circuit court.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cauthorn hoped the House would not concur in this report, and would not adopt any
              resolution giving a dollar out of the treasury for any such purpose. If any citizen of
              the State has expended time and money to find out and expose a case of murder, he has
              done no more than his duty; and it is unjust to attempt a remuneration in this way.
              Such special legislation should not be tolerated here.</p>
            <p>Mr. Branham. Has not the Governor been in the habit of so using his contingent
              fund?</p>
            <p>Mr. Cauthorn. He has. But let the Governor exercise his own sound discretion without
              advice or request from the General Assembly. If it were determined by the House that
              this appropriation of money is right, then let the House pass a resolution requiring
              him, to do this thing. But we are not advised of the facts.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kimball. For the information of the gentleman from Knox, I would inform the House
              that this reported substitute was written by the Governor himself. It is the result of
              his reflections upon it, after having the matter in his hands for forty-eight
              hours.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lenfesty claimed that there has never occurred such a case in the State, where a
              father, without means, has pursued the murderer of his son for eight years. He was
              pleased with modification of the joint resolution reported by the committee - placing
              the whole thing in the discretion of the Governor.</p>
            <p>The Speaker stated that the joint resolution reported has no title, and directed the
              preparation of a title. It was written promptly by Mr. Lenfesty: "A joint resolution
              authorizing the Governor to pay out of the contingent fund certain money therein
              named."</p>
            <p>The joint resolution was then passed on the part of the House of Representatives -
              yeas, 84; nays, 3.</p>
            <p>Leaves of absence being asked for Messrs. Isenhower, Glasgow, Spellman, Barrett.
              Wolfiin, Rumsey, and the <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>, the Speaker
              suggested that this course would result in leaving the House without a quorum, and the
              pending business will require the most rigid economy of time if it is to be properly
              closed up during the session. Leaves of absence should be granted only in cases of
              sickness.</p>

            <head rend="center"> INSURANCE</head>
            <p>The Speaker announced the other branch of the special order for to-day, to-wit: the
              consideration of the <orgName>Ways and Means Committee's</orgName> bill [H. R. 350] to
              organize insurance companies, etc.</p>
            <p>Mr. Smith moved to make it the special order for two o'clock to-day.</p>
            <p>Mr. Walker proposed to amend and make it the special order for Tuesday.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cauthorn resisted the amendment as a motion for delay.</p>
            <p>Mr. Walker. It is not for delay simply, but for opportunity to consider the bill. He
              supposed he was not singular when he informed the House that he had never yet read
              that insurance bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kimball stated the origin of this bill, with the <orgName>Committee of Ways and
                Means</orgName>, and the urgency for its considerationit having been specially
              called for by resolution and set down as a special order for this day. It was due to
              the State that a matter so important as this should be fully considered.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Baker, Mr. Walker's motion was laid on the table affirmative 43,
              negative, 37and the question recurred upon the adoption of the motion of Mr.
              Smith.</p>
            <pb n="196" xml:id="VAA8558-14-196"/>
            <p>Mr. Offutt moved, ineffectually, to lay it on the table - yeas 13, nays 70.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ogden submitted an ineffectual motion to make the bill the special order for
              Monday two o'clock, and then Mr. Smith's motion was agreed to, and the bill was made
              the special order for two o'clock. P. M. Whence the recess.</p>

          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
            <p> The Speaker announced the consideration of the special order, viz: the committee
              bill [H. R. 350] to organize insurance companies and to regulate the business of
              insurance in the State of Indiana; and, there being a majority and minority report
              thereon, they were read by the Clerk. The majority report is voluminous as to its
              proposed amendments, placing the business of insurance and life insurance, foreign or
              domestic, stock or mutual, more directly under the control of the Auditor and
              Treasurer of State. The report of the minority is signed by Mr. Givan and Mr. Barrett,
              and it proposes amendments in sections 2, 4, 8, 20, 27, 28, 29, (sub-stituted) 30, 36,
              38, 46, (strikes out 47, 48.) 52 and 68, and substitutes sections 60, 61 and 62but
              without materially changing the character of the original bill, which is copied
              chiefly from the New York laws.</p>
            <p>Mr. Jones said he would like to hear the original read by the Clerk.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wilson of Ripley. This was a very long bill, and the reported propositions to
              amend were so numerous and so material, that it would be necessary to have them
              printed; he would therefore suggest that the reading be deferred till the printing can
              be had.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kimball. It seemed to him that the bill, as it stands, needs but little
              amendment. All the amendment needed can be written in half a dozen lines.</p>
            <p>The Speaker. The clerk will read the original bill: and accordingly the bill was read
              through by the clerk.</p>
            <p>The debate thereon by Messrs. Kimball, Wilson, of Ripley, and Givan, is referred to
              the XlVth Brevier Reports App.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brett took the floor, but gave way for a motion to adjourn.</p>
            <p>Mr. Woodard filed his motion to reconsider the vote of yesterday rejecting Mr.
              Branham's railroad bill [H. R. 493]</p>
            <p>Mr. King also filed his motion to reconsider the vote of yesterday rejecting the
              claim, of J. Taylor</p>
            <p>Mr. Walker moved that the House do now adjourn till Monday at 2 o'clock P. M.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cauthorn and others demanded the yeas and nays, which were taken, and resulted,
              yeas, 41, nays, 38; whereupon the Speaker adjourned the House till Monday.</p>

            <p>Mr. Edwards, of Vigo, (Mr. Rudder in the chair).</p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, it is my sad duty to announce the death of my colleague, the Hon.
              Patrick Henry Lee, a Representative in this General Assembly from the county of Vigo,
              which occurred at the residence of his brother, in the city of Terre Haute, on
              Saturday, the 22d instant. Mr. Lee served among us during a few days at the beginning
              of the late special session, but, being stricken by disease, was compelled to obtain
              an indefinite leave of absence, and, under advice of his physicians, sought the more
              genial climate of the youth. He spent the winter at Aiken, South Carolina, in the vain
              hope of receiving some relief from his ailments, but finding none be returned to his
              home a week ago to-day</p>
            <lg type="free">
              <l>"To die amid kindred,</l>
              <l>Ending life where it began."</l>
            </lg>
            <p>My lamented colleague was with us so short a time, and was suffering to such an
              extent with his malady, and withal a gentleman of such modest demeanor and reticence,
              that you had no opportunity to estimate his ability, probity or excellence of
              character. He was a man of much more than ordinary natural talent, of studious and
              thoughtful habits, of good purposes and acts, and had before him a very promising
              future. He received his academical education at Indiana Asbury University, where he
              passed with credit most of the courses of that institution. Subsequently he entered
              upon the study of the law, but before he could complete his professional training he
              was compelled by illness and other circumstances to desist from and abandon ail plans
              for entering on the practice of his profession. During the last summer, although in
              feeble health, he yielded to the solicitations of friends, and accepted a nomination
              for the legislature, hoping that he would receive physical improvement from the
              exercise and excitement of the campaign. He made a close, careful and manly canvas of
              his county, but the labors he under-took in connection, therewith proved too great for
              his health, and he took his seat in the House in a most feeble bodily condition. If
              Mr. Lee had been permitted to have taken part in your labors he would have proved
              himself an active, intelligent and useful member, and have acquitted himself well of
              his legislative duties. His fine practical sense, courtesy of manner, and high moral
              rectitude, must have endeared him to you all. But such was not to be his fortune. The
              fatal disease had marked hsm for a speedy victim, and had well nigh sapped the
              foundation of his life ere he met with you. He was true in all the relations of life;
              a faithful and unostentatious Christian and met death with great tranquility and
              courage. He leaves behind him a name untarnished and a memory which will, long be
              cherished among all who knew him. Mr. Lee was the son of the late Dr. Henry D. Lee, a
              worthy and esteemed citizen of Vigo county, who died in 1871. His immediate relatives,
              to whom he was so much endeared in their affliction, have the sympathy of the
              constituency whom he was elected to represent. He leaves a devoted mother, four
              brothers, and five sisters, with other relatives of the highest respectability and
              influence, with whom he was a favorite. Mr. Lee was born in Vigo county, April 17,
              1845. His obsequies occur to-day. His remains will be followed to their last resting
              place, on the homestead where he was born, by a large and sorrowing concourse of
              relatives, friends and neighbors. The fact that his death occurred since the last
              adjournment, has alone prevented the making of arrangements on the part of this House,
              for a participation in his funeral rites. In view of this sad event, the only one of
              the kind which has occurred in this body; cutting off in the morning of his manhood,
              "from the places that knew him on earth, to know him no more forever," one of high
              hopes and aspirations, and these commended by merit. Connected as I was with the late
              incidents of his pure and upright life, it is proper that I should offer for adoption
              the following resolutions:</p>

            <p>Mr. Johnson said: Mr. Speaker - Mr. Lee was a stranger, in part, to almost every
              member of this body, except the few who sat in his immediate vicinity. Perhaps I knew
              him about as well as any member, his seat being immediately at my right. I speak now
              from the seat he occupied in this hall at the beginning of the special session. I had
              the pleasure, perhaps, of more constant intercourse with him than any other member,
              except the gentleman who occupied the seat on my right. I concur in the remarks of the
              gentleman from Vigo (Mr. Edwards) in regard to the character of the deceased member,
              both in an intellectual and moral point of view. There are various styles and stamps
              of intellectual force. One man has force, but has, perhaps, neither depth nor
              soundness, but each is cast in his own peculiar mould. That was a peculiar, but
              excellent, mould in which nature cast Patrick Henry Lee. In my brief acquaintance with
              him, observing him as other members on this floor, and listening to his conversation,
              I had an opportunity to observe him closer than most others; and I observed one
              peculiar trait in his intellectual character: It was the remarkable clearness of
              mental vision with which he viewed every particular question that came before the
              House. Though he was in very bad health till he left us, which was in a short time
              after he took his seat, but in drawing his inferences and stating his conclusions,
              there was not a man in the House that could express himself in words of greater power
              or force, or beauty; so that I formed the opinion of him that upon any question
              requiring a clear, comprehensive, incisive judgment, I would as soon risk him as any
              one on any question that might be before the House. He would comment in such a way
              that one single sentence or suggestion would seem a volume. Although there might be
              nothing peculiarly powerful or grand in his expression, yet it was always clear - it
              was like looking at a pebble at the bottom of a stream of pure water; it was just like
              that. When he expressed an idea, it was so clearly expressed that you could see right
              through his language into his mind. Sitting right here and talking in the ordinary
              way, he would seem to be wholly unconscious - and I have no doubt I was many times -
              of how much benefit one could derive from the simplest remarks he would drop, which
              would express so muchso grasping and clear were the views he would take. I feel, sir,
              that the members on this floor do not know what they have lost in the death of Mr.
              Lee, except, perhaps, the few that had their place near him in this hall, I feel that
              the State of Indiana has lost a great man. I feel that I am justified in saying, if he
              had lived into the years of his manhood, that all the people would have felt there was
              a great man in Mr. Lee. There was another peculiarity standing out in bold re- <pb
                n="199" xml:id="VAA8558-14-199"/> lief in his character, and that was the childlike
              simplicity and purity and sincerity of manner which he sustained and supported during
              the time that he sat with us here; whilst everything he said was as clear as the
              sunbeam and as pure as the sunlight itself, not the slightest intimation was ever
              heard from him departing from the strictest Christian morality. He was not only a
              gentleman, but superior far to that - he was a Christian gentleman - the noblest, the
              highest type of manhood. The gentleman from Vigo has referred to the example of his
              life, bright, and beautiful, and vigorous, and ingenuous. I ven-to say that he is not
              mistaken in the character. I know he is not! From the short acquaintance I had with
              him, I am able to see straight back to boyhood, and trace him from boyhood up to
              manhood. He must have been known and recognized as an amiable, incorrupt and upright
              boy, youth, and man. It could not have been otherwise. And in leaving us, we may have
              this to say of him, that in the path that was marked out by him - which was without
              guile - he stepped surely and safely in the way of virtue. He has left behind him,
              perhaps not wealth, not wide-spread fame, but that which is far nobler and grander
              than all these - an honorable name and a Christian, record, graven in the hearts of
              all his friends, and well remembered by his associates here as one of the most
              beautiful pictures on the walls of memory.</p>
            <p>Mr. Clark said those who are acquainted with the religious society of Friends, with
              which I am identified, know also that we as a people never wear any of the badges of
              mourning; therefore, I hope that, if we do not wear it on this occasion, it will not
              be taken as disrespectful.</p>
            <p>Mr. Smith said: Perhaps I know the deceased member better than any other gentleman on
              this floor, except the gentleman from Vigo, (Mr. Edwards.) It is with pleasure that I
              can look back upon the period of my acquaintance with him, which began at College at
              Greencastle; which associated us as members of the same literary society, and which so
              impressed my college life that I can safely avouch for all that has been said of him
              here: and I can say further, that I believe if he had been blessed with good health,
              he would have performed a distinguished part in the history of the State, and I can
              but think that he must have so lived as to die having as little to regret as any man.
              I well remember his first coming to the college, young and inexperienced; his rising
              rapidly in the estimation of teachers and students; the vigorous and successful
              prosecution of his studies, and the enviable distinction with which he left the
              school. And, because I am fully justified in doing so, I wish to add here my own
              hearty concurrence in all that has been said of this deceased member of the House of
              Representatives.</p>
            <p>On the motion of Mr. Gifford, the concurrent resolution was adopted unanimously and
              solemnly by the rising vote.</p>
            <p>And then according to this order (the Clerk having acquainted the Senate of its
              passage, and the Senate having responded by message announcing its adoption by that
              branch of the General Assembly) the House adjourned.</p>

                that command a just compensation for the services rendered. As a matter of policy,
                then, the State, in order to secure the very best legal talent for the Supreme

              <p>Mr. Collett advocated the passage of his bill. It was believed the State Geologist
                could induce heavy foreign manufacturers in steel to emigrate to this Stale, and
                take advantage of the mineral resources offered here in their line of business.</p>

              <p>Mr. Hubbard's bill [S. 176], supplemental to and repealing section 13 of the act of

                have passed it.</p>
              <p>The bill provides that, whenever any person shall be prosecuted for any murder,

                trying the defendant to find specifically whether such defendant was or was not
                insane when the alleged offense was committed, and whether such insanity was

                the period of two years, and as much longer as may be necessary to complete the cure
                of such defendant, but such defendant shall be kept wholly separate and apart from

              <p>The bill passed by yeas 38, nays 3.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregg, when his name was called, explain that the bill remedies the injurious

              <p>Mr. Dittemore's bill [S. 148] to provide for the re-location of county seats, and

                and insert 60 per cent shall sign the petition, and also to strike out the tenth
                section, adding ten per cent to the vote.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Dittemore the motion to re-commit was laid on the table by yeas

              <p>Mr. Neff's bill [S. 174] defining certain misdemeanors and prescribing punishment
                therefor - injuring any shrub, tree or property or ground used by agricultural,

              <p>On motion by Mr. Boone and Mr. Brown, and by unanimous consent, the word
                "unlawfully" was inserted before the word "injure."</p>
              <p>Mr. Neff explained that this bill was for the protection of the property of
                agricultural, horticultural or mechanical associations.</p>
              <p>The bill passed by yeas 41, nays 2.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hubbard's bill [S. 185] to authorize Judges of Circuit Courts and Court of
                Common Pleas to grant injunctions in certain cases pending in counties adjoining
                such circuit or district wherein the Judges of the courts within such circuit or
                district are disqualified from hearing such motions, and to authorize clerks to
                issue restraining orders was read the third time.</p>
              <p>The bill passed by yeas 40, nays 0; with an amendment of the title, viz: An act to

              <p>Mr. Steele's bill [S. 192] to amend section 5 of the property exemption act of
                February 17, 1852, was read the third time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele explained that where the two can not agree on the third appraiser, the
                officer holding the execution may select the third person.</p>
              <p>The bill passed the Senate by yeas 41, nays 0.</p>
              <p>Mr. Beeson's bill [S. 195] defining misdemeanors and declaring punishment thereof
                was read the third time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Beeson explained the only alteration to be to make a misdemeanor for violation
                of the act of May 21,1852, which prohibits the running at large of any stock not
                designated by the county commissioners.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown was willing to see the bill pass if it only affected vicious animals; but
                this cumulates the liability of persons who may allow their stock to run at
                large.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele thought any busy body in a neighborhood might cause much unnecessary
                trouble under this bill, and thought such a measure ought not to pass. Then, in some
                counties, the Board of Commissioners have made no order and the law of 1852 remains
                a dead letter on the statute book.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner spoke in favor of the bill and Mr. Dwiggins on the other side.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gooding demanded the previous question.</p>
              <p>The bill was rejected by yeas 14, nays 29.</p>
              <p>Mr. Carnahan's bill [S. 202] to amend section 7 <pb n="203" xml:id="VAA8558-14-203"
                /> and 9 of the common school law of March 6,1865, was read the third time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Carnahan explained that the only change from the present law is as to the time
                the township trustee is to report to the County Commissioners - from the 1st of
                March to the 1st of September of each year.</p>
              <p>The bill passed the Senate by yeas, 44; nays, 0.</p>
              <p>Mr. Beardsley's bill [S. 219] to provide for the construction and maintenance of
                fish ladders, was read the third time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele regarded this as an attempt to enforce a civil statute by a criminal
                action.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gooding thought the bill belongs to a class of special legislation.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregg understood that by fish ladders the fish can run over a very high dam.
                Some of the ladders are constructed in a zig zag shape, and others in different
                ways.</p>
              <p>Mr. Steele made an ineffectual motion to lay the bill on the table.</p>
              <p>The bill passed the Senate by yeas, 26; nays, 8.</p>
              <p>The Senate then adjourned till half-past nine o'clock to-morrow.</p>

          <p> The Speaker stated the unfinished pending question, viz: The adoption of the report of
            the minority of the Committee on Insurance as an Amendment to the report of the majority
            of wild committee amending the committee bill [S. R. 350.</p>
          <p>]Mr. Gregory asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill [S. R. 524] to authorize
            railroad companies organized under the laws of this State to make contracts for the use
            of their tracks by others, and to ratify bona fide contracts for these purposes

            <p>The Speaker repressed further motions to suspend the order of business and again

              on Insurance, returning the bill [H. R. 350] with amendments, as an amendment to the
              report of the majority of the same committee.</p>
            <p>After debate by Messrs. Brett. Walker, Mellett, Cobb and others, an ineffectual
              effort was made by Mr. Kimball to submit the original committee bill [H. R. 350] with
              modifications - making the Auditor of State the Commissioner of Insurance ex officio,
              and taxing foreign insurance companion on the net profits of their business, in the
              State, etc.; which was ruled out of order as being in the third degree; but he

              committee bill [H. R. 350] to organize insurance companies and to regulate the
              business of insurance in the State of Indiana, there being a majority and minority
              report thereon. The majority report is voluminous as to its proposed amendments,
              placing the business of insurance and life insurance, foreign or domestic, stock or
              mutual, more directly under the control of the Auditor and Treasurer of State,
              dispensing with the Insurance Commissioner, and striking out taxation on foreign
              companies, etc. The report of the minority is signed by Mr. Givan, and Mr. Barrett,
              and it proposes amendments in sections 2, 4, 8, 20,27, 28, 29, (substituted) 38, 36.
              28, 46, (strikes out 47, 48, 52 and 58, and substitutes sections 60, 61 and 62)but
              without more materially changing the original bill, which is understood to have been
              copied, from the New York insurance laws.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wilson, of Ripley, continued the debate, supporting the report of the majority of
              the Committee on Insurance, and he was followed by Mr. Lenfesty on the same side (for

            <p>The question recurring on the concurrence in the report of the majority of the

              dispensing with the official name, and giving the oversight of Insurance to the
              Auditor of State, and leaving foreign Insurance Companies without the provision for
              their taxation;Mr. Shirley submitted and ineffectual motion to lay it on the table -
              the vote thereon resulting - yeas 40, nays 46.</p>
            <p>The question again recurring on concurrence.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kimball now submitted his amendment to the bill, [H. R. 350] by way of substitute
              for the bill and amendments reported by the majority of the committee on insurance. It
              strikes out, and inserts the matter of the original committee bill so modified as to
              make the Auditor of State Commissioner of Insurance ex officio, and taxing foreign
              Insurance Companies on their premiums, less the amount of losses paid in the State,
              etc. He supported his substitute in a speech at length, when he had concluded.</p>
            <p>Mr. Woodard moved ineffectually to lay Mr.Kimball's substitute on the table - yeas,
              29; nays, 59.</p>
            <p>Mr. Walker proposed to lay the substitute offered by Mr. Kimball and the bill [H. R.
              350], with the reported amendments from the majority of the Committee on Insurance, on
              the table, and that one hundred copies of each be printed; and after a brief debate
              thereon, in which Messrs. Kimball, Lenfesty,and Rumsey participated, it was rejected
              without a division.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kimball's substitute for the bill as reported by the majority was then adopted -
              yeas, 57; nays, 31.</p>
            <p>The report, as thus amended, was then adopted on a division - affirmative, 56;

            <p>Mr. Walker moved that the further consideration of the subject be postponed, and that
              it be made the special order for to-morrow at two o'clock P. M., but on the motion of
              Mr. Baker, the motion was modified and the order was made for ten o'clock to-morrow
              morning.</p>
            <p>The Speaker laid before the House the annual report of the Trustees of the Wabash and
              Erie Canal, with accompanying documents.</p>

              committee of five for the investigation of certain charges claimed to have been

              followed taking away all occasion for the resolution, on motion of Mr. Johnson it was
              laid on the table.</p>

            <p> The Lieutenant Governor directed the reading of the minutes of yesterday's
              proceedings at half-past nine o'clock; but on motion the reading was dispensed
              with.</p>
            <p>The Lieutenant Governor laid before the Senate a communication from the Trustees of
              the Wabash and Erie canal, which was referred to the Committee on Finance without
              reading.</p>
            <p>Mr. Doggy's bill [S. 222] making it unlawful for owners or proprietors or billiard
              tables to suffer or permit minors to play thereon, or congregate about billiard tables
              or places where such pigeon hole, bagatelle or billiard table shall be kept for public
              use, without the consent of the parent or guardian; was read the third time. Penalty
              fine not less than $5, nor more than $500. Passed yeas 30, nays 7.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gregg's bill [S. 35] to amend section 23 of the general city incorporation act of
              March 14, 1867, having reference to the powers of the City Marshal, was read the third
              time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gregg said that all the change from the present law is that where a marshal makes
              an arrest on sight and without warrant he is permitted to hold the prisoner thirty-six
              hours when Sunday intervenes. Passed - yeas, 38; nays, 1.</p>
            <p>Mr. Steele's bill [S. 143] to restrain all persons from hiring or employing minors to
              vend or in any manner assist in making any intoxicating or spirituous liquor was read
              the third time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Steele said this bill was to prevent minors being taken into liquor sellers'
              establishments to assist in the manufacture or sale in any wray of any spirituous or
              intoxicating liquor.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gregg did not like the feature of this bill that prohibits the employment of
              minors about distilleries, as under the present United States law no liquor can be
              obtained in such places by man or boy.</p>
            <p>Mr. Slater regarded the provisions of this bill as right and just, so far as it
              refers to retail establishments, and if the reference to the whole-sale or
              manufacturing trade be stricken out, he would vote for the bill. He asked, but failed
              to obtain, unanimous consent to so amend the bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. Rosebrough, understanding this bill would interfere with the manufacture of
              native wine, would have to vote against it. Passed - yeas 39, nays 12.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hubbard's bill [S. 156] to authorize cities constructing water works to issue
              bonds and dispose of the same to aid in the construction of such water works, was read
              the third time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hubbard explained that the city of South Bend was deeply interested in this bill,
              and citizens there were very anxious for its early passage.</p>
            <p>Mr. Beardsley believed this would prove a dangerous law, as it gives this power into
              the hands of two-thirds of the members of the Common Council.</p>
            <p>Mr. Winterbotham suggested that there was no limit to the price these bonds would be
              sold for.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hubbard asked, and obtained unanimous consent, to insert a proviso that the bonds
              shall not be sold for less than ninety-seven cents on the dollar, nor bear more than
              ten per cent interest.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hall asked but failed to obtain unanimous consent to further amend the bill so
              that the Common Council shall not take action until a majority of the voters shall so
              petition. Passed - yeas 37, nays 7.</p>

              <head rend="center">FEES AND SALARIES.</head>
              <p>Mr. Rhodes called up the special order for this hour - the bill [S. 292] - from the
                  <orgName>Committee on Fees and Salaries</orgName>, for an act regulating the few
                of officers, and providing penalties for its violation, repealing certain acts
                therein named, and declaring an emergency. The question being on amendments reported
                by the committee - </p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner moved that the report be concurred in, and that the bill lie on the
                table and be printed.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Hall, this motion was laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown opposed delay, as this bill would have to pass the House before it became
                a law. The public demand some system of fees and salaries that will be uniform in
                practice throughout the State. Some county officers are acting under the new law and
                some under the old law.</p>
              <pb n="205" xml:id="VAA8558-14-205"/>
              <p>Mr. Rhodes hoped the mover would not insist on his motion. The committee have done
                as near right as possible, and if time is fritted away we will come to the day of
                adjournment without the passage of any bill on this subject at all.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Williams, it was ordered that the bill be considered by clauses
                and that the committee amendments be agreed to or rejected as they are come to.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hall moved a substitute for fees of the Secretary of State, a salary of $5,000. </p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Slater it was laid on the table with but one dissenting voice.</p>
              <p>Mr. Howard moved to strike from the third action the proviso that prohibits the
                Secretary of State from collecting fees for services rendered States or counties or
                officers thereof, or for commissions issued to elective officers in this State. Mr.
                Dwiggins offered a substitute for section 3, increasing the fees of the Secretary of
                State.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown favored the section as in the bill, with perhaps a little modification.
                Tabled.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Brown, the motion (Mr. Howard's was laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough moved to reduce the price for copying 100 words from fifteen to ten
                cents, in section 4. It was laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner moved to strike out the allowance to the clerk for bringing a record
                into court, was laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dittemore moved to allow for entering every motion in writing ten cents. It was
                laid the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Daugherty moved to strike out fees for searching records. Agreed to. Mr.
                Williams moved to reduce the fee for issuing marriage licenses from $2 to $1. It was
                laid on the table.</p>
              <p>On motion, by Mr. Rosebrough, the $1 fee for bills, etc., is to "include all of
                said service." Mr. Dittemore moved to make this fee $2. Tabled.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dittemore moved to make an allowance of $3 a day instead of $2 to clerks for
                attending courts.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner objected to appropriating out of the pockets of the people $3 a day to
                both clerks and sheriffs after they are fully and fairly compensated by the fee
                bills.</p>
              <p>The Senate refused to lay the amendment on the table: yeas 22, nays 23.</p>
              <p>Mr. Bird believed the clerk was entitled to $3a day if the sheriff is to be allowed
                that sum because the sheriff can hire a deputy for a less sum than the clerk, the
                latter requiring a man of more ability than the former.</p>
              <p>The amendment to give clerks $3 a day for attendance on courts was then agreed to
                by ayes 24, nays 22.</p>
              <p>Mr. Rosebrough and Mr. Sarnighausen voting"aye," desiring to put the clerks and
                sheriffs on the same footing in this regard,</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins offered a substitute for section 4, relating to fees of county clerks,
                so as to increase their fees in the smaller counties - pending the reading of
                which,</p>

            <p> Mr. Dittemore introduced a bill [S. 331] for an act fixing the times of holding
              commissioner's courts in counties having a population of 30,000 and upwardsone sitting
              each month. It was referred to the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary.</orgName>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Haworth offered a concurrent resolution directing the State Librarian to procure
              a full set of English and American herd books at a price not exceeding $200.
              Adopted.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bird, from the special committee thereon, returned the joint resolution [S. 11]
              instructing Indiana Congressmen, looking to the establishment of a district court for
              Northern Indiana at Fort Wayne, and for a distributing postoffice at said city, with
              amendments changing it to a concurrent resolution. Concurred in.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thompson offered a joint resolution [S. 11] concerning certain stationery
              purchased by the Librarian for the use of the General Assembly. Because the Auditor of
              State has refused to draw his warrant to pay for the same. The <orgName>Joint
                Committee on the State Library</orgName> is directed to examine into and report the
              facts in relation thereto.</p>
            <p>It was referred to the <orgName>Joint Committee on Public Libraries</orgName>.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown, from the <orgName>Committee on Railroads</orgName>, returned the bill [S.
              328] to authorize railroad companies to change their termini in certain cases, with a
              favorable report thereon. Concurred in.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dwiggins presented six claims in the Burson contested election case of 1871,
              which were referred to the <orgName>Committee on Claims</orgName>, without

              <head rend="center">ASSESSMENT FOR TAXATION.</head>
              <p>Mr. Boone, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned the bill [S.
                294] to amend the assessment act of December 21, 1872, with amendments repealing
                section 255, 256 and 257.</p>
              <p>Mr. Harney opposed concurrence in this report.</p>
              <p>Mr. Boone said the rules laid down in these sections would not be sustained in
                cases of sales on execution much less to a sale for taxes. </p>
              <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
              <p>Mr. Howard moved to recommit the bill with instructions to amend so as to allow the
                assessor till August 1st of each year to complete and make out his returns, giving
                four months instead of two.</p>
              <p>Mr. Rhodes said that under the new bill the assessor's work will be much more than
                ever before, and therefore this amendment is very necessary.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams was of opinion the amendment would give the auditor too short a time
                to make out the duplicates.</p>
              <p>Mr. Harney hoped the bill would not pass. </p>
              <p>Mr. Howard reminded Senators that under the old law these assessments were returned
                on the first of June, and the auditor had one more month in which to make out his
                duplicate than he will have under the new law. Two months is not a sufficient time
                to make assessments under the new law; it will require at least three months.</p>
              <p>The friends of the bill, when it passed last session, assured us its defects should
                be remedied by supplemental law, and now when this is proposed to be done it is met
                at the threshhold with opposition. Upon a close examination of this law in the mode
                and manner of its execution it will cast upon this Legislature more stigma than any
                law it has passed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams suggested that County Commissioners could adjourn over in order to
                give the Assessors further time to complete their lists.</p>
              <p>The Senate refused to lay the motion to refer on the table.</p>
              <p>It was then agreed to by yeas 25, nays 44.</p>
              <p>Mr. Daugherty moved to further instruct the committee to reinstate sections 255,
                256 and 257 of the original law.</p>
              <p>Mr. Bunyan moved that these instructions be laid on the table. Agreed to.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved to further instruct the committee to amend by striking out
                sections 8 and 9 requiring insurance companies to pay a tax of two per cent. of
                their gross earnings.</p>
              <p>Mr. Slater raised the point of order that the matter was not in order, which point
                of order was sustained by the Chair.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved to reconsider the vote by which the amendment to the bill was
                adopted. Mr. Slater moved to lay the motion on the table.</p>
              <p>This motion was agreed to by yeas 30, nays 14.</p>
              <p>Mr. Sleeth moved, ineffectually, to further instruct the committee to investigate
                the propriety <pb n="206" xml:id="VAA8558-14-206"/> of repealing section 57 and

                not receive more than one per cent for receiving and disbursing county monies.</p>
              <p>Mr. Haworth moved to amend by way of substitute, allowing treasurers eight per cent
                on the first $1,000, seven per cent on the second thousand, six per cent on the
                third thousand, five per cent of the fourth thousand, four per cent on from four to

              <p>It was laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown moved, ineffectually, to substitute $5 for $1 as the fee for a plat of
                subdivisions of townships. He also moved to increase the fee to $2 50. It was laid
                on the table.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Rhodes, the fee for disbursement of school revenue was fixed at
                one-fourth of one per cent.</p>

              <p>Mr. Haugh made an ineffectual motion - yeas 18, nays 22 - to lay the amendment on
                the table.</p>
              <p>It was rejected by yeas 17, nays 24.</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner moved to reduce the per diem for attendance on Commissioners Courts
                from $3 to $2. It was laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Rhodes moved to allow the Auditor for making footings of tax duplicates,

              <p>On motion of Mr. Rhodes, the per diem of riding bailiffs was fixed at $3, and other
                bailiff at $2.Mr. Cave moved to make the per diem of each fifty cents a day higher.
                This amendment to the amendment was agreed to.</p>
              <p>The amendment [Mr. Scott's] as amended was agreed to.</p>
              <p>Mr. Howard moved an amendment providing that fees taxed for services performed by
                bailiffs shall go into the county treasury.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins did not think the amendment would amount to any thing, because
                bailiffs would not be sent to perform such service.</p>
              <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
              <p>Mr. Slater moved to amend by reducing the printers fee for first insertion, brevier
                measure, from $2 to $1 75, and each additional insertion from $1 to 75 cents. Agreed

            <p>Mr. Cauthorn moved, ineffectually, that the general court bill [S. 238] be taken up;
              but after discussion, by unanimous consent, the House took up the bill [S. 238] for an
              act to divide the State in judicial circuits for judicial purpose, fix the time of
              holding courts therein, abolishing the courts of common pleas and transferring the
              business thereof to the circuit courts, providing for the election of Judges and
              Prosecuting Attorneys in certain cases(it divides the State into thirty-six judicial
              circuits, abolishes the courts of common pleas, the office of district attorney, etc)
              - and it was read by the clerk.</p>
            <p>Mr. C. then moved that the constitutional rule be suspended, the bill read the second
              time, and then referred to the joint committee for redistricting the State for
              judicial purposes.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lenfesty proposed to amend the motion so as to refer the bill to a special
              committee of one from each Congressional district.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gregory moved to lay Mr. Lenfesty's amendment to the motion on the table, which
              was agreed to - yeas 50, nays 38.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mellett proposed to amend the motion so as to make it simply a reference of the
              bill to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee.</orgName></p>
            <p>Mr. Offutt proposed that it be referred to the <orgName>Committee on the Organization
                of Courts</orgName>.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mellett accepted.</p>
            <p>Mr. Woollen urged that the bill ought in all - propriety to go back to the Committee
              which had already given it so much attention.</p>
            <p>Mr. Smith urged the adoption of Mr. Mellett's motion.</p>
            <p>Mr. Offutt considered that the bill needed amendment.</p>
            <p>Mr. Walker submitted facts and conclusions In favor of the reference to the Joint
              Judicial Districting Committee. It would save time, which has become specially
              precious here.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Givan, Mr. Mellett's motion was laid on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. Givan then demanded the previous question, and there was a second. The main
              question: Shall the constitutional rule be suspended arid the bill read the second
              time now? was taken and decided in the affirmative - yeas 60, nays 29 - and
              accordingly the bill was read the second time by title.</p>
            <p>Mr. Smith proposed to amend the bill by striking out "Hendricks" from the fourteenth
              section, and inserting "Hendricks" in section twenty.</p>
            <p>Mr. Woolen suggested that it would be better to refer these amendments to the joint
              committee.</p>
            <p>Mr. Smith acquiesced.</p>
            <p>The bill was then referred to the <orgName>Judicial Joint Committee</orgName>.</p>
            <p>Messrs. Ogden, Hardesty and Peed presented memorials remonstrating against the

              <head rend="center">THE NORMAL SCHOOL.</head>
              <p>The bill [S. 153] amending sections fourteen and fifteen of the normal school act,
                and appropriating about $15,000 out of the common school fund for that institution,
                was taken upon the third reading.</p>
              <p>Mr. Givan, Mr. Mellett and Mr. Ramsey showed that the object of the bill is to make
                appropriations which are absolutely necessary for the successful carrying on of the
                Normal School.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregory opposed the bill because the approptiation was to deplete the school
                fund, It was a violation of section three, article eight, of the Constitution. He
                was willing to support the Normal School, but not out of that fund.</p>
              <p>Mr. Woollen showed that the school fund was raised by taxation, and the interest on
                the fund was not contemplated in the constitutional provison; only the principal of
                the fund. This was a msot just and appropriate as well as a very much needed
                appropriation.</p>
              <p>Mr. Branham. It is simply a question whether we shall increase the amount already
                appropriated for the normal school.</p>
              <p>The bill was finally passed the House of Representatives - yeas, 51; nays, 38.</p>

              <p>Mr. Cauthorn, from the <orgName>Committee on Temperance</orgName>, returned Mr.

                strike out the third section, and so amended, the committee recommend the passage of

              <p>Mr. Hollingsworth supported its provisions notwithstanding the emasculations to
                which it has been subjected. It provides simply that no man shall drink intoxicating
                liquors and hold office at the same time and it could work no hard-ship.</p>
              <p>Mr. Baxter moved that the bill be laid on the table; which motion was rejected by

                part of public officers, and to provide for removal from office therefor."</p>
              <p>The Speaker now returned to the special order, via: the Governor's veto of the act
                resulting from Mr. Buskirk's bill [H. R. 71] to amend section six of the act of
                March 14, 1867, for the incorporation of cities. The Governor recites the delay of
                the bill after it was presented to him for signature on the 12th inst., (by an order
                of the Senate for its withdrawal,) from the 14th to the 21st inst., and the opinion
                of the Attorney General, that the time of delay should not be counted in the three
                full days which the Constitution allows the Governor for the consideration of a bill
                so presented to him. He then recites the provisions of the act proposed to be
                amended, and the material amendment of the enrolled act, viz: to enable cities by
                petition and vote of a majority of freeholders by taxation to aid in the
                construction of bridges which may have a terminus therein, and to aid in the
                construction of other public works of public utility. He objects, not to the
                specific authority to aid in the construction of bridges, but to the vagueness of
                the objects for which it is proposed to confer authority for aid by taxation in "the
                construction of permanent public works and works of public utility." His Excellency
                also cites the reasoning of Governor Baker on the principle of conferring a vague
                and general sovereignty on majorities.</p>
              <p>Mr. Walker was informed that there is a bill from the Senate (Senator Hall's) for
                the object which this bill contemplates obviating the Governor's objections, and he
                would therefore move that the matter be indefinitely postponed.</p>
              <p>The Speaker. It is a constitutional question here: "Will the House pass the bill,
                the objections of the Governor to the contrary notwithstanding?" The motion is
                therefore out of order.</p>
              <p>The returned act was then rejected by the House of Representatives - yeas 86, nays
                0.</p>
              <p>Mr. Baker moved ineffectually to take up the Senate bill No. 254 - the bill

              <p>The Speaker now returned to the special order, viz: the consideration of the
                committee bill [H. R. 350] to organize insurance companies, regulating the business
                of insurance, etc.</p>
              <p>Mr. Wilson, of Ripley, proposed to amend the bill by striking out the words
                "insurance commissioner" wherever they occur in the bill, and insert "Auditor of
                State" in lieu; striking out section 7; in section 22, strike out "member" and
                insert "stockholders" in lieu; in section 30, insert "expenses and dividends." in
                section 45, strike out "annually" and insert "semi-annually" in lieu; strike out
                sections 47, 48, 50, 52, 55, 56; amend section 45, inserting "and shall pay the same
                into the State Treasury."</p>
              <p>Mr. Kimball indicated a motion to lay all these amendments on the table except the
                first, and subsequently the first amendment was adopted by unanimous consent.</p>
              <p>Mr. Wilson's second amendment striking out section 7 was adopted - yeas 60, nays
                26.Mr. Wilson's third amendment striking out and inserting "members and stockholder"
                was adopted by consent.</p>
              <p>Mr. Wilson's fourth amendment: in section thirty, after the word "losses," insert
                "expenses and dividends," was next considered. He said this bill proposes to tax
                three per cent of the gross receipts, exempting losses. I propose to add "expenses
                and dividends." It was rejected - yeas 40, nays 50.</p>
              <p>Mr. Wilson's fifth amendment, to strike out "annually" and insert "semi-annually,"
                in lieu was next considered. Mr. W. thought that under this bill, the Auditor would
                have very little to do in issuing these certificates, even if they were made
                semi-annually.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brett and Mr. Millett considered the Auditor's compensation should hardly come
                in here - they were willing that he should have a just compensation for his

              <p>Mr. Kimball. The bill proposes $1,000 to the Auditor, and $2,000 for his
                deputy.</p>
              <p>Mr. Cauthorn moved ineffectually to lay the amendment on the table - yeas 36, nays
                49.</p>
              <p>Mr. Johnson. How much will the Auditor receive for these certificates under this
                bill? He was informed that the Auditor received $2 for each license.</p>
              <p>Mr. Wilson. If it drive out foreign companion, as I believe it will, his
                compensation will be very small.</p>
              <p>Mr. Shirley. If the Auditor has been receiving $15,000 a year for this business,
                this bill can't do more than cut down his receipts one-half, and that would be too
                much. It is time to put a stop to these fortunes in public offices.</p>
              <p>After further remarks in this direction by Messrs. Wilson of Ripley, Branham,
                Lenfesty, Cauthorn and others,</p>
              <p>Mr. Brett referred again to a statement which he made yesterday, which he supposed
                to be true because it remained uncontradicted, that the Auditor of State receives
                now over $14,000 a year on account of this insurance business, for issuing licenses
                twice a year to insurance agents, as the law now stands. If, then, the insurance
                business shall continue as it is, and this amendment is adopted, the Auditor will
                receive for this service over $15,000. He thought the decrease which was predicted
                by the operations of this bill would hardly be realized, for he understood that such
                was not the result of this kind of legislation in other States. But if it diminishes
                the insurance business one-half, the Auditor will still receive $7,000 from this
                source.</p>
              <p>Mr. Lenfesty. Where did the gentleman from Daviess get that paper which he read
                yesterday.</p>
              <p>Mr. Baker (on his seat). I copied it from the auditor's books.</p>
              <p>Mr. Wilson, of Ripley. There is another amendment that is to strike out the
                auditor's deputy hire,</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregory. It was a startling revelation to him that the auditor of State has
                been drawing $14,500 from the insurance department; and now by this amendment he is
                to make by the issuing of certificates twice as much.</p>
              <p>Mr. Kimball. By this bill the auditor of State is to have a deputy paid by the
                State, while before he had no deputy except as he paid him out of his own
                pocket.</p>
              <p>After further debate by Messrs. Mellett, Givan and others, the amendment was
                rejected - yeas 38, nays 49.</p>
              <p>The next amendment, proposed by Mr. Wilson, to strike out section 49, creating the
                office of Commisioner of Insurance, was laid on the table - yeas 45, nays 43.</p>
              <pb n="209" xml:id="VAA8558-14-209"/>
              <p>Mr. Kimball proposed to amend the section 49 so as to make it constitute the
                Auditor of State ex officio Commissioner of Insurance; which was adopted on a
                division - affirmative 45, negative 43.</p>
              <p>Mr. Wilson's next amendment was to strike out section 53, which provides, amongst
                other things, that foreign insurance companies shall loan sixty per cent of their
                reserves within the State of Indiana; whereupon Mr. W. said: The State of New York
                requires all her companies to loan all their reserves in the State of New York.
                There are a great many citizens of Indiana who hold policies of insurance in these
                New York companies, and if we pass this section we compel these New York companies
                to retire from doing business in this State; because of another section of this law
                we make it a misdemeanor for them to continue, and they can't send an agent here to
                collect a premium. The effect will be then to compel all those citizens of Indiana
                who have policies in these companies to forfeit them. And so far as that goes, these
                companies will be gainers. I ask that this section be stricken out on the part of
                those men who are insured in these New York companies.</p>
              <p>After further debate by Messrs. Gregory, Richardson, Baker, Cauthorn, Walker,
                Kimball, and others, the proposed amendment by striking out was laid on the table -
                yeas, 46; nays, 37.</p>
              <p>Mr. Johnson read a dispatch from Mr. Spellman (confined at his room with
                diptheria,) asking leave of absence, which was accorded by consent.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gregory obtained a suspension of the order of business to enable him to
                introduce a preamble and resolution for night sessions commencing at half past seven
                P. M., which lies over till to-morrow. Adjourned.</p>

                both Houses to take steps to build one, but he did not like this resolution.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown hoped some decisive action will be taken so as to construct and complete
                a new State House at the earliest possible moment; but as the resolution was vague
                and ambiguous, he moved to refer it to a special committee of three, with
                instructions to report at ten o'clock to-morrow. He desired the bill to be proposed
                and submitted to this General Assembly.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott also wanted the bill submitted to this General Assembly, and moved to
                amend the res- <pb n="212" xml:id="VAA8558-14-212"/> olution so the committee shall
                report the bill to this General Assembly. Agreed to. The resolution as amended was
                adopted by yeas 44, nays 2.</p>
              <p>The Presiding officer laid before the Senate a communication from the Governor
                embracing a report of the commission appointed to consider matters relating to the
                enlargement of the State House grounds, stating that said commission have contracted
                with the owners of the ground referred to in the act authorizing this commission by
                which the State is to allow the owners $300 per foot, amounting to $19,500; the
                State to have a fee simple title and immediate possession.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Gregg the communication was referred to the Joint Committee
                provided for in the House concurrent resolution just adopted.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Winterbotham, the constitutional restriction was dispensed with -
                yeas 43, nays 0 - and his bill [S. 273], to amend section 53 of the city
                incorporation act of March 14, 1867, so as to enable cities to construct wharves,
                dikes, piers and basins, fix the rates of wharfage, etc., was read by title only for
                the second reading, read by sections for the third reading, and passed the Senate by
                yeas 42, nays 2.</p>
              <p>Mr. Winterbotham and Mr. Hubbard explaining that the intention of this bill is to
                legalize a similar one passed by the last Legislature; the words ''and public
                landing" being the only ones added.</p>
              <p>Mr. Thompson moved to suspend the constitutional rule and take up the bill [H. R.
                417] governing costs in the superior courts of this State, as the superior court is
                now collecting its cost without authority of law.</p>
              <p>The motion was agreed to and the bill was passed to the final reading, and passed
                the Senate by yeas 41, nays 0.On motion of Mr. Gooding, his bill [S. 264] for an act
                to amend the charter of the city of Evansville so that councilmen may be elected
                alternately, was read the second time by title, the third time by sections, and
                passed the Senate under a dispensation of the constitutional restriction, by yeas

          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center"> INSURANCE LAWS.</head>
            <p>The Speaker now returned to the unfinished business, viz., the Committee Insurance
              bill [H. R. 350] to organized Insurance companies, and to regulate the business of
              insurance, etc. The question being on the motion of Mr. Wilson of Ripley to strike out
              section 53.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shirley knew something about the effect of this taking money out of the State by
              New York Insurance Companies. There is a mistake about it. Those insurance laws of New
              York are having no effect here. The money which these company's agents get here goes
              to New York, thence into the hands of brokers, and it is immediately brought back and
              loaned out here. It is so done in his country, and he was informed that it has been
              done extensively in this city recently. We should take this twist out of the hands of
              New York. It was weakness to say that Indianians can't live without the money of New
              York Insurance Companies.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wilson. Do you state that they do loan, or that they can loan ?</p>
            <p>Mr. Shirley. While the Company can't do it in their own name, they do loan such money
              to brokers and the brokers loan it here, and we pay the brokers' premium of about
              three per cent.</p>
            <p>Mr. Miller. What we want is security. If this section will give us security we should
              retain it; if not, we should not retain it. It is conceded that it will debar the New
              York companies from loaning their reserves here - and he gave illustrations of its
              operations. As the law is, I can sue the company's agent in my own county: but if this
              section is retained I would have to go to the State of New York to serve the process
              before I could institute suit and obtain judgment. Again: to have cheap insurance we
              must have competition. And to vote for this section will be to increase the price we
              will have to pay for insurance, because it will destroy competition.</p>
            <p>Mr. Smith opposed the section because it is not free trade. The tax will come upon
              the people by indirection, and this is a dangerous principle. It will materially raise
              the rates of insurance, and we would be compelled to do business with home insurance
              companies.</p>
            <p>Mr. Walker. This section does not compel them to loan their reserves in this
              State.</p>
            <p>Mr. Smith. Then I was mistaken. But we are proposing to compel these companies to
              loan money where we have the worst collection laws perhaps in the Union. We ought not
              to discriminate by legislation against the State of New York. Those companies who do
              the best insurance business ought to have a fair field.</p>
            <p>The section 53 was then stricken out - yeas 46, nays 39.</p>
            <p>The question recurred on Mr. Wilson, of Ripley's next amendment, to amend section 54
              by striking out these words, "and shall pay the same into the State Treasury to the
              credit of the insurance fund." Mr. W. said the section now provides that these fees
              "shall be paid into the State Treasury to the credit of the insurance fund, out of
              which the expenses of the department are to be paid." Since the amendments which have
              been made to the bill, that is not applicable. I think that these fees should be given
              to the Auditor of State, and whatever we give him should be well defined. This bill
              requires examinations by the Auditor, involving much labor: and if we leave the
              compensation undefined, it will be almost impossible to tell what it will amount to.
              This section is not for revenue, but for the expenses of the Auditor; and as all the
              expenses in the department are to go to the Auditor, it seems to me entirely
              unnecessary to put it into the treasury and thcu pay it back again to the Auditor.</p>
            <p>Mr Shirley was in favor of so framing the bill that we may know exactly what the
              Auditor gets.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kimball. Does not the bill as it stands determine exactly what the Auditor shall
              have? two dollars for every license, and $1,000 in addition to his regular salary? If
              there is any surplus after paying the expenses of the department, are not the people
              entitled to it?</p>
            <p>Mr. Woolen found that these specifications gave the Auditor for filing a statement
              $25. This filing simply could not be as compensation for service, for if it were, the
              pay might be about five cents or ten cents. Then there was for his examination of an
              annual statement $50, which would require but a few hours time. This was a tax for the
              purpose of sustaining officers - was wrong in principal.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wilson. There are a great many things <pb n="213" xml:id="VAA8558-14-213"/> which
              the Auditor has to do under this bill for which he gets no compensation.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brett. The insurance companies wouldprefer that the law remain as it is now, and
              the law now gives the Auditor more money than the combined salaries of the three
              Judges of the Supreme Court. Should that be done? He would say, let the Auditor have a
              just and established compensation.</p>
            <p>After further debate by Messrs. Wilson, of Ripley, Rumsey and Kimball, the amendment
              was rejected.</p>
            <p>The next question was on the motion of Mr. Wilson of Ripley to strike out section 55.
              Mr. W. said: This section makes a special law of the State of Indiana for every
              different insurance company doing business here which is organized under the laws of
              any other State in the Union. It is just simply to bring the insurance laws of every
              other State into our own. It is not competent for the Legislature to bring in the laws
              of Kentucky to govern one insurance company, and the laws of Massachusetts to govern
              another, for our Constitution requires general laws.</p>
            <p>Mr. Woollen. This section requires these companies to come under the laws of this
              State. Shall we kneel down humbly before the legislation of other States
              discriminating against us? The Scripture doctrine of "an eye for an eye and a tooth
              for a tooth" has a fair application here.</p>
            <p>After debate by Messrs. Gregory and Miller, the amendment was rejected.</p>
            <p>The Speaker announced the next amendment Mr. Wilson, of Ripley, whereupon Mr. W.
              asked by and obtained leave to withdraw it; and he then submitted other amendments to
              the bill to this effect: Strike out the enacting clause; strike out sections 25, 26,
              30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42; insert a provision requiring every
              life Insurance company doing business in the State to file a yearly statement of its
              business with the Auditor of State on or before the first day of December; insert
              section 26. prescribing the time (December 31) when the receivers shall report to the
              Auditor; striking out sections 1 to 13, 16, 19, 20, 21, and inserting voluminous
              matter.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kimball. If I am not mistaken, that sounds very much like the report which the
              gentleman from Ripley made the other day.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wilson denied the alleged identity, and debate followed by Messrs. Walker,
              Kimball, and others.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gregory moved that all these amendments be indefinitely postponed, the vote
              thereon being urged by the previous question, and determined by yeas and nays,
              resulted in rejecting the motion to postpone on three branches of the amendment, when
              the House took the recess till two o'clock P. M. </p>

            <p>The Speaker resumed the unfinished business, and the force of the previous, question
              was exhausted by the House refusing to indefinitely postpone the motion to strike out
              section 26 of the bill No. 350 - yeas 42, nays 45.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wilson of Ripley now demanded the previous question on the adoption of his
              amendments, and there was a second; whereupon, there being demanded a division or the
              question on the several amendments, the House refused to strike out the enacting
              clause of the bill, by yeas 45, nays 47.</p>
            <p>The House refused to strike out section 25, which requires the Auditor to examine the
              accounts of receivers of insurance and "report errors to the courts, which are
              required to make such orders thereon as to law and justice may appertain," by yeas 31,
              nays 49.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wilson of Ripley claimed that the force of the previous question is now
              exhausted; and then - </p>

                Insurance</orgName>; with instructions; which was agreed to - yeas 48, nays 45.</p>
            <p>The Speaker laid before the House a communication from the Secretary of State,
              transmitting the response of the Secretary of the Chicago Law Institute to the
              concurrent resolution of the General Assembly confirming the donation by the Governor

            <p>Mr. Branham obtained leave to return from the <orgName>Committee on Benevolent
                Institutions</orgName>, his bill [H. R 508] to make further provisions for the care
              and treatment of the insane of the State, with Amendments: in section one so as to
              make the location north of the parallel of Indianapolis; in section 5 the word
              "donations" be stricken out. And further amend so as to read: "Not less than eighty or
              more than 160 acres." All salaries to be approved by the Board of Control; all
              expenditures of the institution to be under the supervision of the Board of Control of
              the Auditor, Secretary and Treasurer of State: and it appropriates $50,000 for the
              year ending October, '73, and $350,000 for the year ending October, '74not to be drawn
              without the advice and concurrence of the Governor. The yearly allowance of the (two)
              commissioners shall be the same with the commissioners for the Hospital for the
              Insane.</p>
            <p>Mr. Furnas opposed the proposition. It would be more expensive to have two sets of
              officers.</p>
            <p>Mr. Heller. The two sets of officials would not amount to so much as the expenses of
              patients' travel back and forth to the more distant hospital.</p>
            <p>Mr. Branham. The committee have already reported for the enlargement of the Insane
              Hospital here to the extreme limit to which it can be economically done. The committee
              also weighed carefully the question of location. The provisions of the bill leave it
              with the officers to make the location untrammeled, except that it shall go north of
              Indianapolis. It is due to the people of the State that these institutions which
              absorb so much revenue should be distributed for the convenience of the people. There
              was another matter that had weight with the committee. It is certain that 75 per cent.
              of the entire revenue of the State is expended in Marion county, and certainly no more
              than that should be put in here, unless the public necessity requires it, for such a
              course would make it sometimes, perhaps, difficult to obtain the requisite
              appropriations for the benevolent institutions. Then the statistics show that the care
              of the insane is proportionately greater in the northern part of the State.</p>
            <p>Mr. Butterworth advocated the northern location, for convenience and economy of the
              going and coming of patients and their friends.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cobb. We have more people, and we pay more taxes and fines in the north than any
              other part of the State.</p>
            <p>Mr. Givan. Does the payment of taxes make people crazy?</p>
            <p>Mr. Branham. I think so; if you keep on at this rate.</p>

            <p>On motion of Mr. Ogden, the 14th and 20th sections were amended so as to connect the

            <p>Mr. Edwards, of Vigo, (Mr. Walker in the chair) submitted a motion to amend further
              by striking from the 14th section the words, "and Sullivan," so as to give to Vigo
              county a separate circuit. The county of Vigo is one of the largest counties in the
              State, and ought to be a separate circuit as much as the county of Wayne; and besides
              this, the people in Wayne are peaceable, requiring little or no litigation, while we
              in Vigo are a business people and have litigations.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Gregory, the proposed amendment was laid on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gronendyke also made an ineffectual motion to amend in sections 22, 31, 32, 67
              and 68 so as to change the circuits for the counties of Warren, Parke, etc.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Woollen, it was ordered that the amendments be considered as
              engrossed,and the bill as amended, he read the third time now.</p>
            <p>Mr. Heller. Mr. Speaker: If ever the old adage that politics makes strange bed
              fellows was verified it is now by the supporters of this bill. At the last session
              there was an apportionment bill passed here, and those who acted with me signed a
              protest against it as a fraud on the people. But now I find men on my side joining the
              opposition and proposing to commit a fraud upon the people ten times more damnable
              than that. This bill proposes to legislate over thirty of the best men in the State
              out of office, and leaves them ineligible for four years to any other office from the
              time of their election. Gentlemen may put that in their pipes and smoke it. That is
              one of the bad features in this bill, that we have no right to enact under the
              Constitution. We have been perfecting our present judicial system for the past twenty
              years, and it is proposed by this enactment to strike down the whole system and begin
              anew in an untried field. When perhaps in less than ten years we will adopt a new
              Constitution, then all this will go for nothing. The manner in which gentlemen
              electioneer for this bill is carious in the extreme. When any one tells the gentleman
              from Knox [Mr. Cauthorn] that he does not intend to vote for the bill, he indignantly
              gets up and makes right off on his ear like a mad steer going through a cornfield,
              ribs distended, back bowed up and the tuft on his tall sailing higher than the corn
              tassels. [Laughter.]</p>
            <p>I know the gentleman from Johnson [Mr.Woollen] denies many things that the bill
              proposes, but he will find as he goes round pulling wool for shoe - thread in the way
              he does that he will come out with much more wool than thread. And one gentleman
              reminds me of a whiffet who rushes out through the fence in front of a farm house and
              pulls a few threads from the legs of the travelers breeches and thus excites Bull and
              Touser to the attack, whips back again through the pailing barks and scratches sand
              and gravelwell just thinks he has done it. [Great laughter.] We are only a match for
              them in one thing, they have the Delaware Chief; we, to balance accounts, can glory in
              the thought that the Wabash giant [Mr. Cowgill] is on our side. Why sir, the first
              thing we know the gentleman from Wayne [Mr. Walker] will lift the curtain from his
              marble brow, throw out his enormous wings and soar to the clouds, from whence he will
              drive his thunderbolts through this hall, spit his liquid fire all over us, then
              deftly snatch a varigated ribbon from the rainbow kindly condescend to descend to
              mother earth and wrapped in the glory of his own feelings assist the unharmed in
              caring for his dead and dying. [Voices: "Louder," "louder!" with laughter.] The people
              of the State can not afford the ex <pb n="217" xml:id="VAA8558-14-217"/> pense that
              will be involved by this measure. In Allen county we have three Courts and they are
              all behind; abolish one and where will we be? We have 60 or 70 lawyers, and but two of
              them so far as I know are in favor of this bill. Therefore I do protest against its
              passage. It leaves the way open for four grand juries every Circuit Court can call a
              grand jury. I know that the gentleman from Johnson denies this, but it is only for the
              purpose of pulling wool over our eyes.</p>
            <p>This is one of the force puts which I claim is no put at all. And the friends of the
              bill are all the time demanding the previous question. They are afraid to let the
              discussion of it go to the people, and it is only by my stubborn persistance that I
              now have the floor. We have here plenty of Senators and Representatives who desire to
              be judges and are bound to pass this bill, notwithstanding the difference in some of
              the districts in population is at least 40,000. What can there be in such a measure
              that is honest and just? The proposition is to increase the salaries to $3,000 for
              thirty-eight judges that will amount to $114,000. At the next regular session they
              expect to come here and double the number which will make 76 in all increasing the
              expense to 228,000. So it is plain to be seen that this is but the entering wedge and
              what will follow remains to be seen.</p>

                yesterday, viz: requiring said joint committee to report their bill to this General
                Assembly, and at this session, were taken up and concurred in; whereupon the Speaker
                appointed said committee on the part of the House of Representatives, viz: Messrs.

              <head rend="center">THE PUBLIC PRINTING.</head>
              <p>The Speaker now took up the special order, viz: the consideration of the committee
                bill [H. R. 526] to provide for the public printing and binding, with majority and
                minority reports thereon from the ,<orgName>Special Committee on Printing</orgName>,
                heretofore described in these reports. The question being on the adoption of the
                minority as an amendment to the majority report - </p>
              <p>Mr. Woollen stated some of the provisions of the bill as reported by the minority.
                The majority and minority have reported for the contract system; the minority report
                a bill after the Ohio public printing law, matured and perfected in the experience
                of twenty-five years.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hardesty supported the bill reported by the majority of the committee, and
                stated amongst the advantages over the proposition of the minority that it contains
                in section seven a provision that the State shall not be a party in any purchase of
                paper, type, ink, or other material used in such work.</p>
              <p>Mr. Walker briefly advocated the bill of the majority on account of its brevity,
                the fact that it is recommended by men practical in the printing business, and the
                advantages alleged by Mr. Hardesty.</p>
              <p>Mr. Shirley spoke for the minority bill and insisted that the majority bill does
                not sufficiently invite competition among the bidders; it does not let the work to
                the lowest bidder.</p>
              <p>Mr. Wilson, of Ripley, defended the provisions of the majority bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. Lenfesty suggested that the provisions of the fifth section might leave the way
                open for fraudulent combinations, and preferred the majority bill because it invites
                bids for all the work outside, as well as within, the city of Indianapolis, while
                the minority report requires that two classes of the work shall be done in this
                city.</p>
              <p>Mr. Mellett supported the majority bill, in the belief that it will afford the best
                printing for the State for the least money, and because it cuts off the practice by
                which the State has heretofore furnished the paper for the public printing, which
                has been the occasion of some of the most grievous frauds upon the treasury.</p>
              <p>Mr. Woodard considered that the majority had submitted a fair bill, the work of
                practical printers; and objected to the minority bill because of its voluminousness
                and liability, therefore, to diverse constructions. He closed by demanding the
                previous question, which he was, however, induced to withdraw.</p>
              <p>Mr. Billingsley gave his preference to the majority bill, for the reasons
                heretofore suggested.</p>
              <p>Mr. Woollen said the old law contained no provision in regard to paper, and he
                suggested that there is too much money in the purchase of paper for the State work
                to admit of a fair competition amongst bidders on the part of weak printing
                houses.</p>
              <p>Mr. Johnson favored the majority bill because of its brevity, perspicuity and the
                certainty of a just construction. Combinations between printing houses were the
                occasions of fraud. There was no reason to suspect fraud on the part of printing
                houses in particular, but where the number of bidders is restricted, there is
                facility for combinations. He could not see why the minority bill should create
                again what is equivalent to a public printer.</p>
              <p>And then on motion of Mr. Walker, the minority bill was laid on the table by yeas
                52, nays 37.</p>
              <pb n="218" xml:id="VAA8558-14-218"/>
              <p>The question recurring on concurrence in the majority report, it was decided in the
                affirmative.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Cauthorn, there were added to section three these words: "Which
                power of revocation shall be inserted in the contract."</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Eward, there were added to section two these words: "And all
                persons authorized to have or receive any printing or binding at the expense of the
                State, shall make a written requisition therefor to the Board of Public
                Printing."</p>
              <p>Mr. Shirley moved ineffectually to amend further by striking out the word
                "Governor"which was laid on the table - yeas 66, nays 20.</p>
              <p>On motion of Ms. Branham the bill was further amended (clerically) by striking out
                from the first line of section 5 these words: "have power to."</p>
              <p>Mr. Walker moved for the suspension of the Constitutional restriction(in which Mr.
                Woollen acquiesced)which was agreed to; and so the bill was read the third time, as
                amended, and finally passed the House of Representatives - yeas 55, nays 24.</p>

              <p>Mr. Mellett submitted a preamble and resolution, reciting that an order of the last
                session which imposed on the Clerk of the House of Representatives the duty of
                making two journals, thereby imposing double clerical duty, and that former
                Legislatures have allowed extra compensation for extra clerical service; and,
                therefore, ordering that the Principal and Principal Assistant Clerks be each
                allowed $3 a day additional to their present per diem, and that their employes be
                each allowed $2 a day extra; but it was subsequently withdrawn for a motion by Mr.
                Branham, by which the bill [S. 168] supplemental to the act in relation to the
                organization of the two Houses of the General Assembly, prescribing the number of
                employes in each House, prescribing their duties and declaring an emergency, was
                taken up, with the committee amendments thereto reported. [The bill, as amended,
                increases the per diem of the principal and assistant clerks, and the reading clerk
                of the House to $8 a day; and provides that the Committee on Ways and Means, the

              <p>Mr. Mellett proposed to amend further by adding a clause to increase the pay of the
                employees of the principal and principal assistant clerks two dollars a day from the
                commencement of the present session.</p>

                bill [S. 273] relating to the construction of railroads, with an amendment, striking
                out from the enacting clause and inserting new matter, which, on motion of Mr.
                Dwiggins, was considered as the second reading of the bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough, from the <orgName>Committee on Claims</orgName>, reported favorably on
                several claims, a dozen or so, in the Burson contested election case of 1871.</p>
              <p>Mr. Daugherty, from the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName>, returned Mr.
                Slater's bill [S. 288] regulating the legal rate of interest at 8 per cent, with a
                recommendation, that it be indefinitely postponed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Slater moved to lay the report on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dittemore moved to lay both the report and bill on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Slater demanded, a division of the question.</p>
              <p>The Senate refused to lay the report on the table by yeas 3, nays 38.</p>

              <p>Mr. Scott called up the special order being the bills [H. R. 89, 369, 493, 410, 55
                and 382] referring to school matters.</p>
              <p>Mr. Armstrong, from the <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName>, returned the
                bill [H. R. 87] to amend the common school law of March 6, 1865, adding supplemental
                sections with amendments, striking out the word "July," and inserting in lieu the
                word ''April."</p>
              <p>Mr. Glessner, from the same committee, returned the bill [H. R. 382] to fix the
                salary of Superintendent of Public Instruction at $2,000, with a favorable
                report.</p>
              <p>Also the bill [H. R. 410] to amend the act authorizing township trustees of towns
                and cities to levy a tax for school purposes with a favorable recommendation.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough, from the same committee, returned the bill [H. R. 55] to amend the
                common school law of March 6,1865, and adding supplemental sections, with a
                recommendation that it pass.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott, from the same committee, returned the bill [H. R. 360] to appropriate
                $150 for the distribution of the report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction,
                with a similar report.</p>
              <p>Also the bill [H. R. 493] to amend section 8 of the township business act of
                February 18, 1859, with a similar report.</p>
              <p>These reports were severally concurred in.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott moved that the constitutional restrictions be dispensed with; that these
                bills be severally read the second time by title only, then by sections for the
                third reading, and put upon their passage.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dittemore, Mr. Brown and others objecting, the former entering his solemn
                protest against this summary way of disposing of important bills.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott withdrew his motion.</p>
              <p>The bill [H. R. 87] to amend the common school law of March 6, 1865, and adding
                supplemental sections, being read the second time,</p>
              <p>Cave moved to amend by substituting"September" for "October" in section - .</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott opposed making any material changes in the bill for fear of losing the
                whole thing.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins opposed the amendment, the object of the bill being to have the old
                trustees make settlement and the new trustees qualify at the October session of the
                Board of Commissioners.</p>
              <p>Mr. Cave desired these settlements or reports to be received at the September term
                instead of calling the board together in October for that special purpose.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott thought the only difficulty about the amendment is that it would require
                a settlement about six weeks before the terms of offices of these trustees
                expire.</p>
              <p>The amendment was rejected by yeas 12, nays 30.The bill was thus passed to the
                third reading.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gooding moved that a dispensation of the constitutional rules that the bill may
                be passed to the final vote.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Dwiggins the motion was laid on the table.</p>
              <p>The bill [H. R. 360] to appropriate $150 for the distribution of the report of the
                Superintendent of Public Institution was read the second time, and passed to the
                third reading.</p>
              <p>The bill [H. R. 493] to amend section eight of the act of February 18, 1859, to
                provide for a more uniform mode of doing township busines, was read the second time
                and passed to the third reading.</p>
              <p>The bill [H. R. 410] to amend the act of March 9, 1867, authorizing school trustees
                of civil townships and towns and cities to levy taxes for school purposes, was read
                the second time and passed to the third reading.</p>
              <p>The bill [H. R. 55] to amend the common school act of March 6, 1865, and adding
                supplemental sections thereto, was read the second time. It proposes to substitute a
                county superintendent for the county examiner, and enlarge the duties of said
                officer.</p>
              <p>Mr. Fuller moved to amend section 6 by inserting after the word "shall," the words,
                "when ordered by the County Commissioners"shall examine the county records.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott thought the amendment a very plausible one, but it would almost destroy
                the usefulness of the County Superintendent.</p>
              <p>The amendment was agreed to upon a division of the Senate.</p>
              <p>Mr. Orr moved to amend section 9 by striking out the last clause of the section,
                which is in these words, "or forfeit one day's wages for each day's absence
                therefrom." [The Teachers' Institute.]</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott thought there was no danger in leaving this clause in.</p>
              <p>The amendment was rejected by a rising vote.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins regarded this as a radical change in the law, and he moved that the
                bill lie on the table, and 100 copies of the bill be printed.</p>
              <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
              <p>The bill [H. R. 382] relative to the salary of the Superintendent of Public
                Instruction - it shall be $2,000 - was read the second time and passed to the third
                reading.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott moved to dispense with the constitutional restriction, that all these
                House bills may be read the third time to-day and severally put upon their
                passage.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown raised the point of order that such a motion can not be made.</p>
              <p>The Lieutenant Governor sustained the points of order.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott then moved for a dispensation that the bill read may be put upon its
                passage now, pending which the Senate took a recess till two o'clock. </p>

            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
            <p>Mr. Scott offered a resolution, which was adopted, allowing the Secretary to employ
              two additional clerks.</p>
            <p>Mr. Fuller introduced a joint resolution [S. 15] Instructing and requesting Indiana
              Congressmen to use their influence to secure the passage of a law extending the time
              for the filing of applications for pensions by disabled soldiers.</p>
            <p>It was passed the Senate by yeas 85, nays 0.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thompson, from the <orgName>Committee on Benevolent Institutions</orgName>,
              returned the bill [S. 333] for the relief of indigent cripples, with a recommendation
              that it pass.</p>
            <p>Mr. Rhodes, from the <orgName>Committee on Fees and Salaries</orgName>, returned the
              bill [H. R. 330] supplemental to the act fixing the per diem and mileage of members of
              the General Assembly, with an amendment striking out the second section - being the
              emergency clause.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown suggested that such a law would not be binding on any subsequent
              Legislature, and he would like to see it lay on the table. It is a waste of time to
              enact a law that can be repealed in a day by any future Legislature.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wadge suggested that this bill might cut off the Brevier Reports, just being
              distributed on the desks of members, the acts, journals and other books.</p>
            <p>Several members. Strike out the wrord "books."</p>
            <p>A Senator. If that bill passes it will exclude members from receiving any Brevier
              Reports.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown moved to lay the bill on the table.</p>
            <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas 23, nay 15.</p>
            <p>Mr. Scott renewed his motion for a dispensation of the Constitutional rule so that
              the bill [H. R. 382] relative to the salary of the Superintendent of Public
              instruction may be put on its passage now.</p>
            <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas, 37; nays, 5.</p>
            <p>The bill was read the third time and passed by yeas, 27; nays, 13.</p>
            <p>On the further motion by Mr. Scott, the Constitutional restriction was further
              suspended - yeas, 39; nays, 3 - and the bill [H. R. 360] appropriating $150 for the
              distribution of the reports of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, was read the
              third time and passed the Senate by yeas, 32; nays, 7.</p>
            <p>Mr. Scott moved for a further dispensation that the bill [H. R. 410] to amend the law
              so as compel school trustees to levy a tax of 25 cents on the $100, in order that a
              school may be kept up for six months in the year in each township might be pressed to
              the final vote.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cave believed this bill would compel a tax of 25 cents in addition to the 16 per
              cent, now authorized by law, which would make a tax of 41 cents.</p>
            <p>Mr. Slater was in favor of voting every dollar for common school purposes that the
              people will ask. H&gt; hoped the bill would pass.</p>
            <p>Mr. Williams suggested Constitutional difficulty - here must be a school system alike
              in all the counties of the State.</p>
            <p>Mr. Rhodes said the present law allows Township Trustees to levy a school fund not to
              exceed twenty per cent on the $100, and this bill proposes to make it imperative on
              the Township Trustees to levy such a tax, which added to the money he receives from
              other sources, will keep the school open six months. The trouble now is that some
              trustees levy no tax at all, and the result is that the school terms are now irregular
              in the several townships in the State.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gooding hoped the motion would prevail, and that the bill may be passed.</p>
            <p>The motion to suspend the constitutional rule was rejected by yeas 30, nays 10 -
              two-thirds not voting in the affirmative.</p>
            <p>On motion by Mr. Scott, this bill was made the special order for Monday at two
              o'clock P. M.</p>
            <p>On motion by Mr. Brown, the bill [H. R. 87] was made the special order for two
              o'clock P. M.</p>
            <p>Mr. Scott moved for a further dispensation that the bill [H. R. 493] changing the
              time of settlement of Township Trustees from March to June, may be passed to the final
              vote now.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cave hoped the motion would carry, as it was very necessary this bill should be
              passed.</p>
            <p>The motion to dispense with the constitutional restriction was agreed to by yeas 39,
              nays 4.</p>
            <p>The bill [H. R. 493] to amend section 8 of the act regulating township business,
              approved February 18, 1859, was read the third time and finally passed by yeas 41,
              nays 0.</p>
            <div type="section">
              <head rend="center">FEES AND SALARIES.</head>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Rhodes the fee and salary bill [S. 292] was read the third
                time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams asked and failed to obtain unanimous consent to amend section 19 so
                that when constables shall call any one to their assistance, the assistants shall be
                paid the same fee as the officer.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown regarded it as impracticable to allow this power to constables who may be
                timid and may desire to put fees in the pockets of some friends or bystanders.</p>
              <p>Mr. Williams asked but failed to obtain unanimous consent to amend section 10 by
                providing that the fee for recording a deed or mortgage shall include the
                certificate accompanying.</p>
              <p>The bill passed the Senate by yeas 29, nays 14 as follows:</p>

              <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
              <p>Mr. Fuller, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said that this
                bill would create the highest salaries ever known in this State. In the county of
                Marion he believed some officers would make $30,000 a year. This is a much higher
                fee bill than the one passed two years ago, and he voted for it under protest only,
                because the present law is differently construed by different county officers, and
                because the people are demanding a change, and this is the only chance the present
                session.</p>
              <p>Mr. Neff, in explanation of his vole, when his name was called, said he was a
                member of that joint Committee on Fees and Salaries which had reported this bill as
                a compromise, but since then it has been so changed by amendments, he could not vote
                for it. He had compared this bill with the fee and salary acts since 1855, and was
                constrained to say with the Senator from Warrick (Mr. Fuller) that we never have had
                so objectionable a fee bill on the statute book as this would be, and that the
                highest fees ever known in our State will be paid by this fee bill should it become
                a law. Having satisfied himself of this, he was compelled to vote "no."</p>
              <p>Mr. Orr and Mr. Thompson voted "aye" under protest.</p>
              <p>Mr. Friedley, of Scott, desiring his name to be called said he was not satified
                with the bill, but his people want a change from the present law, and if this bill
                were not passed there would be no change for two years to come, consequently, he
                felt compelled to vote "aye" under protest.</p>
              <p>Mr. Gooding, directing his name to be called, said in explanation that this bill
                didn't suit him, but as his people were clamorous for a change from the present law
                be would vote "aye."</p>
              <p>Mr. Boone, asking that his name be called, said he thought part of the bill right
                and part of it not right, but as there seems to be two fee bills now in Indiana, one
                in force in one county and another in another, in order to get the thing <pb n="222"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-14-222"/> regulated so that there may be uniformity throughout the
                State, he would vote aye.</p>
              <p>The result was then announced as above recorded.</p>
              <p>So the bill passed the Senate.</p>
              <p>On motion by Mr. Scott, the title was amended by adding "and providing duties to be

            <head rend="center">THE REVENUE BILL.</head>
            <p>The Speaker announced the special order for the consideration of the Revenue bill in
              Committee of the Whole House: Whereupon - </p>
            <p>The House, as a <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName> (Nr. Richardson in the
              Chair) took up the bill [H. R. 530] to raise revenue for State purposes for it, yeas
              73 and 74, and the Chairman directed and the Clerk read the bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kimball set forth the provisions of the bill, its results under them, and the
              necessity for them; and moved that the committee rise and report the bill to the House
              without amendment and recommend its passage.</p>
            <p>In the debate which followed, Mr. Thayer considered that the valuations of taxable
              property under the new assessment act ought to justify the promises of gentlemen that
              the levy need not be increased.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kimball and Mr. Branham submitted the committee's estimates that the new law for
              valuation would not be sufficient, and that the levy proposed would be no more than
              will be necessary. The estimated total valuation of the State being $800,000,000, it
              would give a revenue of $1,600,000.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thompson, of Elkhart, proposed to amend the bill by striking out "twenty" and
              inserting "fifteen" for the per cent. of the levy for 1873.</p>
            <p>Mr. Millett gave considerations against the amendment.</p>
            <p>Mr. Givan supposed the committee to have put the lowest estimate on the expenses of
              the State; he supposed the total of the State's duplicate would be nearer ten hundred
              millions than eight hundred millions. He was opposed to raising revenue to be idle on
              the Treasury. </p>
            <p>Mr. Kimball showed, in accordance with the opinion of the committee, and the State
              officers whom they consulted, that it is better to base the levy on a certain
              estimate, than to place it on an uncertain estimate. We are now compelled to make a
              temporary loan, and he desired that such a necessity should not follow y oar after
              year.</p>
            <p>Mr. McConnell said there is not enough difference between the requirements for
              valuation in the old and the new assessment laws to justify the expectations of a
              largely increased revenue</p>
            <p>Mr. Cobb commended the policy of the State as of the individual: Pay as you go. It is
              better to have a little surplus than to be running the State into debt.</p>
            <p>Mr. Branham called attention to the fact that the time of the assessments is charged
              from the first of January to the first of April - which is in the interests of the
              farmers. He was satisfied that the increase of the valuation of real estate would not
              justify the estimates of gentlemen. The actual needs of 1873 will reach $1,600,000,
              and this levy would probably bring in $1,300,000. A safe levy would give the State
              better credit in the market where she has to go for the present proposed loan. His
              original opposition to so high a levy has been overcome by the figures he was obliged
              to face, and which he presented to the <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName>.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thayer. If he could go home with the conviction that there will be nothing gained
              to the revenue by the valuation now required for real estate, he could vote for their
              proposed levy. But his understanding was that the assessments would be upon a
              valuation of real estate and others taxable, increased by two and a half per cent. He
              proposed to amend the amendment by making it ten per cent. for 1874.</p>
            <p>Mr. Buttwworth. It was the understanding in <pb n="223" xml:id="VAA8558-14-223"/> his
              part of the State that real property would be assessed at its fair value; and this
              would repress the excuses of heavy stock owners for prevarications.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lenfestey considered that the new assessment law would increase the value of the
              mineral lands more than a hundred millions; and a large increase of revenue was
              expected to result from the taxation of railroads.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kimball. If we strike this levy down, may not the people ask why we do not
              increase the levy instead of paying ten per cent, on loan of seven or eight hundred
              thousand dollars?</p>
            <p> Mr. Thompson, of Elkhart. During the war times we never had a more extravagant
              levy.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kimball. We had then forty-five per cent.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thompson. Better to cut off heavy appropriations than to make a burdensome
              increase of the levy. He proposed to make the levy accord with the assessments.</p>
            <p>Mr. Johnson. Taking the committee's statements of the necessities and resources of
              the State, it is wisdom in the Legislature to take the responsibility involved. The
              Buncomb reducduction of the levy two years ago to five cents brought no credit to its
              inventors.</p>
            <p>Mr. Stanley. The Garret bonds were not in the estimates at that time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brett. We know the past levy has not been sufficient. He summed the current
              expenses, and argued thence the necessity of increased taxation. This shuffling
              responsibility by way of loans was the worst of resorts. We might reduce the levy to
              ten cents for 1874, but less than twenty cents for 1873 would leave the Treasury in a
              depleted condition. Certainly under fifteen cents for each of these years would not
              meet the wants of the State. He was opposed to the loan of a million; and preferred a
              just and and square taxation at once.</p>
            <p>Mr. Thayer's and Mr. Thompson's amendments were successively rejected; also Mr.
              Blocher's amendment, to make the levy at ten cents instead of fifteen for 1874.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kimball's motion was then agreed to, and, accordingly, the committee rose and the
              chairman reported the bill to the House without amendment, with the recommendation of
              the committee of the whole House that the same do pass.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Branham, the further consideration of the bill was postponed, and it
              was made the special order for Tuesday morning at ten o'clock, in the hope (as he
              said,) that the committee having time to do so might revise their figures and propose
              a low or levy.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wilson, of Ripley, moved ineffectually to take up the Carnahan bill [S. 71]

            <p>On motion of Mr. Dittemore, the reports from the special committee on the bill S. 290
              were read. The majority of the committee recommend amendments to to the bill [S. 290],
              suspending the active operations of the act providing a Female Reformatory Institute,
              and changes its uses to the care and comfort and treatment of the insane of the State.

              companies to use public highways, etc. In asking for leave to submit this bill - </p>
            <p>Mr. Oliver said: The bill handed me for introduction simply extends section fifteen
              of the general railroad law to street railway companies that is, where a street
              railway company desires to extend its line beyond the corporate limits, and can not,
              by compromise with the land owner, obtain the right of way. Such company may proceed,
              under the same section, to condemn the land, assess and pay the damage, and then
              secure the right of way, as railway companies generally may do.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Hough, his bill [S. 34] to amend sections ninety and one hundred and

              companies was made the special order for four o'clock today.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gregg introduced a joint resolution [S. 16] in relation to railroad corporations,

            <p>President Friedley took the chair at 2 P. M.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Brown, the bill [H. R. 36] to amend the charter of the Franklin
              Insurance Company was taken up, and he moved to reconsider the vote adopting an
              amendment reserving the right of the Legislature to exercise control over the length
              of time the charter may run.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gooding and Mr. Brown insisted that the amendment was very unjust, and would in a
              great measure destroy the usefulness of the company.</p>
            <p>Mr Hubbard believed if any enlargement of this charter is made, the General Assembly
              should hold the reins, and not forever put it out of the power of the people of the
              State to control these corporations in the future.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown explained that this bill simply changes the name of this company, asks that
              stockholders shall vote as in other corporations, and provides for an extension of
              time-perpetual. Mr. Scott objected to the amendment.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dwiggins doubted the propriety of authorizing the organization of a corporation
              and then allowing the legislature to repeal the entire charter.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hubbard believed it better for the people, to keep all corporations within the
              power of the people's representatives,as in England the power of Parliament over all
              corporations is unlimited.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hall made an ineffectual motion to lay on the table the motion to reconsider. The
              motion to reconsider was agreed to by yeas 29, nays 11.</p>
            <p>On motion by Mr. Brown the amendment was laid on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hall moved to strike out the word perpetual.</p>
            <p>On motion by Mr. Brown - yeas 32, nays 9 - the bill was read the third time.</p>
            <p>The bill [H. R. 36] to amend sections 1 and 6 of the act of February 13, 1851, to
              incorporate the Franklin Insurance Company, was then passed the Senate by yeas 30,

              <p>The bill [H. R. 25] to amend the School Law of March 6, 1865, being the special
                order, was now called up.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved to amend section two, by making the first meeting of the
                township trustees to elect a county superintendent in "1874" instead of "1873," and
                bi-ennially" thereafter, instead of "tri-ennially."</p>
              <p>Mr. Steel moved to lay the amendment on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins demanded a division of the question. The Senate refused to lay the
                first clause of the amendment on the table, yeas 18, nays 21.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins obtained leave to withdraw that part of his amendment.</p>
              <p>The Senate refused to lay on the table the second clause of the amendment.</p>
              <p>The amendment striking out "tri-ennially" and substituting "bi-nnially" in lieu,
                was agreed to.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved to further amend by striking out the words "and an experienced
                and successful teacher" where they refer to the qualification of the County
                Superintendent.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott doubted the expediency of this amendment.</p>
              <p>Mr. Rosebrough, Mr. Harney, Mr. Dwiggins and Mr. Brown favored the amendment.
                Agreed to.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved to amend section four by striking out the words "and as much
                oftener as he may deem it necessary" he shall visit each school in the county -
                agreed to.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved to further amend section 4 by providing that nothing in this act
                shall abridge legal rights in cases arising in the courts under the school law.</p>
              <p>It was agreed to.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins moved to amend section 9 by adding thereto "unless such absence [from
                the Teachers' Institute] shall be occasioned by sickness."Mr. Rosebrough moved to
                amend action 2 by investing the election or appointment of County Examiners in the
                Board of Commissioners instead of Township Trustees.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott hoped the Senate would not make this change. The township trustees are
                more directly from the people, and more interested in this matter.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins also opposed the amendment, for the township trustees now employ
                teachers, and are well acquainted with the wants of their several neighborhoods.</p>
              <p>The amendment was rejected by yeas 18, nays 22.Mr. Scott moved to add to section 2
                a provision that whenever a vacancy occurs the trustees must assemble and fill the
                vacancy. The Auditor to give the casting vote in case of a tie, and keep a
                record.</p>
              <p>It was agreed to.</p>
              <p>The bill was then read the third time and passed the Senate by yeas 26, nays 15. An
                amendment being made by Mr. Dwiggins, by consent, that the County Examiners shall
                continue to discharge their duties till the County Superintendents be elected and
                qualified.</p>
              <p>The bill [H. R. 410] to amend the act of March 9, 1867, authorizing and directing
                trustees to levy a school tax, not to exceed 25 per cent., so as to maintain the
                common schools six months In every year - being part of the special order for this
                afternoon - was read the third time and failed to pass - yeas 22 nays 19two-thirds
                not voting in the affirmative.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins and Mr. Howard explaining their negative votethe tax will bear more
                heavily on the weaker counties under this bill.</p>
              <p>The bill [H. R. 87] to amend the common school law of March 6, 1865, and adding

                to the special order for this afternoon - was read the third time.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough asked and obtained unanimous consent to amend section eleven by allowing
                $5 per day and five cents mileage, so as to make it correspond with a bill
                heretofore reported.</p>
              <p>Mr. Haworth moved ineffectually for unanimous consent to amend section twenty-nine
                so that the people of the district may choose the teacher.</p>
              <p>Mr. Friedley, of Scott, asked but failed to obtain consent to amend so the school
                term shall commence the first Monday in September instead of July, as the bill
                reads.</p>
              <p>The bill finally passed by yeas 26, nays 16.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dittemore called up the special order, being reports from the Special Committee
                on the bill [S. 290] in relation to converting the Women and Girls' Reformatory into
                a Hospital for the Insane - the question being on the minority report against the
                proposed change, submitted just before the recess for dinner, by Mr. Thompson.</p>
              <p>It was laid on the table, on motion by Mr. Dittemore.</p>
              <p>Mr. Thompson spoke against the passage of the bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dittemore supported the proposition of the committee, believing that it would
                only require an additional appropriation of $8,000 to put the building in order for
                the reception of the insane.</p>
              <p>Mr. Harney stated that this building has been standing for two years unused; it is
                plastered, heating apparatus is there, the gas pipes are in, and it is in easy reach
                of water work pipes. The only question is which claims are the most pressing, the
                insane or a class needing a reformatory institution. As a temporary measure, he
                favored the report of the committee.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hall said the result of the passage of this bill would be to deprive the insane
                of what really should be done for them. Instead of providing for two hundred, as
                this temporary plan would, there should be provision made for fifteen hundred.</p>
              <p>The report of the majority was concurred in by yeas 37, nays 6, and the amendment
                was ordered to be engrossed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, moved that the constitutional restriction be dispensed
                with, that the bill may be put on its passage now.</p>
              <p>The motion was agreed toyeas 38, nays 4the bill read the third time and passed the
                Senate by yeas 36, nays 6.Mr. Smith suggested that the salaries of the officials of
                this institution should be set out in the bill.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Collett, his bill [S. 273] in relation to the construction of
                railroads was read the third time, Mr. C. explaining that its intention is to apply
                only to two short roads in his part of the State.</p>
              <p>Mr. Carnahan opposed the passage of the bill, fearing it may effect other cases
                than the ones intended. He was tired of these kind of railroad bills. He moved this
                one be indefinitely postponed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Collett said there could be no injustice in requiring people to comply with the
                bargains they may make in exact terms; and that is the main principle running
                through this bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown was satisfied this bill would not affect the roads of this State
                injuriously.</p>
              <p>Mr. Smith insisted that a minority opposing railroad taxes in any shape, should not
                be cutoff from their day in court.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hubbard believed this bill would effect a case now in the St, Joseph Court, and
                thought the minority should have the right to make a defense material.</p>
              <p>The passage of the bill was also opposed by Mr. Rhodes and Mr. Dwiggins.</p>

              desks, &amp;c., used by the several committees of the Senate, at ten o'clock A. M., on
              Monday next. On motion by Mr. Taylor the resolution was amended so that the proceeds
              shall be paid in the State Treasury. The resolution as amended was adopted. The
              Lieutenant Governor announced the consideration of the special order, being Mr.
              Wadge's bill [S. 293] supplemental to the act of February 21, 1855, providing for the
              election of an Attorney General, and prescribing additional duties for County Clerks
              and Prosecuting Attorneys. It was read the second time. Mr. Steele moved a substitute
              for section 15, which will allow the Attorney General such clerks as the Governor,
              Auditor and Secretary of State may deem proper, &amp;c., instead of leaving it to his
              discretion how many may be employed by him. Mr. Daggy preferred the wording as in the
              bill, with an amendment to section 17, that in no case shall the Attorney General's
              fees, perquisites and emoluments exceed ten thousand dollars a year, the excess to be
              paid in the treasury. Mr. Smith moved to amend the amendment by striking out all
              except what refers to the salary The bill has the appearance of an effort to make the
              Attorney General the great tycoon of the State. It was laid on the table on a division
              of 49 to 17. The Senate refused to lay the amendment [Mr. Steele's] on the table by

              was seconded by the Senate.</p>

              of the Attorney General to $10,000 a year for clerk or deputy hire, which shall be
              paid out of the funds collected. Mr. Gooding made an ineffectual motion to lay it on
              the table. It was agreed to, and the bill was ordered to be engrossed. Mr. Wadge moved
              to dispense with the constitutional restriction, that the bill may be pressed to the
              final vote at once.</p>
            <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas 39, nays 5. The bill was read the third time and

              <p>On motion of Mr. Kimball, the committee bill [H. R. 530] to raise revenue for State
                purposes for the years 1873 and 1874 (fifteen cents on the $100 and fifty cents
                poll) was taken up, the question being on the third reading. A call of the House,
                demanded by Mr. Cauthorn, determined seventy-nine members present. The bill was
                finally passed the House of Representatives - yeas 63, nays 27. The Speaker. The
                question raised yesterday was in regard to a motion to reconsider the vote passing
                the Senate Court bill, No. 238, which was passed by the House, with amendments. The
                motion to reconsider was made in time. The usual course in such cases is to send a
                message to that body requesting the return of the bill; and upon the general rule it
                is not competent to proceed upon any paper till it is in the possession of the
                House. Mr. Cauthorn and Mr. Gregory appealed in writing from the decision of the
                chair to the judgment of the House. After debate by Messrs. Walker, Cauthorn and
                Ogden, the decision of the chair was sustained by the House <pb n="239"

                to reconsider on the table. Mr. Cauthorn seconded the motion. Mr. Ogden appealed
                warmly against the motion, denouncing the course of the friends of the bill. Mr.
                Cauthorn insisted on the motion and adhered to his second. Mr. Ogden directed a
                personal denunciation against Mr. C., as the veriest pug amongst them; whereupon Mr.
                C. made a demonstration with a pamphlet over the benches, and many members near
                interposed and prevented a collision. Mr. Kimball moved ineffectually for a recess
                of one hour, to let the blood have its course of regulation; yeas 7, nays 83. The
                question recurring on the motion of Mr. Woollen to lay the motion to reconsider the

                Supreme Court to keep a cash book, in which he shall note the docket fees
                specifically, with particular mention of each case before the court, which shall be
                kept for inspection. On motion of Mr. Wilson of Ripley, it was laid on the table.

                to amend section five, giving the county treasurer five per cent on the first
                $25,000, instead of $20,000; also giving him constable's fees in certain cases, and
                paying him for coming to Indianapolis to make his annual report, (for the benefit of

                and $3, and insert five cents and $5, which were severally laid on the table. On
                motion of Mr. Givan the section was amended by striking out "official," so as to
                leave it - for taking and approving all bonds. Mr. Thayer proposed - as to the
                sheriff fees$5 instead of $3. Mr. Lenfesty proposed to amend section 8: for holding
                court, $3 per day - serving notice on viewers of highways, 25 cents and millage;
                which were laid on the table. Mr. Wesner proposed to amend section 8,striking out
                and inserting: selling property on execution, a commission of 5 per cent on the
                first $300; 2 per cent on all sums in excess of that; rejected. Mr. Thayer proposed

                lawful for the county commissioners to make each or either of such officers an

                principal, of which he shall report under oath, penalty not exceeding $500 and

                on the motion to reconsider. Mr. Walker showed that the section, however correct in
                the abstract, is out of place, and would be fatal to this bill, and the vote was
                then reconsidered. On motion of Mr. Mellett, the section was then laid on the table
                - yeas 63, nays 24. Mr. Thayer proposed, ineffectually, to amend section 6 by
                striking out the words "receipts for road taxes and assessor's returns.'Mr. Reed
                moved ineffectually to amend sec. 4, inserting, "and for every such certificate

                applicant." Mr. Wynn demanded the previous question, and there was a second and the
                main question: shall the bill be read the third time now? was decided in the

                claim of Edwin May for architectural services on the Northern prison, $5,000,
                without recommendation. On motion of Mr. Butterworth, it was laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Shutt returned the claim of Anthony Davis, janitor, $40allowed. Also the claim
                of Patrick Shannon, for services and office rent as Agent of State, $5,000,
                recommending that it be not allowed. Mr. Kimball proposed to reduce the claim to
                $2,500; which was laid on the table. The question recurring on the concurring in the
                report of the committee, that the claim be not allowed, it was decided in the
                affirmative - yeas, 51; nays, 27. Mr. Lenfesty returned the claim of the
                Indianapolis Sentinel Company, for papers furnished the General Assembly, without
                order, $260, without recommendation; which was laid on the table. Also the claim of
                the Indianapolis Journal Company for papers furnished the General Assembly in the
                same way, $159, without recommendation, which was also laid on the table. Also the
                claim of Lester L. Norton, for sixty days services as <orgName>Judiciary
                  Committee</orgName> Janitor, also without recommendation. After debate by Messrs.
                Woollen, Walker, Kimball, Smith, Peed and others, Mr. Brett proposed to make the
                allowance $3 a day. Mr. Mellett proposed a gross allowance of $100. Mr. Peed moved
                to lay the whole matter on the table, which was decided in the negative - yeas 21,
                nays 61and the question recurred on Mr. Mellett's motion, which was agreed to. On
                motion of Mr. Branham, the claim of John Maloney, janitor, for $67 50, was taken up
                and allowed. Mr. King moved to reconsider the vote by which the House disallowed the
                claim of N. B. Taylor for legal services rendered in a contract with the
                State$1,500. Mr. Walker moved that the motion to reconsider lay on the table - yeas
                46, nays 41and then Mr. King obtained leave to withdraw the claim. Mr. Brett, from
                the <orgName>Committee on Public Buildings</orgName>, reported a recommendation
                for'an appropriation of $1,500, to be expended under the direction of the Secretary
                of State, for the protection of the outer walls of the Capitol building, which was

              <head rend="center">APPROPRIATSONS.</head>
              <p>Mr. Kimball, from the <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>, returned the
                specific bill with amendments, which were adopted. On motion by Mr. Brett, the bill
                was further amended by adding the foregoing appropriation of $1,500 for repairs of
                the outer walls of the State House, to be expended under the supervision of the
                Secretary of the State. There being some irregularity in these proceedings, the bill
                was subsequently read again, and on motion of Mr. Brett, it was amended by adding a
                provision, that the Auditor, Secretary and Treasurer shall be allowed to draw on
                these appropriations for contingencies only, upon vouchers filed with the Auditor of
                State, which vouchers shall show that the money has been earned in the service of
                the State, which was adopted by unanimous consent, and then the bill was finally
                passed the House; yeas 66, nays 19. The bill as amended was then read the third time
                by the Clerk. Mr. Cauthorn obtained leave to withdraw the claim of Patrick Shannon.
                The specific bill [H. R. 535] as amended was then finally passed the House of
                Representatives by yeas 60, nays 29. Mr. Kimball, from the <orgName>Committee on
                  Ways and Means</orgName>, returned the general appropriation bill [H. R. 531] with
                amendments, under the order of the House, and as proposed to be amended,
                recommending its passage. It was finally passed the House of Representatives by yeas
                64, nays 24.</p>
              <p>Mr. Branham from the <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>, returned the
                bill [S. 294] with ail amendment striking out, the third section, and so amended,
                recommending its passage; and on his further motion, the matter was made the special

              <head rend="center">GRAND JURIES.</head>
              <p>The Speaker took up the special order, viz., the consideration of Mr. Woolen's
                bill, [H. R. 503] regulating the convening and adjournment or grand juries, (at the
                discretion of the judges, provided that there shall be at least one grand jury
                convened in each county once a year) the question being on the third reading. Mr.
                Ogden proposed to amend by requiring the judge to convene a grand jury not less than
                twice in each year. Mr. Woollen showed that the objection to the bill was obviated
                by the next bill - Mr. Shirley's bill, [H.R. 476]requiring the prosecutors to
                prosecute before a justice of the peace on affidavit and information of the
                Prosecuting Attorney. Mr. Shirley and Mr. Mellett also opposed the amendment, and
                Mr. Ogden and Mr. Offutt supported it. Mr. Walker also opposed the amendment and
                supported the bill - the argument taking that direction. The Speaker decided that
                the object of the motion to amend could be attained at this stage of the bill only
                by recommitment with instructions to amend. Mr. Ogden modified his motion
                accordingly, and proceeded to address the House against the passage of the bill - as
                giving unsafe powers to the Judiciary on the plea of economy. On motion of Mr.
                Tulley, the motion to reconsider was laid on the table - yeas 64, nays 25. Mr.
                Gronendyke moved ineffectually to amend by striking out and providing that the grand
                jury shall not be convened more than four times in each year, and that the grand
                jury shall not sit more than ten days at each term of the court. The bill was then
                finally passed the House of Representatives - yeas 69, nays 1</p>

              <p>The Speaker took up the special order, viz.: the consideration of Mr. Shirley's
                bill [H. R. 476] relating to prosecutions by affidavit and information, the question
                being on the third reading. The bill finally passed the House of Representatives -

              <p>The bill [S. 106] to prescribe the qualifications of petit jurors in the several
                courts of this State, came up in order on the third reading. (It is to suppress
                professional jurors.) It was finally passed the House of Representatives - yeas 72,
                nays 9. Mr. Woollen's bill [H. R. 256] to regulate the order of business in the
                Circuit and Common Pleas Courts of the State, to authorize the judges to make orders
                for forming issues, and to regulate the order of probate, civil and criminal
                business, was taken up in order on the third reading. Mr. Gronendyke desired to
                strike out "Common Pleas," and insert "Justices of the Peace" in lieu: but withdrew
                the motion to recommit for that purpose. The bill was then finally passed the House
                of Representatives - yeas 77, nays 3with an amendment of title proposed by Mr.
                Woollen, so as to read: "A bill in relation to the order of business in the Circuit
                Courts, and giving the judges power to empanel special juries." Mr. Kimball
                submitted a resolution that three copies of the acts and journals of the House of
                the special and regular session of this General Assembly, be bound in library style
                for the use of each member and officer of the House of Repre- <pb n="241"

                appropriately these words: "and one copy of the Brevier Reports."</p>
              <p>Mr. Ogden said: Mr. Speaker, It becomes my sad and painful duty to announce the
                death of William T. Lockhart, the doorkeeper of this House. He died last night of
                that terrible malady, small-pox, in one of the hospitals of this city. Among the
                many things worthy of mention at this time, is the unanimity with which Mr. Lockhart
                was nominated for doorkeeper at the last Session of the General Assembly by the
                Republican members of this House; and the fact that the same high compliment was
                repeated by his re-election at the commencement of the present session. I presume
                there is not a member of the House who has not been impressed with the kindly and
                generous spirit of this young man as he went about performing his duties here. Mr.
                Lockhart, was a resident of my county-born there I believe. I have not been
                intimately acquainted with him for the last few years, as he was temporarily a
                resident of this city, attending the university here as a student, where he would
                have completed his course of study next year.</p>
              <p>Mr. Speaker: There was another time, in other years when I was personally and
                intimately acquainted with this noble young man. It was in those trying days when
                the tocsin of war sounded through the land rallying her sons to battle - when a wall
                of living hearts sprang up around the imperiled flag at the nations summons, as the
                walls of Thebes sprang up at the sound of the lyre of Amphion - and in that living
                wall was found the warm, gallant heart of William T. Lockhart. We belonged to the
                same regiment and company. He was a mere lad then, but he performed his duties like
                a manlike the hero that he was: and when fear blanched the cheek of the bravest in
                the tempest of battle William T. Lockhart always stood fearless at the post of
                duty.</p>
              <p>In one of the terrible battles in the wilderness his arm was shattered by a rebel
                bullet and the knife of the amputator became necessary to save his life. Be was
                discharged and returned home friendless and penniless to fight the great battle of
                life with one arm, where others had two, but he fought it manfully and cheerfully. I
                have said that he would have completed his course at the university next year. I
                also understand that he was a student of theology. I know that he was a Christian.
                His service of the Master was no mere lip service; neither could any say that he
                "sought the chief seats in the synagogue or made long prayers on the corners of the
                streets to be heard of men." Had he lived to maturer years I have no doubt his life
                would have been a benefit and a blessing to humanity. His tongue might not have been
                touched with the burning coal from the altar of oratory; but he would have been no
                "tinkling brass and sounding Cymbal," for he had the living fire of a generous,
                upright heart that scatters its benefactions on all who approach it. He lived a pure
                and blameless life, obeying ever the injunction of the greatest of our bards, who
                said: </p>
              <lg type="free">
                <l>"So live that when thy summons comes to join</l>
                <l>The innumerable caravans that moves</l>
                <l>To that mysterious realm where each shall take</l>
                <l>His abode in the silent halls of death,</l>
                <l>Thou go not like the quarry slave scourged</l>
                <l>To his dungeon; but sustained and soothed by an</l>
                <l>Unfaltering trust approach thy grave like one,</l>
                <l>Who wraps the drapery of his couch about him</l>
                <l>And lies down to pleasant dreams."</l>
              </lg>
              <p>So he lived and so he died. In conclusion I beg leave to offer the following:</p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. Miller, the bill [H. R. 534] legalizing the assessment of taxes for
              1871 in Somerset, Wabash County, was taken up under a dispensation of the
              Constitutional rule which requires that "every bill shall be read by sections on three
              several days in each House," read by title only for the second reading, and by
              sections for the third reading, and passed the Senate by yeas 37, nays none.</p>

            <p>Mr. Collett said the State Geologist has held the office for several years past at a
              sacrifice pecuniary and personal, and that the service of that office has been of
              great advantage to the State, increasing the taxables thereof and bringing large

            <p>Mr. Branham. Jefferson county is delinquent $30,000. Here is a complete list of them.
              I instanced Wayne, because she is one of the wealthiest of the counties, and full of

              general report on the condition of the State Prisons, North and South. It recommends
              an appropriation of $2,000 for the purpose of securing water facilities for the
              Northern Prison, and $3,000 for ditching; that the Chaplains salary be increased, and
              he be required to live in or near the prison, etc. It also asserts that the Southern
              Prison is unfit to keep human beings in. The Committee recommend the prompt
              abolishment of the cat and whip, and the abandonment of the Southern Prison in 1876,
              when the present contracts expire.</p>
            <p>Mr. Williams, as a minority, dissenting from the last recommendation.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wadge said it would take an expenditure of $600,000 or $700,000 to rebuild the
              Southern Prison, when, by expending $100,000 on the Northern Prison, it would afford
              equal facilities.</p>
            <p>On motion by Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, the reports were placed on file and referred
              to the next session of the General Assembly.</p>

              prisons - directing that the names of convicts be not published, as heretofore; that
              the cat be abandoned ; that convicts have clean suits of clothing every Saturday
              night; that the chaplains live at or near the prisons, and devote their entire time to
              the convicts; that the Governor appoint one person from each Congressional District,

              impossible to get the Senate bill through the House, so if any relief is afforded this

              <p>On motion by Mr. Daugherty it was laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. Scott moved to add to the committee amendments a section appropriating $500 for

              <p>It was agreed to.</p>
              <p>Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, moved to amend the committee report by restoring section

                and $15,000 for 1874 for buildings at the State University. He said there was the
                Owen cabinet of some 80,000 pieces, costing the State $20,000, that lies there in
                boxes of no use for want of room.</p>
              <p>Mr. Taylor believed the State had never appropriated more than $14,000 for building

              <p>The report of the committee was concurred in.</p>

                $1,000 each for contingent expenses of the Treasurer and Secretary of State for each
                year, 1873 and 1874. He said the late Auditor and Treasurer are willing to establish
                a good precedent by letting their claims go if the coming incumbents are not voted
                this extra allowance, but if this extra sum remains in the bill they desire to have
                similar sums appropriated to them. If those other officers didn't get it they were
                willing to go without it.</p>
              <p>Mr. Dwiggins understood that after the Auditor of State pays his Deputy hire, he
                makes about $5,000 a year.</p>
              <p>The motion to strike out the appropriations for contingent expenses of the three

                only upon vouchers, which shall show for what the money was expended, etc.</p>
              <p>The Lieutenant Governor decided it out of order.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hough moved to strike out the incidental expenses for the Superintendent of

            <p>Mr. Pfrimmer's bill [H. R. 69] making an appropriation of $413,599 48 to pay the
              claims of sufferers by the Morgan raid, was taken up in order on the third
              reading.</p>
            <p>Mr. Walker moved for the indefinite postponement of the bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. Blocher supported the bill and defended the justice of the claims of these
              sufferers - Morgan stole, and the agents of the government became aiders and abettors
              in the crime - the government realizing $180,000 for the sale of our horses.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kimball gave the reasons at length, which would induce him to vote for the bill,
              adding to Mr. Blocher's considerations and facts this: that, after Morgan and Hobson,
              came the United States quartermasters who despoiled those people of between $150,000
              and $190,000 more; and this the State of Indiana could recover of the general
              government by presenting vouchers, as he had been lately advised by General Eaton,
              whose letter was in the hands of Mr. Eward or Mr. Pfrimmer. He spoke warmly of
              patriotic worth of the people of those southern counties.</p>
            <p>Mr. North also attested to many of the facts of sufferings, and Mr. Blocher (in reply
              to Mr. Thompson's suggestion of a job in the bill) said that he was authorized to say,
              for Mr. William English, that he has not, and that he never had, a dollar in these
              claims.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lenfesty said these claims were fairly presented at Washington, and disallowed,
              because to allow them would be in derogation of the doctrine that the State never pays
              despoilments by the public enemy. The claims of the people of Kentucky, Maryland and
              Pennsylvania for losses by the rebellion, were identical with these, and equally as
              just as these.</p>

              classes. He made the point that while the Government may not pay for losses by the
              public enemy, it is not right to appropriate the money it pocketed by the sale of our
              property. It was absurd to call upon individual sufferers to prosecute their claims,
              when the average claim was, perhaps, less than $200. Such advice was simple denial of
              justice. Those citizens ask reimbursement for property taken from them and sold by
              order of the Governor. He referred for the ground of these claims to the Documentary
              Journal for 1865, page 404. etc., and the report of the Commission appointed
              thereupon. This relief has been recommended by Governor Morton, recommended by
              Governor Baker, and deliberately passed by the General Assembly, but failed by an
              untimely breaking up of the session. To call it a job is a slander, and the slander is
              worse than the wrong.</p>
            <p>Mr. Reno understood that these claims embrace the the destruction of bridges and
              railroads, etc. Such relief was unknown to legislation, and it would be unsafe as a
              precedent.</p>
            <p>Mr. Johnson desired to place himself squarely on the record against the allowance of
              any part of these claims. It was not a question of sympathy, but a question of law and
              public duty. Indiana can no more afford to allow those claims than she could repay
              every citizen who has suffered pecuniary losses by the rebellion.</p>
            <p>Mr. Branham interposed the question: Did not Ohio allow such claims? and did not the
              General Government reimburse that State?</p>
            <p>Mr. Johnson did not know. He was informed that such is the fact, but he proceeded to
              show at length that the precedent is unsafe, etc., but replied to Mr. Kimbill and Mr.
              Branham. If there is anything due to those claimants its due by the general
              Government, and that demolishes the principle on which their claims are asserted here
              - that the relief shall be paid only to sufferers, and their claims have been
              presented to the general Government and rejected. As to the question of a job, the
              jobbers in these claims are anxious for the passage of this bill, as Mr. Rollins, in
              the county of Lawrence has bought up $40,000 in these claims. William H. English's
              attorney, told in his hearing, at the noon hour, that he owned $100,000 in this
              interest. [Sensation.] Mr. Branham and Mr. Blocher denounced the affirmation that it
              is a job, as a falsehood; and Mr. English in the lobby (being invited by Mr. Johnson)
              was understood to say that Mr. Johnson is mistaken or his attorney has falsified. The
              sensation subsided with an apology in which nothing was extenuated.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wilson, of Ripley, took up his "five-minutes" parable and filled it with special
              pleading for the bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kimball replied to his colleague's allegation that Mr. English holds these claims
              to the amount of $100,000. The gentleman simply overheard the false statement at
              lunch, and retailed it here in the fall, round, eloquent terms for which he is
              distinguished. He (Kimball) himself drew that feature in the bill which cuts off all
              jobbers in these claims. He more than quintupled his "five-minutes" in his rejoinder,
              with his peculiar style of pleading, alleging the recommendation of the allowance of
              these claims by Governor Morton, Governor Baker, and in a note from Governor
              Hendricks, showed the present Executive mind to be favorably impressed with the
              reasoning for those recommendations.</p>
            <p>Mr. Johnson submitted a personal statement, to wit: He said that the attorney to whom
              he referred is not now the attorney for Mr. English, and declined to fire on the mere
              smoke of hit colleague.</p>
            <p>Mr. Offutt fulfilled his alloted "five minutes" for the bill, and in reply to Mr.
              Kimball. As to the jobbing in it - these claims are already bought up, and if it were
              not for the interest held in them by these brokers, this bill would not have been
              introduced here.</p>
            <p>Mr. Branham took the floor again, and returned to the shoeing of the justice of the
              rule, that the Government should repay at least the proceeds of the property of the
              citizen,whether taken directly for its use or in the hands of the ene- <pb n="251"
                xml:id="VAA8558-14-251"/> my - referring more specifically to Gov. Morton's
              reasoning, and making the further point, that the change of ownership does affect the
              character of a just and proper claim against the imputations of jobbery.</p>
            <p>Mr. Butts explained his opposition vote on this bill as constrained by the voice of
              his constituents.</p>
            <p>Mr Smith demanded the previous question, and there was a second and under this
              pressure the vote on Mr. Walker's motion to postpone the bill was reported. Yeas 69,
              nays 26; so the bill was indefinitely postponed.</p>
            <p>The Speaker laid before the House the Senate request for a committee of conference on
              the disagreeing votes betwixt the two Houses in regard to the Senate amendment to the
              bill [H. R. 526] to provide for the public printing and binding, and the House
              accorded the committee; whereupon the Speaker appointed Messrs. Mellett. Hardesty and
              Baker.</p>

              <p>Mr. Offutt said his attention has been directed to a paragraph in this morning
                Sentinel, alleging his repentance for having voted for the per diem bill. In
                response to which he wished to say he was neither "heart-broken" nor ''weeping with
                grief." What he had said in debate, was:If he had known that his vote for the per
                diem bill would be construed to commit him to voting in favor of the judge's bill,
                it would have changed - that vote of his. This was, perhaps, as much as he ought to
                say to a paper that is not an organ, and that has no political party.</p>

              <p>Mr. Cowgill, from the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>, returned the

              <p>Mr. Claypool opposed the bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. Cowgill and Mr. Woollen supported it - the latter at some length.</p>
              <p>Mr. Ogden proposed to amend by striking out the two first sections.</p>
              <p>Mr. Willard proposed to amend section one by averting after the word "and completed

              <p>Mr. Ogden's amendment was then adopted - affirmative 42, negative 39, which so
                disposed of Mr. Willard's.</p>
              <p>Mr. Lenfesty proposed to amend by striking out the third section.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Gregory, it was laid on the table.</p>
              <p>And then under the power of the previous question, the bill was ordered to the

              <p>Mr. King asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill in lieu of his missing bill

                laying out, altering, opening and widening of streets, alleys or highways, and
                providing for the appointment of commissioners for the assessment of benefits and
                damages, and providing for the assessment and collection of such benefits and
                damages, prescribing their duties and their methods of proceed-ure, and prescribing
                the duty of city officers in such cases, which (under a dispensation) was read
                twice.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Smith, the amendments heretofore applied by him to sections six

            that "every bill shall be read by sections on three several days in each House."Mr.
            Hough thought the bill should be amendatory of the act of 1867 instead of the act of
            1865, as the bill proposes to amend an act not now in force. He asked and obtained
            unanimous consent to so amend the bill. The bill as amended passed the Senate by yeas

            <p>The Senate, Saturday evening, was enlivened by the following interchange of

            <p>Mr. Brown. I see that the Governor of the State is present. I move that he be
              presented to the Senate by the Lieutenant Governor. [Applause.]</p>
            <p>The Lieutenant Governor. It is taken by consent. I shall be most happy to perform
              that service. (As the Hon. Thomas A. Hendricks was advancing towards the President's
              chair): Gentlemen of the Senate, I have the distinguished honor of presenting to you
              the Governor of the State. [Applause.]</p>
            <p>Governor Hendricks. Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Senate: - I am glad your
              labors are now approaching completion with such marked success. It has been a pleasure
              to me to have been associated with you in the labors of the last few weeks. I hope
              these labors will result in great benefit to our State in all our interests. I
              believe, as far as I have been able to judge, that you have pursued your labors with a
              single purpose for the good of the State; and as far as my duties have been mingled
              with yours, I know I have brought to that labor the same singleness of purpose for the
              public good. When you leave these halls on Monday night, I hope you may return to
              happy homes. [Applause.]</p>
            <p>Mr. Brown (in yielding to the persistent demand) said: The sentiments expressed by
              the Chief Executive of the State of Indiana, I think I may say, finds a hearty
              response in the breast of every Senator present: and as I am about to take my leave of
              the Senate forever I avail myself of this occasion to express my feelings of goodwill
              and friendship to each one of you; and if the heat of controversy I have said anything
                <pb n="256" xml:id="VAA8558-14-256"/> that has wounded the feelings of any I make
              this my humble apology. Thanking Senators for calling upon me to respond to the
              sentiments of the Governor, I make my bow.</p>
            <p>:A message was soon after received from the House of Representatives, announcing the
              concurrence of that body in the report of the Committee of Free Conference on the
              general appropriation bill [H. R. 534].</p>
            <p>And then the Senate adjourned until Monday morning at 9 1/2 o'clock.</p>

            <p>The bill [S. 333] for the relief of indigent cripples in the State of Indiana, was
              taken up on the first reading, and on motion of Mr Gronendyke there was a dispensation
              and it was read twice. It authorizes the County Commissioners to appropriate county

              cripples at any surgical institute of this State, on a physician's certificate of
              probable good results.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brett considered that the object of the bill is to advertise the surgical
              institutes, and it is perhaps altogether in their interests - more than in the
              interests of the people - one of the humbugs.</p>
            <p>Mr Hatch hoped the bill would not pass, because it proposed to take the patients from

            <p>Mr. Baxter. The bill originated with a member of the Society of Friends. He was
              himself a lifetime sufferer for lack of the benevolent treatment which this bill
              proposes. The treatment is not obligatory, but on the advice of a home physician, and
              in the discretion of the local commissioners.</p>

            <p>Mr. Gregory proposed to amend by striking out sections 11 and 12, placing in his

            <p>Mr. Gregory spoke generally against the bill. The compensation was excessive and

                five or six days ago.</p>
              <p>Mr. Butterworth, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Kimball considered a point of justice here,
                and that either their perquisites should be cut off for the future, or those in the
                part which the Senate would give to Shoemaker and Ryan, and which we have
                non-concurred in, ought to be reconsidered and allowed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Kimball made the motion to reconsider the vote for non-concurrence.</p>
              <p>Mr. Walker said he had understood the proposition of the gentleman from Davies (Mr.
                Brett). He had only the particular question before his mind. He would certainly vote
                to reconsider and place all parties on an equality.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brett insisted on his amendment.</p>
              <p>Mr. Kimball's motion to reconsider prevailed, and then the question recurred on
                concurrence in the Senate amendment.</p>
              <p>Mr. Branham moved to amend by striking out the perquisites of all the State
                offices, which was not insisted on; and then the Senate amendment was concurred
                in.</p>
              <p>The Senate amendment increasing the allowance for Governor's Private Secretary from
                $1,000 to $2,200 was considered and non-concurred in.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Billingsley, the vote on the Senate's allowance of $500 for
                incidentals to the expenses of the State Horticultural Society was reconsidered, and
                the allowance was concurred in - yeas 72, nays 9.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brett called up the Senate amendment to the 43d section, viz: Strike out all
                after the word "office" in the 11th line; strike out these words, "which vouchers
                shall show that the expenses have been incurred on. account of and for the use of
                the State."</p>
              <p>The House refused to concur in the amendment.</p>

                      Assembly, then shall be submitted to the people at the next general election,
                      to be held on the second Tuesday in October, eighteen hundred and
                      seventy-four; and</p>
                    <p>Whereas, For the purpose of submitting the said amendment, recited in both of
                      said joint resolutions, to the qualified electors of this State, for their
                      ratification or rejection, it was enacted by the General Assembly of the State
                      of Indiana, by an act entitled "An Act to provide for the submission to the
                      qualified electors of this State, for their ratification or rejection, a
                      proposed amendment to the Constitution of Indiana, therein mentioned, and
                      declaring an emergency,'"approved January 28, 1873, that an election be called
                      and directed to be held in the several counties of this State, and at the
                      several precincts or places of holding elections in said counties
                      respectively, for the purpose of submitting to the qualified electors of the
                      State, for their ratification or rejection, the said proposed amendment, the
                      said election to be held on the 18th day of February, in the year of our Lord
                      one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three; and,</p>
                    <p>Whereas, I did, by my proclamation of January 31, A. D. 1873, in pursuance of
                      a joint resolution of the General Assembly directing the same, notify the
                      qualified electors of the State of the holding of said election on the 18th
                      day of February, A. D. 1873, at the several places of holding elections in the
                      several counties of the State for the purposes prescribed in said act;
                      and,</p>
                    <p>Whereas, It has been certified to the Secretary of State by the Clerks of the
                      Circuit Courts of the several counties of the State (except the counties of
                      Pulaski and Scott) that at an election held in said several counties, as
                      provided by said law, on the 18th day of February, A. D. 1873, the aggregate
                      "for the proposed amendment to the Constitution'' was one hundred and
                      fifty-eight thousand and four hundred, and "against the proposed amendment to
                      the Constitution" was one-thousand and thirty; and,</p>
                    <p>Whereas, The entire number of votes in said counties of Pulaski and Soctt, if
                      cast, could not change the result of said election; and,</p>
                    <p>Whereas, The Governor and Secretary of State have this day examined the
                      certificates of the said Clerks, as required by law, and have declared that it
                      appears therefrom that a majority of all the votes cast at said election were
                      in favor of the adoption of said proposed amendment; therefore, I, Thomas A.
                      Hendricks, Governor of the State of Indiana, do hereby declare and proclaim
                      that the said proposed amendment has been duly ratified by the people, and
                      that the same is now a part of the Constitution of the State of Indiana, to be
                      known and designated as "Section 7 of Article X."</p>

            <p>The yeas and nays being demanded; after the roll call was commenced, for fear it

            <p>Mr. Harney had leave to withdraw his road bill [S. 108] from the flies of the

            <p>Mr. Brown called up the special order, being Mr. Slater's bill [S. ] to repeal the
              dog tax law.</p>
            <p>On motion by Mr. Friedley, of Lawrence, the reading of the bill was dispensed with
              that the Senator from Franklin may be heard at once.</p>
            <p>Mr. President. Many moons ago, I was requested by a venerable rural constituent of
              mine, old father Petty, to plead for an abatement of the yearly tariff upon his "old
              dog Tray," the faithful protector of his domestic hearthstone, and the saving clause
              of his poultry yard from the encroachments of the 'possums and coons which grow
              corpulent by feeding upon his feathered brood. That my voice should be raised on
              behalf of his "dog" was, in fact, one of the conditions and contingencies under which
              I received his suffrage for the honorable position upon this floor and in approaching
              the momentous question which has engaged the attention of the wisest, best and purest
              statesmen of Indiana, since she first emerged from the maidenhood of territorial
              innocence into the blooming maturity of years crowded into the halo of matronly grace.
              I feel my utter inability to do justice to the subject, and freely confess to a degree
              of embarrassment I never felt before.Then, notwithstanding my pledge to my old friend
              Petty, I am at a loss which side of this proposition to advocate.</p>
            <p>What the Englishman is to the Italian, what the Italian is to the Hindoo, what the
              Hindoo is to the Bengaliese, and what the Bengaliese is to other Bengailese, that is
              this bill to the enlightened constituencies which are represented in this Senate by
              the selected wisdow of the commonwealth.</p>
            <p>And I fain would wish that I might dip my pen in the red and seething lava that is
              thrown from the overloaded stomach of sick and vomiting Versuvius and writ upon the
              scroll of the broad and glittering fermament, the deep and consuming thoughts of
              indignation that swell and burn in my passionate bosom when I reflect upon the want of
              interest with which this bill is treated by Senators upon this floor. We are, sir,
              discussing the question of "dog," and perish the base thought that I, the boon
              companion of dogs since the assumption of my legislative career, should fail to raise
              my voice, and, in the name of the majesty of the State, and by the lingering and
              sacred memory of the huntsman and the hound, invoke your gravest consideration to the
              measure before us.</p>
            <p>Dogs! How glowing the theme! The council of the brave and reverend Senators of Rome,
              in the days of her republican glory, never considered a subject so potent for the
              destruction of fleas, and the protection of sheep.</p>
            <p>Byron, the poet of excellence or romance has sung the praises of his canine friends
              in words of poetic melody; and we all know how sweet it is:</p>
            <lg type="free">
              <l>"Hear the watch dog's honest bark,</l>
              <l> Bay deep mounted welcome as we draw near home,</l>
              <l>To know there is an eye to watch our coming,</l>
              <l> And look brighter when we come."</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And, sir, I'd rather be a dog myself - [voices"Consent,"] and bay the moon, than fail
              to give the just meed of pity or praise to the decendants of that toothless, decrepid
              old "Dog Tray," who, born of "poor though honest parents," tarnished a record of a
              long life of usefulness by one ill considered act.</p>
            <p>Why, sir, over his last resting place over the sepulchral home which shelters all
              that was mortal of him. I shed the tear of bitter sorrow, and I feel in my heart of
              hearts that if I should on this occasion hesitate to do justuice to his blighted but
              still instructive memory, I should encounter such a storm of righteous and indignant
              reproach as no mortal ever knew before. The lean and mangy whelpwith "hound mongrel,
              and cur of low degree," all over our broad land"the best and freest the sun ever shown
              upon," would join in the chorus and send me "kiting" down the twilight shades of dire
              oblivion.</p>
            <p>Sir, I know dogs. I had a dog once, a benchleg fiste and of her anon. I was raised
              with dogs. How often, oh how often, in the days that have gone by, I have hied me to
              my rest with their pictures in my eye. I have laid down with dogs, and have invariably
              thereafter gotten up with fleas. They - I mean the dogs - were the first and dearest
              playmates of my guiltless and unsuspecting youth</p>
            <p>I have often in my boyhood's sunny time, wandered with them through the forest,
              hushed so still with mournful silence that the singing whippoorwill scarce knew his
              notes; through fields rich and golden with colors from nature's royal dye-works; on
              the pebbly beach of lakes that rested like dazzling breast pins upon the bosom of the
              landscape, and by the still bright banks of the Ohio, which, wending its way through
              many a charming woodland dell sang sweet saluting songs to the Father of Waters which
              it sought.</p>
            <p>I hope gentlemen will not laugh and make light of this subject, for, sir, it
              transcends in importance all the legislation of this country since the adoption of the
              Fifteenth Amendment, not excepting my own resolutions of inquiry into the "raised
              vouchers."&gt; &gt;[?The draining law dwarfs into insignificance before it; the act
              for building a new State House hides its diminished head; the temperance bills are
              mere bagatelle; and the million dollar canal grab a mere song.In this solemn hour of
              our State, brought about by the imperilled situation of this bill, in this hour of
              sadness, darkness, doubt and gloom, let us take counsel of our judgment and not of our
              fears, and acquit ourselves in a manner that will show to the world that 'tis moral
              grandeur makes the mighty man.</p>
            <p>By hasty legislation we may cur-tail the life, liberty and pursuit of happiness of
              our canine population, privileges guaranteed to them by the bill of rights, inherent
              and inalienable in every dog.</p>
            <p>Let us stand upon our own responsbility and poise ourselves upon our magnaminity like
              Mount Atlas when storms and temptests thunder at its brow and oceans break their
              billows at his feet.</p>
            <p>I have not yet finished my panegyric upon the dog. Were I a Cicero, a Burke, a
              Webster, or even approachingly eloquent as the Senator from Grant in his panegyric
              upon political graves. I would carry you upon wings of seraphic eloquence, musical
              with silvery tongued accents of divinest beauty, to the vast solitude of a forest
              dell, under the umbrageous foliage of some tall sycamore, upon the banks of Coon
              Creek, where my dog "Daisy" gathers around her, her orphan litter of thirteen pups,
              and with maternal tenderness tells them of their dear departed father.</p>
            <p>Were I a Homer, a Milton or a Moore, how sweet indeed would be the lines of sparkling
              poetry in which my "Daisy's" virtues should be told; where if I were only a Beethoven,
              I'd set those lines to music, and the fair, sweet singer, Nilsson, assisted by the
              Senator from Owen, should warble them forth upon the hushed and listening breeze to
              greet our enraptured senses and charm us with the sublimity of song. And, sir, the
              brightest intellects of other lands have taken a <pb n="267" xml:id="VAA8558-14-267"
              />deep interest in the welfare and longevity of our canine population; for, sir, I am
              indebted to Joe Colcord, of St. Louis, one of Missouri's ablest state men, for many of
              the finest points of my remarks to-day.</p>
            <p>This question belongs, not like Dodo, or the Tuneful Swan, to the days of fiction or
              of fable. No, Mr. President, the little, fleecy lap dog, whose envious and desirable
              habitation (usurped domes that rightfully belong to man) in the arms of her who is
              rarest and fairst of Jehovah's earthly handiwork, the last being of God's creation,
              made after the heavens and the earth, sun, moon, stars and angels - an improvement on
              them all. Before her invention, the little garden upon the banks of the Euphrates was
              a desolate wild, and man, the hermit, sighed and dug his potatoes in silence and
              solitude, and I marvel not that the Senators from Elkhart, Adams, Vermillion, Dearborn
              and Washington, should desire a treble tariff to cur-tail the privileges of each and
              every poodleistic pup. They are unlucky dogs, on whose cheerless life no woman's
              loving smile has ever fallen. 'Tis their own fault that they have no radiant little
              butterfly to rule at their home circle and run them in debt at the dry goods
              stores.</p>
            <p>Mr. President, I love to dwell upon this subject, and I hope the bold, original,
              unique, and independent Senator from Marion, who has dipped his laurels in
              immortality, and whose name will go tumbling down the ages, linked with Sumner, Thad.
              Stevens, and Fred Douglas, in favor of the propagation of wool, will forego his
              predilection for that great staple of the Radical party long enough to do justice to
              the numerous progeny of the lamentable Tray.</p>
            <p>Sir, I love mutton-chops, but I cannot forgo my predilections for dogs. My lamb-like
              nature has inherited and matured a political antipithy for wool, and as legislation
              for the last decade, all over the broad land, has been founded upon fanaticism,
              passion and prejudice, I will not say: "Dogs, go back to your kennels from whence you
              came, and say I sent you! I'm none of you your bones are marrowless and your blood is
              cold. Henceforth, until I cross the dark river, and moor my bark upon the Echoless
              shore, there is eternal war between you and me." No, Mr. President, I can not say
              this. But the wide gulf which divides me and the Southdowns I have closed. I have
              burned my ships behind me, landed on the soil of the enemy, drawn my sword for the
              conquest and thrown away the scabbard.</p>
            <p>Like the young knight of Ivanhoe, or brave Richard of the Lion Heart, I shall fight
              in this war between dogs and sheep, a war that has no parrallel in the intensity of
              its bitterness, except in that long and sanguniary contest between the houses of York
              and Lancaster, between the white rose pale as death and the red rose red as blood; and
              if I fail it will be like the good King Godfrey, of the Crusades, I will be down in
              full harness, panoplied all over with the glories of war. The mastiffs, ratters,
              pointers, and poodles must, and, by the eternal shall, be preserved.</p>
            <p>I know that this Senate will repeal the tariff upon my old friend's faithful
              watch-dogs. The civilization of the age demand it. A consummation devoutly to be
              wished the extirpation of the great radical party, which covers its nakedness with
              wool, and to whom that staple product is food, meat, drink, votes, and "gruel for the
              sick folks," demands it. The lessons of all history, the teachings of philosophy from
              Plato and Socrates to Frichie and Hogel, directs us to this high vantage ground of
              progress. The future beckons with jeweled finger, leading us to the grandest
              consummation of the ages, and we will repeal this dog law.If I fail in this
              irrepressible conflict, in which we must become all dogs or all sheep, then , oh,
              shade of the sainted Rover; spirit of Fido, my best beloved poodle, buried, (but not
              forgot) in the twilight of years long ago, avert your heads and invert your tails for
              grave political considerations demand that our heart's best blood shall form the theme
              for fact and fiction in the unforgotten love of future ages.</p>
            <p>The House concurrent resolution in relation to the care and custody of the public
              grounds was read, amended and passed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hall offered a resolution directing the Secretary to collate the number of
              petitions for and against the temperance law to the present Legislature, the number of
              petitioners to be set forth by counties.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sleeth moved to amend so as to show the number of petitions that came here asking
              for the passage of the House bill without amendment.</p>
            <p>The resolution was amended so as to request the <orgName>Committee on
                Temperance</orgName> to turn over all petitions to the author of the pending
              resolution, and as so amended it was adopted.</p>
            <p>Subsequently Mr. Hall submitted the following:</p>
            <p>Mr. President: The undersigned to whom was referred the petitions and remonstrances
              for and against the passage of a temperance law, submits herewith a detailed statement
              showing the number of petitioners as 32,596. Those who petitioned for a law numbered
              28,421. Those who petitioned against a law 4,175. It is but just and fair to state
              that not more than one half the petitions for the passage of a law are in the
              possession of the Senate Many of the members having the petitions from their own
              counties in their possession and unwilling to give them up; others have been
              destroyed. I do not think it overstated to say that 60,000 of the citizens of Indiana
              have during the late session petitioned the legislature for a good temperance law.
              Very respectfully yours,</p>
            <p rend="right">ABEL W. HALL,<lb/>Senator from Clark and Floyd. </p>

            <head rend="center">AMENDMENTS OF THE CONSTITUTION.</head>
            <p>The Speaker now returned to the consideration, of Mr. Cauthorn's proposition to amend
              the Constitution of the State, and it was again read by the Clerk - Mr. Cauthorn
              stating that its object is to make the general election to come on the same day on
              which the Presidential election is held. He stated also that there is a provision in
              one of the committee propositions whereby we may elect our judges at some other time,
              if the Legislature should think it proper so to direct by law.</p>
            <p>Mr. Givan. The law of Congress fixing the time for the Presidential election says not
              the "first Tuesday in November," but the first Tuesday after the first Monday in
              November."</p>
            <p>Mr. Cauthorn. Yes. I will amend my proposition in that respect.</p>
            <p>Mr. Walker. Is that one of the resolution submitted Saturday by the Joint Committee
              on Constitutional amendments?</p>
            <p>Mr Cauthorn. No.</p>
            <p>Mr. Walker that Committee had this proposition under consideration; and they refused
              to propose the change, because that is regulated by a statute of the State, and needs
              not a constitutional amendment to authorize it: and I remember that the gentleman from
              Ripley, (Mr. Wilson,) promised to introduce a bill to change the time of the general
              election, and fix it on the Tuesday following the first Monday of November.</p>
            <p>Mr. Givan the law of Congress makes tuis provision for the time of the Presidential
              election; and, as it has been amended, it becomes necessary that this change should be
              made so that our Congressmen shall be elected on the Tuesday succeeding the first
              Monday in November.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cauthorn now sent up his proposition to amend section 14, article 2, and it was
              read by the Clerk as follows: Section 14. All general elections shall be held on such
              days as shall be provided by law. Adopted - yeas 66, nays 1.</p>

              vote - yeas 33, nays 33 - by which the resolution was rejected.</p>

            <p>Mr. Hardesty Mr Speaker: I will ask the clerk to read the sentence marked in an
              Editorial article in this mornings Sentinel, which I send up.</p>
            <p>The Clerk read as follows:</p>
            <p>"Mr. Edwards can hardly afford to end his term to-day with the impression abroad that
              either through cowardice or something worse, he has been bullied or brought to defeat
              the desire of the people at the dictation of a persistently fraudulent company. The
              entire printing interests of the State House of Representatives for a base betrayal of
              the public by their action on the printing bill. That the House was sold outbound by a
              bargain and corrupt in its course on that question is as clear as that there were
              honest men in the Senate."</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardesty. I now submit the following.</p>
            <floatingText>
              <body>
                <div type="resolution">
                  <p>Whereas, The Indianapolis Sentinel of the 10th instant published the foregoing
                    charges against the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives;
                    therefore,</p>
                  <p><hi rend="i">Resolved</hi>, That the Doorkeeper arrest and bring before the bar
                    of this House its reputed editor, H. S. Keenan to answer to the demand if the
                    House for the evidence upon which he will rest those charges.</p>
                </div>
              </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>Let him come to the bar ot the PTou* us what he knows about thesf1 charges.</p>
            <p>Mr. Miller. I think the Constitution does not contemplate or confer the power to
              punish upon this House, except for contempt and a breach of privilege; and these
              cannot be committed outside, as in this case.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardesty. The resolution does not propose to punish this man, but to bring him to
              the bar to testify.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gregory did not think we could act upon that. Though he had no favoring word for
              the article; he saw no power in the House to interfere with matters outside. He wished
              to inquire what is the position of the public printing bill before the House?</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardesty. The bill reported by a majority of the Special Committee, and which was
              originally drafted by himself, was passed this House by a majority of six or seven
              votes more than the Constitutional majority . It went to the Senate, and the Senate
              bill was submitted as an amendment to it - something similar in its provisions to the
              bill of the gentleman from Johnson [Mr. Woollen,] And when it came back to the House a
              large majority refused to concur. The Senate also refused to recede, and thereupon two
              committees of conference were appointed, neither of which could come to any agreement
              on the conflicting propositions. The House bill is now in the Senate with the Senate
              amendments.</p>
            <p>Mr. Johnson. Mr. Speaker: If you are going to hang this man, I want to change my vote
              on the resolution in relation to capital punishment.</p>
            <p>Mr. Branham. If we pass this resolution it will be a firstrate advertisement for the
              Sentinel.</p>
            <p>Mr. Miller. But is it not true that this is the only remedy the House has against an
              insult? Let him come before the House and tells us what he knows about the honesty of
              the other end of the Capitol; and what he knows about the corruption of this end.</p>
            <p>Mr. Richardson was opposed to the resolution for several reasons; he was opposed to
              making an example of the editor of the Sentinel, so long as there are many others
              implicated in the same matter; and, if we are to do this thoroughly, it <pb n="271"
                xml:id="VAA8558-14-271"/> would require a special session of the General Assembly.
              He knew that many papers in the State have slandered the General Assembly in this way,
              indeed there are few papers in the State that have not done do. So far as he
              individually was concerned he cared nothing about it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Butterworth thought this resolution ought not to pass. I believe a good deal in
              the freedom of the press, and while I here denounce the charges of the Sentinel as
              false in every respect, there is one thing I have always held certain in this world,
              and that is that a quarrel with a woman or an editor is very unprofitable business.
              [Laughter.]</p>
            <p>Mr. Henderson doubted the power of the House in the case and to adopt the resolution
              would certainly be a very foolish thing.</p>
            <p>Mr. Blocher. I move to lay the resolution on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardesty. Mr. Speaker: I beg leave to withdraw the resolution; and there being no
              objection the resolution was withdrawn.</p>

          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">AMENDMENTS OF THE CONSTITUTION.</head>
            <p> Mr. Miller submitted two propositions to amend the Constitutionof the State, viz.:
              add to section 4 Art. XV.; "It shall be the duty of the first General Assembly, first
              convening after the taking effect of this amendment, by proper legislation to submit
              to the female inhabitants of the State over twenty-one years, the proposition to
              confer the ballot upon themselves to be decided by the result of their vote'for female
              sufferage' or 'against female suffrage.'" "Section 5. If the greater number of votes
              be for female suffrage, shall be extended to all the females of the State of 21 years
              and over, having the same qualifications as other electors." This (he said) is
              carrying out the recommendation of Gov. Baker to the General Assembly. </p>
            <p>Mr. Butterworth moved to lay the resolution on the table; but the motion was not
              entertained.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gronendyke submitted a joint resolution to amend the Constitution in Article II,
              section 2, by striking out the word "male" where it occurs after the word "white."</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Butterworth it was laid on the table 0 affirmative 36, negative
              30.</p>
            <p>The Speaker. The Clerk informs the Chair that he has not reported to the Senate the
              amendments to the Constitution adopted on Saturday, because there was no vote taken on
              the adoption of the several propositions submitted by the gentleman from Johnson as a
              whole. It is proper that the House should recur to those propositions take them up and
              consider them as a whole I understand that there were ten of these propositions in
              all; and three of them were rejected. The rejected propositions, of course, are not
              before the House. Only those that were approved on Saturday are now to be voted on as
              a whole: and accordingly</p>
            <p>Mr. Cauthorn's joint resolution for amendment of the Constitution of the State, and
              also the seven propositions as recited in the proceedings of Saturday were taken up
              and adopted - yeas 51, nays 16.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hatch proposed to amend the Constitution of the State by an addition to this
              effect: Art. - , section - . Railroads heretofore constructed or that may be herealter
              constructed are hereby declared to be common Public Highways, and may be owned and
              operated for the transportation of persons and property under such regulatiouns as
              shall be provided by law; and the General Assembly shall provide by law the maximum
              rates, and shall pass laws to prevent abuses and unjust discriminations; and shall
              enforce the same by adequate penalties to the extent, if necessary, of forfeiture of
              property and franchises. He said: I do not wish to make a speech only to say, that
              that resolution embraces an exact copy of the provision in the new Constitution of the
              State of Illinois in regard to railroads. I believe it might be adopted here; and that
              if the people have a chance to vote on it, it will be adopted by a large majority: and
              I ask the friends of the Railroads here to vote for it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gregory. I believe this proposition has merit, but, for the reason that we have
              not time to consider it, I move to lay it on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hatch demanded the yeas and nays whereupon - </p>
            <p>Mr. Gregory withdrew his motion to lay on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. Butterworth. We are now within an hour of the final adjournment, and it seems to
              me that it is not right to pass on such a grave matter as this when we do not know,
              and have no time to consider, whether it is right or not.</p>
            <p>The proposition was lost for want of the prescribed majority - yeas 48, nays 8- 20
              present and not voting.</p>

                  <p>WHEREAS, The issue of the Indianapolis Sentinel of this date contains a wanton

                    on public printing; and,</p>

            <p>Mr. Gregory considered that if we pass a censure of this character on this newspaper,
              we ought to extend it so as to include every newspaper in the State. He ventured the
              assertion that there is not a paper of any distinct character in the State that has
              not published matter equally reprehensible with that in the Sentinel; and if the
              Sentinel has slandered the House, there is not a paper in the State but has done as
              much. I make the motion that they all be included in the resolution.</p>
            <p>The Speaker the amendment is not in order, because it does not specify persons and

            <p>Mr. Woollen. This is the second time that I have served in the General Assembly as a
              member of this House. During my first term Judge Buskirk was in the Chair, and this
              time the gentleman from Vigo. I have watched his decisions narrowly and I believe that
              they heve been received with unanimous, universal approbation: and I believe it a just
              opinion, that his decisions as Speaker have been eminently fair; and if he has given
              favor to any, it has as often fallen to those acting with the party opposed to him as
              to those acting with the party in unison with him. I desire to say this, from ihe
              fact, that the position of Speaker is both difficult and delicate; and when a
              gentleman so acts in it as not to incur the displeasure of any, I sincerely think that
              he is entitled to thanks.</p>
            <p>Mr. Givan endorsed the remarks of the gentleman from Johnson. He also was a member of
              the House during the Speakership of Judge Buskirk and the present incumbent. It seemed
              to him throughout these sessions that no man could take serious exceptions to the
              rulings of the gentleman from Vigo; and it was with great pleasure that he bore this
              testimony to the uniformly courteous deportment of the Speaker.</p>
            <p>Mr. Buskirk proposed to strike out the word "sympathies," as redundant; and Mr.
              Cauthorn acquiesced Whereupon, the resolution was adopted by the rising vote - the
              Speaker pro tem. (Mr. Walker) saying: It is with great pleasure, (because it in
              accordance with my own vote,) that the Chair announces that the House of
              Representatives unanimously approves the course of the gentleman from Vigo.</p>

            <head rend="center">THE PUBLIC PRINTING.</head>
            <p>Mr. Gregory now called up the consideration of the Joint Resolution S. No. 22,
              authorizing the letting of the Public Printing paper buying and binding to the lowest
              responsible bidderby the Governor, Secretary, Auditor and Treasurer of the State.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hardesty demanded a call of the House.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mellett. I have been one of those several members here who, during the present
              session of the Legislative, have worked faithfully in order to get a bill for the
              public printing in the interests of the people. Our work, such as it has been, has
              gone to the record; and I stand upon that. I believe that the bill which this House
              acted upon and which we sent to the Senate, would have protected the printing
              interests of the State better than any other method that could possibly be devised. It
              was upon the question of letting the public printing to the lowest bidder that the
              Senate disagreed to that bill. The House offered two methods: one was the bill sent to
              the Senate, and the other was for the letting of the Public Printing to the lowest
              bidder; (as by the pending resolution;) that was the bill prepared by the gentleman
              from Johnson (Mr. Woollen;) it was voluminous, but carefully drawn - its provisions
              hedged about, the treasury so as to guard the interests of the people in every
              direction; and whilst I might have been willing to vote for that bill, I could not be
              willing to vote for the Senate bill - that was thrust upon us as an amendment to our
              bill - that Senate amendment was a contract system bill, and very loosely drawn.</p>
            <p>And when it became a question, whether we shall have this bill or leave the law as it
              is, I said, let us leave it as it is. The result is, that the public printing will be
              left to be executed under the statutes of 1852 and 1853dividing the responsibility of
              the superintendance between the Secretary and the Governor of the State. And I think
              that as safe a place to rest this interest as could be afforded at present by any law
              which we could pass on the subject. I hope, therefore, that the House will not be so
              indiscrete as to pass this Senate resolution for the naked contract system, which will
              open again upon us those floodgates of peculation and corruption, of the effects of
              which we have had some experience. I move to lay it on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. Woollen. Does this resolution provide for the continuance of the public printing
              after the adjournment?</p>
            <p>Mr. Mellett. I so understand it. I understand also, that under the existing law the
              printing will be contracted for under the supervision of the Governor and Secretary of
              State. It will be perhaps, about equally distributed between the parties. I insist on
              my motion to lay the resolution on the table.</p>

                      This (he said) will make up the $300 which the service performed is worth, and
                      which he was employed to perform - having no other service as stated by a
                      member of the Judiciary Committee. And now the question is whether we will cut

                  </div>
                </body>
              </floatingText>
              <p>Mr. Mellett. When this question was up the other day I asked the question whether
                this Janitor to the Committee was not also Janitor to the United States Court? and
                the question was not then answered; but I have since learned that he was not; that
                he was brought here from Bloomington, and put in simply to attend to this
                business.</p>
              <p>Mr. Branham. My opinion is that that amount ought to be paid; but, under the
                decisions of our Courts, it can not be paid in that way by resolution.</p>
              <p>Mr. Johnson. I know of a similar allowance that has been paid on the order of the
                Chairman of the Committee.</p>
              <p>Mr. Branham. But now the Auditor of State has determined to follow the law
                strictly; and the law says, that, where there is law; no resolution of the House can
                altar that law; and all that can be legally drawn is what the law provides.</p>
              <p>Mr. Miller. Couldn't it be paid out of the appropriation for the expenses of the
                Legislature?</p>
              <p>Mr. Branham. Not unless the amount be fixed by law.</p>
              <p>Mr. Miller. The Auditor had paid for the Senate newspapers in that way.</p>
              <p>Mr. Branham. I think, if the gentleman will apply to at the Auditor's office he
                will find that it has not been allowed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Johnson. I did not know till just now that $100 had been allowed to Mr. Norton;
                but that young man has earned his money. I am informed that the Journal and Sentinel
                have been paid on the Senate resolution. A gentleman near me says so.</p>
              <p>Mr. Mellett. It certainly becomes us to make the just allowance for services we
                have contracted for and received. I suppose this is one of the things for which the
                law does not provide. It is the wish of all to make the allowance for the service of
                this Committee - just as we have done for every expense we have incurred - to make
                the allowance for the service and have it paid for. I suppose they all stand upon
                the same footing; and if others are paid, of course this can be; and we owe it to
                ourselves to say so. All the jurisdiction we have is over the Speaker. All we can do
                is to have the warrant signed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Smith. I think $300 is too much. [Voice; "No: that is what the others get."] I
                know that the Janitor of the <orgName>Ways and Means Committee</orgName> got $2 a
                day.</p>
              <p>Mr. Woollen. Upon inquiry, I find that the Janitor of our committee is not in the
                pay of the State at all; and $300 will not be extravagant.</p>

              <p>Mr. Smith. The State of Ohio has five Hospitals for the Insane.</p>
              <p>Mr. Heller. We passed a bill here the other day giving an Asylum north of

              <p>Mr. Johnson. That is a mistake. Marion county never voted for it.</p>
              <p>Mr. Heller. Then I am mistaken. But I know, and you know, Mr. Speaker, that this is
                for the purpose of cutting the northern people out. I therefore protest against the
                passage of this resolution, especially at this hour, and when there is not a quorum
                present.</p>

              <p>On the motion of Mr. Woollen, this Asylum resolution was passed over so far as to
                allow the House to take up that declaring the com- <pb n="275"

              <head rend="center">INSANE ASYLUM.</head>
              <p>The Speaker then returned to the question on the former resolution to authorize the
                State offices to commence the building of another Insane Asylum on the present
                Asylum grounds.</p>
              <p>Mr. Butterworth did not believe it wise or good policy to erect this building: but
                in his opinion provision should be made at once for the accommodation of at least
                two or three hundred of this class - not for medical treatment, but for the care of
                chronic cases - and thus relieve the counties from the care of those chronic cases.
                We can furnish places for perhaps 250 patients of this class at the Reformatory,
                which would be filled up at once with women and girls. Now, therefore, since we all
                have confidence in the Governor and the State officers, I move to reconsider the
                vote by which we voted down the resolution converting the Reformatory Institution
                into an Insane Asylum.</p>
              <p>Mr. Hollingsworth. I think it would be improper and very wrong, especially at this
                time and in such an inconsiderate manner to divert the Reformatory from its original
                purpose.</p>
              <p>The House refused to reconsider: and then on the motion of Mr. Tully, the matter
                was laid on the table - yeas 22, nays 19.</p>
              <p>Mr. Mellett. I would like to have the Chairman of the <orgName>Committee on Ways
                  and Means</orgName> to state what he knows about this matter.</p>
              <p>Mr. Kimball. I hope some gentleman will move a reconsideration of the vote that
                laid the Insane Asylum resolution on the table.</p>

              <p>The Speaker laid before the House the following message from the Senate, just now

              <p>Mr. Gifford I move that this House now adjourn sine die: whereupon - </p>
              <p>The Speaker said: Gentlemen of the House of Representatives, we are now at the
                close of another laborious session. This General Assembly has been eminently
                successful in originatig and completing most of the important legislation required
                by the necessities of the State. The two sessions through which we have passed have
                not been without their important lessons in legislative practice. One of these must
                be apparent to every member. It is that the general and specific appropriation bills
                should not be left to the haste and confusion of the closing hours, but should be
                considered and matured at as early a day of the session as the course of business
                will permit. Another is the danger of grouping together a large number of subjects
                and interests in one appropriation bill, and considering them all at the same time.
                Each subject or class of appropriations should stand upon its own merits and be
                separately acted upon.</p>
              <p>The enactments which you have assisted in making, are important to the best
                interests of society intended for the good of the State, and a proper respect for
                law and order, requires their due and faithful execution.</p>
              <p>The uniform kindness and courtesy that you have so uniformly extended to me, and
                the unusual harmony which has prevailed during our deliberations, has created on my
                part a warm sentiment of personal attachment to each one of you, without
                exception.</p>
              <p>The generous resolution you passed this morning, the manner of it, impress me still
                more sensibly with the highest obligation which your kindness has placed upon me.
                The feeling that our intercourse has produced commands from me not friendship alone,
                but that which the kindliest and purest sentiments of the heart direct.</p>
              <p>As you will now return to your respective homes, I wish you the fullest enjoyment
                of health, happiness and success in life.</p>
              <p>Pursuant to your order, I now pronounce this House adjourned sine die.</p>

            <p> Mr. SCOTT. I understand that until a quorum answers to their names upon a call by
              the Clerk, the Senate can do no business, because it is not an organized body. It is
              nothing. Suppose they never come? What is the remedy? The Governor must order an
              election from the districts where the parties do not appear, and you can't put your
              finger upon a law that will compel a man to come here who has not appeared at this
              session.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. Unfortunately for the gentleman's argument we have none of that
              kind.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. But we are trying to get a quorum.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. Not of Senators who were never here.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. It don't make any difference whether they have been here or not.</p>
            <p>Mr. DITTEMORE. I desire to get a little light from the Senator for Vigo, [Mr. Scott]
              on this Constitutional provision: "Two-thirds of each House shall constitute a quorum
              to do business: but a smaller number may meet, adjourn from day to day, and compel the
              attendance of absent members."</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. A smaller number of what?</p>
            <p>Mr. DITTEMORE. Of Senators of this body.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. I beg your pardon. Read it again.</p>
            <p>Mr. DITTEMORE. "Two-thirds of aech House shall constitute a quorum to do business
              ;"Mr. SCOTT (interposing.) What is a House?Mr. DITTEMORE (continuing,) "but a smaller
              number may meet, and adjourn from day to day, and compel the attendance of absent
              members."</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. But you must have a "House" before you do that; and you can't have a
              "House" without a quorum.</p>
            <p>Mr. SLATER. The Senator from Vigo, [Mr. Scott,] is certainly disposed to be very
              technical.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. I don't want to be. The only difficulty we find is that we ain't got men
              enough to form a quorum, and what are you going to do?</p>
            <p>Mr. DITTEMORE. Send for them.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. Who will you send ?</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. Officers.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. We haven't any.</p>
            <p>Mr. DITTEMORE. Send the Sheriff.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. I would like to see an officer take me by color of authority derived from
              this body. But there is no doubt about this point: Enough members have not answered to
              make a quorum; and what are you going to do? Suppose we meet to-morrow and they don't
              come, what are you going to do? We can only wait for the Governor to order a new
              election, as I understand it. I admit <pb n="277" xml:id="VAA8558-14-277"/> that some
              rules of an organized body come in here. The general law prevails in this body
              although not organized. The ordinary parliamentary law would apply, and we are
              governed by that in matters of decorum, I admit: but, when you come to the other point
              we simply lack members enough to have a House. We can talk here from now till the
              middle of next week, if we want to, without a quorum being present.</p>
            <p>Mr. SMITH. I rise to a point of order. There is nothing before the Senate.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. I agree with the Senator exactly on that point; but he is too late in
              making the point on me.</p>
            <p>Mr DWIGGINS. I rise to a point of order. The point of order that I make is that there
              is no Senate for anything to be before.</p>
            <p>Mr. ORR. I understand the Senator from Vigo has the floor and has not yielded it. He
              is still standing.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. That is a way the Senator has of taking his seat. [Laughter.]</p>
            <p>Mr. SLATER. I would like to ask if the Senator knows that these absent Senators will
              not come in, or have bolted to prevent the repeal by the Senate of that outragethe
              odious apportionment bill passed at the last session. [Renewed Laughter.]</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. I am happy to hear that the Senator from Vigo [Mr. Scott] acknowledges
              that there is some law to govern us; and I hope the Senator will not take it back. Mr.
              W. read from Jefferson's manual page 27, authority for a less number than a quorum to
              send the Sergeant-at-Arms, or any other person or persons, for absent members, and
              said: There are members here who have been sworn in as Senators, the presiding officer
              is in the chair, and they have the right to send for members of the Senate who have
              been sworn in.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE, (interposing.) Is there a Senate here?</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. When we have no Senate we may send for absentees; and if we have no
              Sergeant-at-Arrns we may appoint one.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. We are again the victims of what the Senator from Knox [Mr. Williams]
              frequently brings in here for the purpose of taking, not intentionally, unfair
              advantage of Senators, not so well versed in Parliamentary Law as himself. The Senator
              has brought in a rule for the government of the Senate of the U. S. when it becomes an
              organized body, which was adopted in 1868 or thereabouts. The Senator from Vigo [Mr.
              Scott,] is right about the matter. The 10th section, of Art., IV of the Constitution
              provides :"</p>
            <p>Section 10. Each House when assembled shall choose its own officers, (the President
              of the Senate excepted,] judge the elections, qualifications, and returns, of its own
              members, determine its rules of proceeding, and sit upon its own adjournment. But
              neither House shall, without the consent of the other, adjourn for more than three
              days, nor to any place other than that in which it may be sitting."</p>
            <p>This has reference to what a body may do after it is organized. The next section
              provides: "Two-thirds of each House shall constitute a quorum to do business; but a
              smaller number may meet, adjourn from day to day, and compel the attendance of absent
              members." This also applies to what a body may do after it is organized. It is laying
              down rules for the government, action and conduct of a body after its organization. It
              provides that after you have a Senate organized and equipped for the transaction of
              legislative business, that a less number than two-thirds may meet, adjourn from day to
              day, and compel the attendance of absent members. The 12th section provides:"</p>
            <p>SEC. 12. Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and publish the same.
              The yeas and nays, on any question, shall, at the request of any two members, be
              entered, together with the names of the members demanding the same, on the journal:
              Provided, that on a motion to adjourn, it shall require one-tenth of the members
              present to order the yeas and nays."</p>
            <p>This has application to the action of a body after it is organized, therefore I may
              well say that we have no power to call the yeas and nays. There is no power to go
              beyond the inquiry whether the number of Senators are present which the Constitution
              requires as sufficient to do business. It is perhaps a weakness on the part of the
              Constitution that there is no section in it authorizing less than a quorum to compel
              absentees to come in before an organization is effected. I suppose that the good men
              that made the Constitution, thought the members of the Legislature would always come
              together at the appointed time, and so there was no provision made that in case of a
              failure of the requisite number coming together to organize, those who did come should
              compel the attendance of those who did not come. The idea of sitting here and calling
              the yeas and nays, is outside and not inside the Constitution. There is no rule
              governing the conduct of the persons here trying to perform a little of the duties of
              Senators. I should like to see the Senator from Knox [Mr. Williams,] fasten his grip
              upon some one he thought to be a Senator, and try to compel that one to come here and
              participate in the deliberations, or an attempt to organize the Senate. It is only
              after the Senate is organized that you can compel the attendance of absentees.
              Therefore, as I said a while ago, when we met this morning, and adjourned, we
              discharged all the legislative functions the Constitution has clothed us with. It was
              an <pb n="278" xml:id="VAA8558-14-278"/> adjournment until to-morrow. The Constitution
              so fixes that adjournment, and it has been a mistake that we assembled this afternoon.
              Let us do what I think is a reasonable and proper thing; let us rise and come back
              tomorrow, and see whether a sufficient number is then present to complete and perfect
              an organization. If not, then do what the Constitution says - adjourn till next day.
              After giving it a fair trial, if no quorum appear then the organization of the Senate
              goes by default by reason of the absence of persons who should appear here. There is
              no power in the Constitution to punish them for it, and no power to bring them here.
              It is simply resting upon; their good faith they impliedly gave to the people that
              elected them, that they should appear at the time the Constitution says they should
              appear.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS (interposing.) Has not Marion county got two Senators, elected and
              qualified?</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. Yes sir, she has.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. They are not here.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. I can't help that. They are elected and qualified; I concede that: at the
              same time Senators must agree with me that before any legislative action can be had
              there must be an organization of the Senate: and until that organization has been had
              and perfected, there is no power to send for these absent Senators and bring them in.
              They come voluntarily or they do not come at all. It is with their consciences for
              them to determine, and there is nothing in the Constitution to compel their
              attendance.</p>
            <p>Mr. ORR. The Senator from Shelby [Mr. Glessner,] told the Senate that the gentleman;
              from Jackson [Mr. Brown,] didn't make a good point on the Constitutionality of the
              subject now before us. I will say now to the Senator, and if the Senator ain't here, I
              will say to the audience that I will not agree - never would I agree with the Senator
              from Jackson when he was wrong; but I concede that the gentleman from Jackson made a
              good point on the Constitutionality of this question, which I think settles it. There
              is no doubt of it. The 11th section of the Constitution in Article IV settles it
              clearly. It says "two-thirds of each House shall constitute a quorum to do business."
              As I regard it there ain't two-thirds of the Senate here. The Constitution goes on to
              state: "but a smaller number may I meet, adjourn from day to day, and compel the
              attendance of absent members." I have been informed that you met here and adjourned.
              Now that adjournment carries you over till to morrow according to the Constitution.
              That is the point the gentleman from Jackson made, and I say he has the right on that
              point.</p>
            <p>Mr. DITTEMORE. The proposition before us, as I understand it is as to whether wehave
              a right to call the yeas and nays upon a motion to adjourn. [The motion was made
              immediately after the call of the Senate this afternoon, upon which motion Messrs.
              DitU -more and Bird demanded the yeas and nays, y-printed immediately before the last
              paragraph on page 17 of this book.] I desire to make ;i remark or two in reference to
              that point. The discussion has taken a wide range, and I have not been edified by any
              arguments as to whether we have the right to call the yeas and nays or not, but I have
              a reason why 1 think we can have the yeas and nays at any time. It is obvious that a
              proposition' to call the yeas and nays is always in order, for the reason that if it
              is not allowed, the presiding officer might assert a power that does not belong to
              him, There is but one or two things the presiding officer can do, either declare the
              body adjourned on his own volition, or allow the yeas and nays to be called. The voice
              of the majority of the Senate should be received and their votes should be recorded
              for or against this proposition.</p>
            <p>Mr. GOODING. It seems to me the only proper thing to be done is for the chair to
              prorogue this body, as has been suggested. This morning we were in session under the
              Constitution, and there not being a quorum present; a motion was made to adjourn; that
              motion was carried and the adjournment was under the Constitution till to-morrow. Our
              session at this time is clearly a voluntary assemblage, and not a meeting of the
              Senate. It strikes me we are not in a position to entertain a motion to adjourn, or
              call the yeas and nays, but we should simply disperse. I think a call for the yeas and
              nays is out of order. The only proper thing is for the chair to declare that we have
              assembled by mistake, the Senate having adjourned this morning, under the Constitution
              it was adjourned till to-morrow.</p>
            <p>Mr. DITTEMORE. Can the Senator give us an intelligent answer as to when his brethren
              will be in?</p>
            <p>Mr. GOODING. I would refer the gentleman to the Senator from Montgomery who has more
              information on this subject, probably, than any Senator on this floor.</p>
            <p>The PRESIDENT. The Chair is of the opinion that it is not in order to demand the yeas
              and nays at this time. The question is upon the motion to adjourn. As many as are of
              the opinion that the Senate should adjourn will say "aye." [After the response.] Those
              of a contrary opinion will say "no." [After the response, a division being called
              for.] Those voting in the affirmative will please rise.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE. I rise to a point of order. Nobody made a call for a division.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. A division is provided for by the rules, and we have none.</p>
            <p>The PRESIDENT. The Chair will take the vote again upon this question. </p>
            <pb n="279" xml:id="VAA8558-14-279"/>
            <p>Mr. BOONE. I rise to a point of order. As I understand the authorities as they have
              been ably discussed, there is only one thing this body can do. It has to do an
              affirmative thing, and that is to adjourn. It can't refuse to adjourn if I understand
              the authorities. This body not having a quorum will have to adjourn. It can't do a
              negative thing. It can't refuse to adjourn at all;a negative vote counts for
              nothing.</p>
            <p>The PRESIDENT. I believe a division was called for. As many as are of the opinion
              that the Senate should adjourn, will say "'aye." As many as are of a contrary opinion
              say "no." I believe the motion does not prevail.</p>
            <p>So the motion to adjourn was rejected by a viva voce vote.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN demanded a call of the Senate.</p>
            <p>The PRESIDENT directed a call by counties and districts.</p>
            <p>It was taken, and - </p>
            <p>Mr. NEFF, from the county of Randolph, and Mr. Wadge, from the counties of Lake and
              Porter, having appeared since the last call - </p>
            <p>The PRESIDENT reported twenty-eight Senators present and answering to their
              names.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. It is apparent that we cannot get a quorum this afternoon. I think we have
              tried as fully as it can be reasonably expected we should. We have already expended a
              great deal of moral energy in attempting to get a quorum but have failed. For some
              reason or other a good many Senators wha don't belong to the Republican party are not
              here, and for some reason or other some Senators who do belong to the Republican party
              are not here. I do not know why it is so.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS (interposing.) Does the Senator yield the floor ?</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. Yes sir.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. I move that the absentees be sent for.</p>
            <p>The PRESIDENT. The motion is out of order.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. Coming back to where I started: There is no need of staying here any
              longer, and I trust the President of the Senate will exercise the right the
              Constitution reposes in him, and declare the Senate adjourned.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS moved that the Senate adjourn.</p>
            <p>Messrs. Dittemore, Williams and others demanded the yeas and nays, but the President
              declared the motion carried, and that the Senate was adjourned until to-morrow morning
              at ten o'clock.</p>

            <p>The Joint Convention of the two Houses having been duly organized His Excellency
              Governor Conrad Baker delivered his biennial message as follows;</p>
            <p>Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives;</p>
            <p>The hope expressed at the close of the address delivered to you at the commencement
              of the late special session, that your deliberations during that session might be
              characterized by harmony and be fruitful of good legislation, I am happy to say, was
              realized. Since my connection with public affairs, I have never witnessed a session of
              the General Assembly in which a more intelligent appreciation of duty was manifested;
              and in point of industry the late session, in my judgment, excelled any of its
              predecessors. This will not be understood as an idle compliment on the one hand, or as
              an unqualified indorsement of every act that was passed at the late session on the
              other. In welcoming you for the last time to this seat of legislation; I sincerely
              congratulate you in view of what you have already accomplished, and trust that during
              your present session you will be guided by that wisdom which cometh from above, and
              which is profitable to direct.</p>

            <p>If immediate provisions be made, as in my judgment there should be, for the
              enlargement of the House of Refuge, and the Institution for the Education of the
              Blind, and for the completion of the Female Reformatory, the above balance will not
              only be exhausted, but a deficiency will be created of over $100,000. It must be
              remembered that the act providing for the payment of the old bonds already mentioned,
              may add a considerable sum to this deficiency; and it is possible that the 5 and 2 1-2
              per cent, stocks still outstanding to the amount of $36,930.12, or some considerable
              part thereof may be presented for redemption during the current year, and if so, they
              must be paid. </p>
            <p>In view of all this, and of the pressing demand that exists for making increased
              provision for the insane, it will be necessary in my judgment to levy a State tax for
              each of the years 1873 and 1874, of fifteen cents on the $100 of the taxables of the
              State. The collection of the revenue of 1873, will also have to be anticipated by a
              temporary loan, and the commencement of a new Hospital for the Insane will probably
              have to be deferred until the revenue of 1873 can be made available.</p>

            <head rend="center">ATTORNEY GENERAL.</head>
            <p>The duties and responsibilities of the Attorney General ought to be greatly enlarged,
              to the end that his office may be increased in usefulness in a corresponding degree.
              Under existing legislation that officer may reside at the most distant point in the
              State from the capitol, and is not required to have an office or a deputy at
              Indianapolis. The compensation he receives is such as to preclude the idea that he
              should give much of his time to the business of the State, and the result is that such
              business as naturally falls within the scope of his office must be either neglected or
              entrusted to other lawyers at an expense greater for each year than would be expended
              if an adequate salary were allowed to justify and require the residence of the
              Attorney General at the capital, and the giving of his whole time to the duties of the
              office. I therefore respectfully recommend that the law governing the office of the
              Attorney General be so remodeled as to make the following provisions, viz:</p>
            <p>First. That the Attorney General be required to reside at the State Capital and keep
              an office there, and that he shall on all business days, during business hours, be at
              said office in person or by deputy, except when he shall be engaged in court or
              elsewhere in the service of the State.</p>
            <pb n="282" xml:id="VAA8558-14-282"/>
            <p>Second. Requiring him to attend to the State's interests in all actions in which the
              State is interested (criminal prosecutions excepted,) whether the State shall be a
              party to such actions or not, and authorizing the Governor or a majority of the other
              State officers, to direct the Attorney General to perform such duty in any particular
              case.</p>
            <p>Third. Requiring the Attorney General to give his legal opinion to the Governor,
              whenever requested so to do, touching any question or point of law in which the
              interests of the State may be involved, and to any other State officer, touching any
              point or question of law concerning the duty of such officer. Also, to either House of
              the General Assembly as to the constitutionally of any existing or proposed law,
              whenever requested so to do by resolution of such House.</p>
            <p>Fourth. Giving the Attorney General a supervisory care over all the prosecuting and
              district attorneys throughout the State, and requiring the latter to report to the
              former, at stated periods all fines assessed and recognizances forfeited in the
              several courts within their respective circuits and districts, and requiring the
              Attorney General to keep a record of all such fines and forfeitures alphabetically
              arranged by counties, and of the steps taken from time to time for the collection
              thereof. Also, requiring such prosecuting and district attorneys to report to the
              Attorney General from time to time the statistics of crime and criminal prosecutions,
              and of divorces granted and refused by the several courts in their respective circuits
              and districts.</p>
            <p>Fifth. Requiring the Attorney General to report annually to the Secretary of State
              the statistics thus collected.</p>
            <p>Sixth. Authorizing the Attorney General upon the direction of the Governor to appear
              as the prosecuting officer of the State in any criminal prosecution in any court
              within the State, and to assume charge of such prosecution either with or without the
              assistance of the circuit or district prosecutor, and to prosecute the same for and on
              behalf of the State.</p>
            <p>The necessity of some such provision as the one last mentioned is manifest, when it
              is remembered that the Constitution of the State makes it the duty of the Governor "to
              take care that the laws be faithfully executed," but so far as executing or aiding in
              executing the penal laws through the courts is concerned, he is under existing
              legislation, left without means to perform this constitutional duty. If a mob should
              defy the laws of the State and execute lynch law on any portion of the citizens, the
              Governor may call out the power of the State to suppress the violence and restore
              order. But when this is accomplished the prosecution of such violators of the public
              peace can only be carried on through the local prosecuting officers, although these
              officers may be in sympathy with or in fear of the very men to prosecuted. In such
              cases, and in many others, which might be instanced, the Governor, to enable him to
              obey the constitutional injunction before mentioned, ought to have the power to direct
              the chief law officer of the State to appear in any court and assume the prosecution
              of any person charged with crime against the laws of the State.</p>
            <p>Of course the changes above indicated would necessitate a very considerable increase
              in the salary of the Attorney General, but this would be compensated fifty-fold by the
              increase of the school fund by the collection of fines and forfeitures that are lost
              to the State under the present system. The opinion of the Attorney General should also
              be required be given to the Governor as to the propriety or impropriety of remitting
              each fine and forfeiture for the remission of which application may be made. </p>

            <head rend="center">BUREAU OF STATISTICS</head>
            <p>In this connection, I desire to call your special attention to the necessity for the
              establishing of a Bureau of Statistics, in connection with the Secretary of State's
              office. The Governor, and other State officers are, every year and sometimes many
              times in a year, called upon for statistical information by the different departments
              of the General Government, and by the governments of foreign countries, on some or all
              of the subjects usually embraced within the operations of such a Bureau, and are
              subjected to the mortifying necessity of being compelled to reply that Indiana
              collects no statistics, and can, therefore, impart no statistical information. It is
              as preposterous, in this age of the world, to attempt to legislate wisely and well for
              a State and its inhabitants without full statistical information, as it would be to
              conduct extended business operations without keeping an account of bills payable and
              receiveable. I therefore recommend the establishment of a Bureau of Statistics, under
              the supervision of the Secretary of State, and that provision be made in connection
              therewith for encouraging immigration by publishing such statistical information as
              will make known the resources and advantages which this State offers to those in
              search of homes.</p>
            <p>The office of Secretary of State, I will here suggest, ought to be reconstructed by
              dividing it into Bureaus, and allowing an increase clerical force.</p>

            <head rend="center">EDUCATION OF FEEBLE-MINDED AND IDIOTIC CHILDREN.</head>
            <p>There is also an urgent necessity for the establishment of a school for the education
              idiotic and feeble-minded children. The success of such institutions in other States
              places their utility beyond doubt. I would recommend the inauguration of an
              experimental school at a small cost in the first instance, as was done in Illinois,
              feeling assured that the <pb n="283" xml:id="VAA8558-14-283"/> experiment would soon
              demonstrate, as it did in that State, the necessity of a permanent institution for the
              class of children just mentioned. A bill was matured two years ago, but was not
              passed, and I understand that substantially the same bill was again introduced at the
              special session, and is now pending. I trust it will become a law before your session
              shall close. Before dismissing the subject, I desire to call your attention to the
              fact, that the Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb has a tract of land
              containing about thirty-six acres situated south of the Michigan road, which is not
              now and cannot be in the future, necessary for the purposes of that Institution, the
              same being seperated from the grounds on which the buildings of the Institution stand
              by the several railroad tracks. I am informed that this land, if sold for one-fourth
              cash and the residue in four equal annual payments, with interest at six per cent.,
              would bring $75.000. I know of no better purpose to which the proceeds of the surplus
              lands of the Institution for the Deaf and Dumb could be applied than to the founding
              of an institution for the education of idiotic and feeble-minded children. I therefore
              recommend that authority be given to the trustees of the Institution for the Education
              of the Deaf and Dumb to sell the land before mentioned on the terms above indicated,
              and that said trustees before making any sale be required to advertise for sealed bids
              for the land, such bids to be opened in the presence of the Governor, and the sale to
              be subject to his approval. I further recommend that a portion of the proceeds be
              applied, first, to the opening of an experimental school, and that ultimately the
              residue of such proceeds, if the experiment shall be successful, be applied to the
              establishment of the institution on a permament foundation.</p>

              ample opportunity to inform yourselves of the progress which our system of public
              schools has made during the last two years. I am gratified to be able to say, however,
              that one marked evidence of progress is the fact that the average school term has,
              since 1867, been prolonged thirty-three days in the year, and that more than the half
              of this increase in the length of the school year occured in 1872. I commend the
              common school system to your fostering care, feeling assured that popular education is
              a necessary safegaurd of free institutions.</p>

              forfeited the grant, and is liable to be called upon by the General Government to
              refund the amount received. There is no probability that such a demand will be made,
              but it is highly important that the General Assembly should memorialize Congress to
              waive the forfeiture and grant further time to the Trustees of Purdue University in
              which to put the college in orperation. I therefore recommend that a joint resolution

              proposed amendment to the people for ratification, and also in relation to the calling
              of a convention to make a thorough revision of the Constitution ; that is to say: Let
              an act or acts be passed making the following provisions, viz:</p>
            <p>First. For submitting said proposed amendment to the people for ratification, at an
              election to be held on the second Tuesday in October, 1873.</p>
            <p>Second. Providing further for the election, at the same election, of delegates to a
              constitutional convention to revise the Constitution.</p>
            <p>Third. Providing still further, that at the same election the question whether a
              constitutional convention shall be convened or not, shall be submitted to a direct
              vote of the people, and that if a majority of all the votes cast on the question at
              such election shall be in favor of the calling of a convention, then the convention
              shall meet as may be provided for in the act, but that if a majority of said votes
              shall be against a convention, then no convention shall meet in pursuance of the
              provisions of the act, and the election of delegates shall, by reason of such adverse
              vote, become null and void.</p>
            <p>By this plan the expense of but one election would be incurred, and yet all the

            <p>In February, 1871, and just after session of the General Assembly of that years had
              terminated, I received a communication from his Excellency, R. B. Hayes, Governor of
              Ohio, transmitting to me a joint resolution of the General Assembly of the State of
              Ohio in relation to the construction and maintainence of the Wabash and Erie Canal
              within the State of Indiana, and requesting me to communicate the same to the General
              Assembly of this State. I accordingly herewith submit for your consideration the said
              joint resolution, with the letter of Gov. Hayes transmitting it to me.</p>
            <p>I beg leave to say that the Ohio joint resolution assumes the making of a compact or
              stipulation by Indiana to or with Ohio that Indiana would perpetually keep in repair
              and in good navigable order, so much of the Wabash and Erie Canal as is situated in
              Indiana, and calls upon this State to perform the supposed compact. The answer to this
              complaint is that the assumption that such a compact ever existed or was made by
              Indiana, is unsupported by the facts. No such compact ever was unmade by Indiana with
              Ohio. The agreement made in 1820, by Jeremiah Sullivan on the part of this State, and
              Wyllys Silliman on the part of Ohio, recited in the Ohio joint resolu- <pb n="285"
                xml:id="VAA8558-14-285"/>tion, never was ratified by either of said States,and,
              therefore, never took effect or became binding on said States, or either of them. The
              only agreement or arrangement of any kind between the two States is that contained in
              the joint resolution of the General Assembly of Indiana, of February 1, 1834, and in
              the acceptance of the arrangement proposed thereby the joint resolution of Ohio,
              passed February 24, 1834. By the Indiana joint resolution, this State relinquished and
              conveyed to the State of Ohio certain lands ceded to this State by Congress, in
              consideration and on condition that Ohio should construct and keep in repair a canal
              from the Ohio and Indiana line to a point as low down the Maumee river toward Lake
              Erie as the towns of Maumee and Perrysburgh, and in consideration that Ohio should
              perform divers other stipulations contained in the Indiana joint resolution. Ohio, by
              the joint resolution of February 24, 1834 accepted the terms of the Indiana joint
              resolution, and the two joint resolutions contain the only contract made between the
              two States. This contract was wholly an executed contract on the part of Indiana, and
              executory on the part of Ohio; and it was impossible for Indiana ever to be guilty of
              a breach of the contract, because it was wholly executed, as far as she was concerned,
              the moment it was made. I therefore recommend the passage of a joint resolution, in
              response to the Ohio joint resolution of February 21, 1871, respectfully denying the
              existence of any such compact as the one of the supposed breach of which she
              complains.</p>

            <p>The kindness with which you received, and the promptness with which you adopted a few
              suggestions I made in my last message in relation to the journals of the two Houses,
              encourages me to call your attention to another matter of legislative practice, in
              which there is great need of improvement. I allude to the titles of many of the bills
              that are passed from time to time. The impression seems to prevail that because the
              Constitution has declared "that every act shall embrace but one subject and matters
              properly connected therewith, which subject shall be expressed in the title," it
              therefore follows that the titles of bills must be longer than was necessary before
              such a provision existed. Such an impression is altogether incorrect. The principle
              subject, or one of the principal subjects of the act, should be briefly expressed in
              the title, and, this being done, every matter properly connected with the one so
              expressed, can be provided for without being alluded to in the title. Such phrases as
              the following are always unnecessary and, therefore, inelegant and improper in the
              titles of bills, viz: "And to declare an emergency," "and to repeal all laws
              inconsistent therewith," "and matters properly connected therewith," etc., etc. A very
              cursory examination of our legislation for years past, not excluding that of the late
              special session, will satisfy you how sadly our legislative literature is marred by
              the singularly grotesque, inelegant and almost interminable titles that are too often
              prefixed to bills. Not a few of these bills were signed by me as approved, but I want
              it distinctly understood that I reserved the right to protest against such titles. The
              title of one of them passed at the late special session, contains one hundred and
              sixty words, when a perfect title could have been framed in fifteen words. It is
              almost impossible to amend an act with such a title, so as to make the amendatory act
              and its title intelligible. I suggest the propriety of having a joint committee, whose
              duty it shall be to supervise the titles of bills, so that our statute books in the
              future may not be deformed by such titles as those to which allusion is made.</p>

            <head rend="center">INTEMPERANCE.</head>
            <p>The intelligent legislator can not close his eyes to the fact that the intemperant
              use of intoxicating liquors is fearfully prevalent, and that it is the fruitful source
              of pauperism and crime, of social disorder and domestic wretchedness. Nor can it be
              doubted that much the larger share of this intemperance is caused by the existence of
              the numerous places where public tippling is practiced and encouraged for pecuniary
              gain, under the auspices of the State. While it must be conceded that men cannot be
              made virtuous by statuary enactments, it does not follow that schools of vice and
              nurseries of crime ought not to be restrained or suppressed <pb n="286"
                xml:id="VAA8558-14-286"/> to that extent to which public opinion will sustain and
              execute the laws made for that purpose. As Mr. Lincoln said of slavery, so say I of
              tippling houses, namely; If they are not wrong, then nothing is not wrong. Every
              existing wrong can not, however, be overthrown in a day by a mere matter of
              legislative authority, but it does not follow from this that nothing is to be done
              looking or tending to ward such overthrow. The legislation of the State should on this
              subject keep pace with public opinion, and it would be better to have the law a little
              in advance of public opinion than to have it lag far behind. Good laws aid in the
              formation of a healthy opinion, just as an enlightened public opinion aids in the
              formation and execution of good laws. I do not believe in the existence of the power
              or in the expediency of enacting sumptuary laws, but a law which restrains or
              suppresses one tippling house or all the tippling houses in the State, attempts to
              regulate no man's expenditures, nor does it prescribe what he shall eat or what he
              shall drink, or wherewithal he shall be clothed. In one set of public schools we
              educate the children and youth of the State, at the expense of the State, for the
              performance of the duties of American citizenship. In another set of public schools,
              over which mammon presides and in which the State is a partner, we authorize their
              proprietors to undo what the first have done or are doing, and to unfit every citizen
              who will yield to their influence for the performance of these same duties of American
              citizenship. No man who has any faith in human progress can believe that this state of
              affairs can or will always last. The enlightened statesman, remembering that in a
              republic public opinion is the foundation of the laws as well as the mainspring of
              their execution, will ask himself not only what is right, but what is practicable
              under existing circumstances, and will legislate for the right without defeating his
              own intentions by attempting the impracticable. You are fresh from the ranks of the
              people, assembled from all parts of the State, and are much better acquainted with
              public opinion than I am, and should, in my judgment, legislate for the restraint and
              diminution of public tippling houses to the highest point that the existing state of
              public opinion will sustain, so that (as Mr. Lincoln on another occasion said of
              slavery) the public mind may confidently rest in the belief that they are in process
              of ultimate extinction. In my opinion public drunkenness ought to be declared a
              misdemeanor by State law, and punished accordingly.</p>

            <head rend="center">PARDONS.</head>
            <p>I herewith respectfully submit pursuant to the requirements of the Constitution a
              report showing all reprieves, commutations and pardons granted, and another showing
              all fines and forfeitures remitted since the previous report made to the last General
              Assembly two years ago. After no inconsiderable thought and experience in relation to
              the exercise of the pardoning power, I am satisfied that the Governor ought to be
              authorized by law to if-sue revocable pardons, so that the person pardoned may be put
              upon his good behavior and if he relapses into vicious ways, returned to the prison to
              serve out the residue of his sentence. Similiar legislation should be adopted as to
              prisoners confined in the county jail for the non-payment of fines, to the end that
              they may be discharged from imprisonment conditionally, without a remission of their
              fines, and if they prove unworthy of the favor shown then, the discharge may be
              countermanded, and they may be returned to prison. Bills have been prepared and are
              now pending to give effect to these views, and I feel confident that their passage
              would inaugurate not merely a change, but a reform.</p>

          <p> Hon. CHARLES W. CHAPMAN, a Senator for the counties of Kosciusko and Whitley, and the
            Hon. WILLIAM R. HOUGH, a Senator the counties of Henry and Hancock, appeared in their
            seats.</p>
          <p>Mr. DITTEMORE. I rise to a question of privilege. I have been informed that in the
            proceedings of the Joint Convention last Saturday afternoon. I was represented by the
            Secretary as being present and not voting for directors of the northern and southern
            prisons. Such sir, is not the case. If the record of the vote shows that, it is untrue.
            I was not in the Hall of the House of Representatives after the vote for State Librarian
            had taken place, at no time from that time on to the adjournment. For what purpose, sir,
            it was intended to represent me in that light, I do not know.</p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. I would like to ask the Senator if he was not present in the Joint
            Convention, where was he?</p>
          <p>Mr. DITTEMORE. I absented myself, sir, upon my own motion. There is no person to
            prevent my going, and I went away on business that I don't care to make public here.</p>
          <p>The PRESIDENT. I am informed by the Secretary that the Senator is in error. At onetime
            it was thought that he responded to his name, and he was marked as present and voting,
            but on the attention of the Secretary being called to the mistake he changed the records
            in accordance with the facts. After that you are marked as not voting.</p>
          <p>Mr. DITTEMORE. I want to know if I am represented as being present and not voting?</p>
          <p>The PRESIDENT. I don't know.</p>
          <p> Mr. DITTEMORE. In addition I would inquire whether the journal of the Joint Convention
            is here. I desire to have that branch of it read.</p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS raised the point of order that the Senate having already determined that
            the journal shall not be read the motion is out of order.</p>
          <p>Mr. DITTEMORE declared that he was simply making a request and not a motion. He put it
            in the shape of a request that the portion of the journal affecting his vote may be
            read.</p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS objected.</p>
          <p>The PRESIDENT. Objection is made.</p>

              <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
              <p>Mr. CARNAHAN, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: I am
                opposed to taking newspapers from beginning to end; for I know these papers rarely
                ever reach our constituentsat least those living in distant parts of the State; and
                even if they do the proceedings of the Legislature is published in the county
                papers, and the papers sent out from the Legislature are never read. I consider the
                whole thing is for nothing but buncomb; and therefore I am opposed to taking the
                newspapers. Then I am opposed to the proposition for another reason: we have at the
                session heretofore taken papers that did not publish one sentence of the proceedings
                of the Legislature, and if we do that I think we might as well subscribe for every
                paper in the State. I would be glad to have one paper representing each political
                party provided they report our proceedings correctly, but we see that is being done
                in a meagre manner, therefore I am willing to exclude the whole thing. If we want
                papers let us go and buy such as we want.</p>
              <p>Mr. ORR, when his name was called, said: By way of explanation I must say that as I
                understand the details of the bill I differ with the report of the committee. I
                can't conceive for a moment that newspapers are embraced in the word "stationery"
                and I agree with my friend the Senator from Posey [Mr. Carnahan] not to take any of
                the papers that publish none of the proceedings of this body. I think we are doing
                violence to strict economy by taking newspapers that do not report the proceedings
                of this Senate; but I believe we should send to our constituents newspapers
                containing our action. I believe it would be acting right to take the papers of this
                city publishing our proceedings and send them to our constituents, so I shall have
                to vote to lay the report on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. SCOTT, when his name was called, said: In explanation of my vote I will say
                that I admit it requires a liberal construction to include newspapers in the word
                "stationery" and the Committee is fully justified in assuming that position. I think
                our report is right for it don't require any greater stretch of imagi-ation to call
                newspapers stationery, than to say that soft soap is stationery, and blacking, and
                looking-glasses, and towels. I wonld be glad to have newspapers myself but lawfully
                and properly I don't expect to have any. All these little perquisites voted
                heretofore I understand was cut off by the bill passed last session. I did not
                understand that when we voted to refuse to supply ourselves with stationery as
                individuals, we meant to refuse to supply ourselves with stationery as a Senate.
                Newspapers are a matter for our own private finances. A subscription for them don't
                help the State any that I know of. For that reason I am opposed to laying this
                resolution on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. SLATER, when his name was called in explanation of his vote said it would take
                a very liberal construction of this law to say that newspapers are stationery. At
                the time this law was under consideration some Senator moved to include newspapers,
                and it was voted down.</p>
              <p>Mr. STEELE, in explanation of his vote when his name was called said: Our people
                want papers as far as I have conversed with them. It can't be claimed that members
                desire these papers folded and stamped because they make any use of them except to
                send them broadcast over the country. The taxpayers in my county desire this to be
                done. It is at their expense and I don't think we should deny them. I will vote for
                no other kind than those prepared to be sent out; though I don't think papers are
                stationery.</p>
              <p>The vote was then announced as above recorded - yeas 23, nays 15.Mr. BROWN moved to
                reconsider the vote just taken and to lay this motion on the table.</p>
              <p>The latter motion was agreed to by yeas, 21: nays, 19.</p>
              <p>Mr. WADGE attempted to offer a resolution but the point was raised by Mr. Dwiggins
                that it was put of order, and the Chair sustained the point.</p>
              <p>Mr. BROWN then moved that the rules be suspended for the reception of the
                resolution, which prevailed and the resolution was handed to the Secretary.</p>
              <p>Mr. DWIGGINS moved to adjourn.</p>
              <p>Mr. PRESIDENT Friedley, [Mr. Daggy in the Chair,] raised the point of order that
                the motion was out of order, as the resolution was already in the hands of the
                Secretary.</p>
              <p>The Chair overruled the point. The Senate refused to adjourn by yeas 13, nays
                23.</p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN moved to amend the substitute by striking out the work "two" and

              <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
              <p>Mr. DWIGGINS, when his name was called in explanation of his vote said: This is but
                an opening wedge. The law passed last session includes postage stamps, and if we are
                going to pass a law one day and violate it the next, what respect will the people
                have for this legislature? Senators have got their three dollars a day extra and let
                them buy their papers. I am opposed to making a record by passing a law saying we
                shall not have postage stamps and then turn round and take them. The papers which
                are sent away by Senators do not reach their constituents until they are stale. By
                the adoption of this resolution, Senators will appropriate to themselves 8 cents
                worth of postage stamps each day. This was but the opening wedge to further evasions
                of the law.</p>
              <p>Mr. WADGE rose to a question of privilege. He desired to know whether when the
                gentleman spoke of the opening wedge, he meant any personal allusion to him. If so,
                he wanted the words taken down. [Laughter.]</p>
              <p>Mr. GREGG, when his name was called in explanation of his vote said: I think I have
                promised my people all the papers this resolution will call for and more too. I
                shall vote for this resolution and accept the construction given by the Senator from
                Jackson [Mr. Brown,] that I vote them for my constituents: for I know they desire to
                have the papers and read the proceedings. I do not believe the news in these papers
                is very valuable, but I do think the report of the doings of the General Assembly is
                valuable to the people. It has long been the custom to subscribe for these papers
                and I have always voted for them with the understanding that it was in part
                consideration of a proper report of our proceedings ; not in the few papers sent out
                from this hall but in the papers run off and sent out by these publishers. If we cut
                them off, these papers would use their own pleasure as to what kind of a report they
                will make.</p>
              <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. (interposing.) I would like to know if these subscriptions influence
                the reports at all.</p>
              <p>Mr. GREGG. I am making a statement of what I believe to be the fact. If we
                compensate these newspaper men so they give a full report of our proceedings the
                thousands of papers they send out communicate to every quarter of the State every
                act we do. And it is a wholesome and proper restraint upon our action. I believe the
                amount of money will be richly repaid to the people in the way of wholesome
                restraint.</p>
              <p>Mr. HARNEY in explanation of his vote when his name was called said: This is
                nothing more than a largess to newspapers. What does a few papers amount to
                distributed over the State by members here? They are distributed as a kind of a
                memento. I have thought this session would be the proper time to change the
                precedent. We have for many years had the <hi rend="sc">BREVIER REPORTS</hi> - if
                they could be circulated over the State they would be much more effective. I would
                prefer waiting for the Committee appointed on that subject to report whether it is
                not practical to have the BREVIER REPORTS printed and circulated as these papers.
                Several years ago the papers of this city published something like a full page of
                proceedings every day but it has now got down to about a column a day. The reports
                for the papers published in Cincinnati are almost as full as the press of this city,
                which print merely a few items drawn along, some of them mere caricatures. Unless
                there is to be an understanding between the reporters and these papers as to how
                much they will report, and what they will report and the relation they bear to the
                House, I think it improper to extend a largess to these papers. I cannot see that
                the interests of our constituencies are subserved by sending out the few reports
                made in these papers. The whole thing in my opinion amounts to giving away that much
                to the papers. Those who are in the habit of reading do not depend upon the papers
                we send out for their information. He was in favor of having the <hi rend="sc"
                  >BREVIER REPORTS</hi> printed and circulated from day to day.</p>
              <pb n="290" xml:id="VAA8558-14-290"/>
              <p>Mr. ORR, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: I don't admit
                that newspapers and stamps are stationery, yet there is something in this matter I
                don't like. There is no doubt but what we take these papers for a single object for
                electioneering purposes, as has been intimated; and I think if we take the papers we
                should pay for them. I think the stamp proposition is wrong, and I believe I would
                vote for the resolution if it didn't have postage stamps in it.</p>
              <p>Mr. RHODES, in his explanation of his vote when his name was called said: I thought
                I should vote against the taking of newspapers, and I would now vote against taking
                newspapers for myself. As far as any desire I have to read them for my own
                information is concerned, I am willing to buy them; but this proposition is that
                this Senate shall purchase eight copies a day of the two leading journals that
                publish our proceedings at length for the purpose of distributing them to the people
                of the State. I believe that is right. I am inclined to think our constituents are
                suspicious of us since we have voted ourselves eight dollars a day; and if we keep
                them from reading our proceedings, I fear we will not raise ourselves in their
                estimation. Gentlemen say 8 copies will impart a small amount of information to the
                people. Now I sent these papers to postmasters throughout my district. There is not
                a neighborhood in the State but what has a postoffice and if the P. M., does his
                duty when he receives these papers those gentlemen who come there can ascertain what
                is going on here. The people can be reached in that way with fewer number of copies
                than is supposed by many.</p>
              <p>Mr. SCOTT, when his name was called in explanation of his vote said: On the ground
                Senators take, the resolution is certainly wrong for the simple reason that while I
                have 40,000 people in my district, other Senators have only 10,000 and so I ought to
                have four times as many papers. It is not a fair divide, don't you see? It is a
                little too homoeopathic. Here are four papers only for 10,000 people. What a farce
                this thing is, the idea of voting information to our constituents! Now I'd like to
                know if we can't find better ground than that? I would be willing to go before my
                people saying I voted for laying on my desk a paper printing the proceedings of this
                body, but were I to say that voted for four papers for 40,000 people, every man
                would laugh at me. I say we disregard the construction ot the law entirely. I would
                like to have two papers but I don't want any more.</p>
              <p>Mr. STEELE, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote was understood to
                say that he would not vote to lay these papers on the desks of Senators for their
                own use, but if Senators wanted to send them away he was willing to vote them for
                that purpose. In his neighborhood the papers were taken by prominent men and the
                people gathered in little groups and the papers were passed from one to another, so
                that many read the same copy.</p>
              <p>Mr. WADGE, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said he had
                received many letters from his constituents to whom he had sent these papers, which
                letters contained suggestions that were of great service to him. He was not voting
                these papers for himself but for the people he represented here.</p>
              <p>Mr. CARNAHAN, after hearing the explanation of votes on both sides desired his name
                to be again called that he might change his vote.</p>
              <p>The result of the vote was then announced as above recorded.</p>
              <p>The substitute as amended was then agreed to by yeas 22, nays 18 - as follows;</p>

          <p>On motion of Mr. GIVAN, Mr. Cauthorn resolution for amemdment of rule 38 so as to give

            Committees was taken up.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. The rule has stood from time immemorial that seven shall be the number of
            the Standing Committess, and he could see no good reason for increasing the number. And
            he was unwilling to place this power in the hands of the Speaker - having no reference
            to the present Speaker - but he considered that it ought not to be done.</p>

            <p>Mr. TROUTMAN submitted a preamble and resolution reciting that the new assessment act
              gives the work of the assessment of taxes to the real estate appraiser, and resolving
              therefore that the real estate appraisers be requested to appoint the former assessors
              for deputies, without respect to their partizan affiliations.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. They might well appoint such for their deputies as may be competent; but
              we all know that the people elect a great many incompetents. The resolution can be so
              shaped, that wherever they are competent the old Assessors shall be appointed as
              deputies, and it should be made the duty of the appraisers to appoint them.</p>
            <p>Mr. TROUTMAN had that object in view; and if the resolution does not express it, he
              hoped the gentleman would prepare the proper amendment.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. It might be worded so as not to carry it too far into the future - so as
              toconfine these appointments to the present and the next year.</p>
            <p> Mr. BUTTERWORTH submitted an in effectual motion to lay the resolution on the
              table.</p>
            <p>Mr. MILLER suggested another amendment of the resolution. It comtemplates this
              deputizing of all the old Assessors. Perhaps the appraisers would not require so many
              deputies.</p>
            <p>Mr. TROUTMAM. I would like to inquire whether it is competent for this House to
              request or instruct in this way?</p>
            <p>Mr. COBB. It seems to me that this resolution is entirely out of order - infringing
              and patching up a law we have but just passed.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRETT. If we go to tampering with the assessment law we will get everything out
              of joint.</p>
            <p>The resolution was adopted on a division affirmative 40, negative 30.</p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN moved to amend by inserting after the words newspapers the words "for the

              <p>Mr. DITTEMORE thought the House displayed a great deal of cheek in presuming to
                dictate to this end of the capitol in this matter. They could very cheerfully last
                session vote themselves fifty dollars worth each of stationery and stamps, amounting
                to some $5,000, and it comes with a very bad grace from them to declare that this
                body shall not incur an expense of eight or nine hundred dollars for newspapers.</p>
              <p>Mr. BROWN thought this was a matter which each house was competent to settle for
                itself, and without interference by the other.</p>
              <p>Mr. DWIGGINS moved as a substitute for the amendment, to insert after the word
                "Resolved" these words, "by the House of Representatives, the Senate concuring
                therein," and also to strike out the words "this House" and insert "neither the
                House nor the Senate."</p>
              <p>Mr. GLESSNER moved to lay the substitute on the table.</p>
              <p>It was laid on the table by a vote of 26 to 19.</p>
              <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
              <p>Mr. BROWN, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: Several days
                ago the House of Representatives placed a construction on the <hi rend="i">per
                  diem</hi> act, that it was not lawful under it to purchase newspapers for members
                at the expense of the State, and last evening we placed a construction on that<hi
                  rend="i">per diem</hi> law entirely different. We said, and I think showed sense
                and wisdom by it, that newspapers are not a subject embraced within <pb n="293"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-14-293"/> the meaning of the word "stationery." Now that the House
                of Representatives finds the Senate's construction is different from that of the
                House it comes in and tells us that it wants us to understand distinctly that it
                will vote for no appropriation for these papers. For one I shall not stand dictation
                coming from the House of Representatives or anywhere else.</p>
              <p>Mr. DWIGGINS, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said : This
                resolution comes from the House of Representatives as a request, and it is nothing
                more than a request. I think the Senator from Jackson, [Mr. Brown,] does the House
                great injustice. It is composed of Hon. gentlemen, representing the interests of the
                State. It has sent over here in a proper manner a resolution couched in proper terms
                and carefully worded. Now the postage stamps that go on these papers the Senate
                voted to contract for yesterday afternoon will amount to $244; but Senators say we
                are voting these postage stamps to our constituents and not to ourselves. Here is a
                law in which it is provided that Senators shall not vote postage stamps to
                themselves. I want to know if I have a right to ask that the Senate shall vote to
                one of my constituents a house and lot? Certainly not. Then by what right if we
                can't vote a thousand dollar house and lot to one of my constituents, can we vote to
                our constituents our share of postage stamps? We have a statute providing that we
                shall not vote these postage stamps and yet we go on and vote them! If we do that
                what kind of respect will the people of the State have for the enactments of this
                Legislature, when they see us violating our own acts ourselves? We have said we will
                not vote any money to pay for postage stamps by solemn act of this body at the last
                session, and I am therefore opposed to it.</p>
              <p>Mr. FULLER, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I desire to
                say that I wan't to carry out in good faith all the laws passed at the last session,
                and therefore I vote "no" on this question.</p>
              <p>Mr. GLESSNER, when his name was called, said: I desire to say a word in explanation
                of my vote. I believe every Senator will agree with me that it is better for the
                Senate to do no foolish thing. If we pass this resolution it would be a useless
                thing. This Senate would be saying that it will make no appropriation to pay for
                newspapers contracted for on a previous day. Yesterday the Senate by solemn act
                passed a resolution directing the doorkeeper of the Senate to procure a certain
                number of newspapers to be distributed by Senators. That resolution was duly
                canvassed and adopted, and newspapers in pursuance of h at resolution have been
                furnished to the Senate. Now will we say by a resolution passed to-day that we will
                make no provision for the payment for newspapers furnished under this former
                contract? I know that this Senate will not do that. I know that the Senate will at
                the proper time through its presiding officer, take the necessary steps to carry out
                this contract in good faith; then to adopt this substitute intimating that the
                Senate will not do so, is saying to the country and to ourselves a thing we do not
                intend to do. Indeed it would be repudiation - it would be repudiating a contract we
                made solemnly when understanding ourselves and in a contract we have in part
                received the consideration for. It was the understanding of members of the Senate
                yesterday when the resolution for these papers was adopted that it was not an
                evasion of the law, neither was it obnoxious to the provision of the law. It was to
                furnish copies of the proceedings of this Legislature to the people out of whose
                pockets the expenses of legislation is paid. It was passed for the benefit of the
                men who furnish the money to pay for it. I don't see how any Senator can put a
                construction upon this law that we are appropriating a certain sum of money for our
                own benefit; it is for the benefit of the people from whom the mone} is derived.</p>
              <p>Mr. GREGG, when his name was called, said: I want to give one reason in explanation
                of my vote. I understand the opposition to an appropriation for newspapers is based
                upon the theory that it is in violation of a law passed during the special session,
                the language of that law being that we will not appropriate any stationery to
                ourselves. Now, Mr. President I do not want to cast a vote in violation of law, and
                I won't do that thing if I know how to avoid it. In making up my mind on the subject
                I have to give to it the construction I think the law justly bears. In arriving at
                the proper construction of the law as to whether newspapers are stationery, I need
                but cite the practice and custom of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Now
                I undertake to say it has been decided at every session of the General Assembly by a
                fair construction of other acts that newspapers compose no part of stationery. Last
                session we passed a resolution oppropriating $20 worth of stationery to each
                Senator, and there was not a single Senator who believed that newspapers were a part
                of his stationery, for surely he drew all the stationery, and had the newspapers
                with stamps on them in addition; neither did the members of the House of
                Representatives put the construction upon the $50 worth of stationery, that they
                were to pay for their papers out of that $50. As to the question of stamps we do not
                appropriate the stamps on these newspapers, we simply appropriate the newspapers
                stamped. The newspaper men fold and stamp the papers, and we take the papers folded
                and stamped, and that never has been included in the stationery account in either
                branch of the Legislature; therefore I conclude it is no violation of this law and I
                vote "aye."</p>

              <p>Mr. HARNEY, when his name was called, made an explanation which was not heard at
                this Reporter's table. He held to a strict construction of the law and voted
                "no."</p>
              <p>Mr. HOUGH, when his name was called, said: I don't want to consume the time of the
                Senate in making unnecessary explanations, but, desire to give some reasons for my
                vote. I do not understand that the resolution of the House of Representatives is
                intended to intimidate us. I understand there is a legal reason why we ought not and
                cannot pass that resolution, and why we ought not and cannot vote for the amendment
                offered by the Senator from Jasper [Mr. Dwiggins,] on yesterday. I voted from the
                beginning with those who voted against taking the papers, and I should again if that
                question were an open one, but the sense of this body was evidenced by the passage
                of a resolution authorizing the doorkeeper to make a contract for newspapers, and
                that resolution stands now upon a motion to reconsider. I understand that we can do
                nothing inconsistent with that act during this session, and the only manner in which
                we can undo that thing is upon a motion to reconsider. [In reply to an inquiry by
                Mr. Chapman, he said :] It does not matter whether a contract has been made or
                not.</p>
              <p>The PRESIDENT, [interposing.] With the permission of the Senator I will say that
                the contract has been made.</p>
              <p>Mr. HOUGH. Can we reconsider that resolution? I think not. Can we concur in the
                resolution sent here by the House of Representatives without acting inconsistently
                with the resolution we adopted yesterday? I think not. And I shall vote to table the
                substitute in order to have the resolution from the House in its original shape so
                that we may return it, advising them that we cannot concur therein for the reason
                that on yesterday we adopted a resolution inconsistent with it.</p>
              <p>Mr. NEFF, in explanation of his vote when his name was call said: I was not here
                yesterday when the Senate voted to take these papers, if I had been I would have
                voted against subscribing or making a contract for them. I believe it was understood
                generally amongst Senators when the per diem bill was passed, and used as one of the
                arguments for its passage, that it would cut off statutes, newspapers, postage
                stamps, paper, pens and ink, and everything that members have been heretofore
                getting in lieu of a competent salary for their services. I do not believe, as some
                Senators believe, that the House of Representatives in sending in the resolution we
                are now acting upon intended it as a menace, or as a threat that unless this body
                undid what it did on yesterday the House would refuse to vote to pay for papers that
                this body has ordered. As far as relates to the contract by the doorkeeper it
                matters not whether he has a contract with them or not. We have an undoubted right
                after voting to take papers, at a subsequent time to say we will take them no
                longer. I don't understand that a contract made yesterday is perpetual, but I
                understand that this body can at any time during its session change its action in
                reference to that matter. I am opposed to taking these papers for the good reason
                that they are used for the purpose of advancing our own interests and not the
                interests of the people. I know Senators say we should take the papers in order that
                our constituents may be advised of what we are doing. In my county there are 5,200
                voters and suppose I should send eight copies of these papers a day to my
                constituents, how many of them would ascertain what I have been doing? 8 out of the
                5,200 would get the knowledge and the balance of the 5,200 would have no idea unless
                they took the papers for themselves. It is unjust to make the many pay for papers
                for the benefit of a few. And who do we send them to? To the wealthy men, and the
                influential men - men who will advance our personal interests - and not to the poor
                men who are unable to take them. I am opposed to that kind of a thing. Besides,
                unless you send these 8 papers to eight persons all the time, they can get no
                knowledge of the legislation going on. Send a paper to A today, and B to-morrow, and
                what knowledge can they get? None whatever.</p>
              <p>The PRESIDENT, [interposing.] The Chair will inform the Senator from Randolph [Mr.
                Neff,] that the question is upon paying for papers and not on the propriety of
                taking them.</p>
              <p>Mr. NEFF. These reasons I think are sufficient to govern me in voting against
                laying this motion on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. ORR, in explanation of his vote, said he did not believe the House designed any
                disrespect in sending over this resolution. The other end of the capitol has put a
                different meaning upon the bill passed last session from the Senate, for the Senate
                has decided that newspapers stamped or newspapers without stamps is not stationery.
                I conceive we have no more right to vote ourselves newspapers stamped than we have
                to vote ourselves gold watches or gold headed canes.</p>
              <p>Mr. WILLIAMS made the point of order that this debate is not of the character
                recognized by parliamentary law. No reference should be made to the action of the
                other House.</p>
              <p>The PRESIDENT. The point of order is well taken.</p>
              <p>Mr. ORR. Under the circumstances I shall vote "no."</p>
              <p>Mr. SLEETH, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said: I did not
                have an opportunity to vote upon this question yesterday. It is enough for me to
                know <pb n="295" xml:id="VAA8558-14-295"/> BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.295that a
                majority of this Senate passed a resolution to take a certain number of these papers
                at a certain price. That proposition has been accepted by the newspaper
                establishments and they have entered upon a compliance with the contract. I could
                not regard it other than dishonest and dishonorable having got part of the
                consideration to break the contract. Though I should have voted against the
                proposition yesterday, for these reasons I vote "aye" now.</p>
              <p>Mr. STEELE, when his name was called, said: I made the motion to take up this
                matter in order that Senators who were complaining of not being present yesterday
                might have an opportunity of recording their votes for or against the proposition.
                In addition to that I have signified that I am willing to concur in resolution of
                the House from the fact that I do not consider it a reflection upon the Senate. But
                with this amendment we are asked to say that we will not pay for papers we have
                received. Shall we do it gentlemen? If we receive papers are we not under obligation
                to pay for these papers that we have ordered to be laid on our tables? If we are we
                should not vote for this amendment because it declares in general terms that we will
                not pay for papers furnished.</p>
              <p>Mr. NEFF. [interposing.] Was it not a subscription from day to day?</p>
              <p>Mr. STEELE. I do not understand that to be the force of the contract. I think the
                amendment should go to the table. I vote "aye."</p>
              <p>Mr. WADGE, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said: I shall vote
                to lay upon the table if for no other reason than that I do not recognize the right
                of the House of Representatives to send a resolution in here saying what position we
                shall take and what we shall not. I look upon it as almost amounting to presumption
                on their part to send in a resolution of that character. From a body of men who have
                for 40 days voted themselves $50 worth of stationery, while the Senate voted $20
                worth, it comes with poor grace. I protest against it.</p>
              <p>The vote was then announced - yeas 26; nays 19 - as above recorded.</p>
              <p>So the substitute amendment was laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. BROWN then withdrew his amendment, and moved that the Senate respectfully
                refuse to concur in the House resolution. He subsequently withdrew this motion, and
                the vote was taken directly on the question of concurrence, resulting, yeas 18, nays
                26. So the resolution was not concurred in.</p>
              <p>The Senate then took a recess until two o'clock. </p>

            <p>The bill [S. 9.] to fix the salaries of Judges, being the special order for two
              o'clock, was taken up and the minority and majority reports of the committee were
              read.</p>
            <p>Mr. ORR thought the salaries of the Judges should not be fixed until the
              redistricting bill had been disposed of. He moved that the reports lie on the table,
              but withheld the motion for - </p>
            <p>Mr. RHODES. It seems to me it is taking the direction of childs play for us to make
              this bill the special order from time to time, and then whenever the time arrives, to
              postpone it again. I apprehend if the Legislature at this session should change the
              Judicial districts it would not affect this question as to whether the salaries of
              judges ought to be increased or not. I apprehend if the committee on that subject
              shall redistrict the State they will give the judges all the work they can do. This is
              a reform that is needed, for it is plain that in certain districts of the State the
              judges are idle part of the time and in other districts they are over-worked. They
              should all be employed as much of the time as is proper under the circumstances : and
              if that is done we are prepared now to say what the services of judges are worth. If
              that is done it seems to me it is entirely unimportant whether the State is
              redistricted or not at this session.</p>
            <p>Mr. R. did not see the necessity for postponing the measure. The majority of the
              committee had fixed upon the sums which they deemed proper and necessary to secure the
              services of competent men, and that report ought to be adopted. When the State is
              redistricted it will be easy to so arrange the districts as that each Judge shall sit
              a reasonable length of time each year; but that was a seperate matter, and it did not
              affect the question of doing justice to the judges.</p>
            <p>Mr. BOONE. The Senate at the last session ordered the issuing of a circular letter to
              the clerks of courts requesting information regarding the business of the courts.
              There has been no answer to these letters, but we suppose there will be in a few days.
              It is an easy matter to increase the number of judges, but I imagine to diminish the
              number of judges will not be so easy a matter. While we may have the power it will be
              difficult for Senators and Representatives to exercise that authority against their
              friends. I could vote upon the Supreme Court question before receiving the information
              called for, but I feel that I would not be able to vote intelligently on the entire
              question presented in this bill. And I imagine other Senators are in the same
              condition. I desire that all the Judges shall be well paid and that they should have a
              compensation corresponding with the amount of business they are called upon to
              transact. There is no use in my judgment, in acting upon this matter hastily. We do
              too much business hastily.</p>
            <pb n="297" xml:id="VAA8558-14-297"/>
            <p>Mr. B., was in favor of a postponement of the question until the information which
              was requested of the clerks of courts was received, and the State was
              redistricted.</p>
            <p>Mr. ORR'S motion which had been temporarily withdrawn, was renewed and carried.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Brown, the bill was taken from the table and read the second
              time.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE moved that it be inferred to a committee of three with instructions to
              report a bill fixing the salaries of the Supreme Judges alone.</p>
            <p>Mr. GLESSNER. I am opposed to this motion. Lawyers all agree that a cheap judiciary
              above all other things is to be avoided, and my judgment is that the bane of the
              present system has been a want of compensation on the part of judges. Some Senators
              say that whenever a bill is introduced to equalize the burdens of judges throughout
              the State, then they are willing to vote for a higher compensation. Is not that
              argument a bad one? Isn't the reverse true? Is it not our duty to raise the salaries
              to a fair and just compensation and then redistrict the State so as to equalize the
              burdens and give to each judge 35 or 40 weeks labor to perform during the year? We
              expected to raise these salaries two years ago, but there was an early adjournment of
              the Legislature and it was defeated. Some judges have five or six counties in their
              districts, and are they to be required to still perform their duties for the meagre
              compensation they are now receiving; when we all say the number of circuits ought to
              be increased; and all admit that the people are demanding it? Shall we require these
              men to labor for yet another two years at this mere pittance, because the judge of
              some other district has not labor enough assigned to him to require his entire time?
              Senators will recollect that two years ago from many counties throughout the State
              petitions were coming in asking that the General Assembly increase the compensation of
              the judges throughout the State. Governor Baker in his last message to the Legislature
              suggested the propriety and urged the necessity of increasing the compensation of
              judges throughout the State. Governor Hendricks but yesterday called the attention of
              the General Assembly to the same thing, and called our attention to the fact that a
              cheap judiciary was a thing we should avoid; we should raise the compensation of
              judges to a standard that would call out the best men we have in the State for that
              position. When we all admit that the compensation is not what it should be, why do we
              hesitate? Why now seek to avoid meeting this demand by further delaying the passage of
              this bill?</p>
            <p>Mr. G. was in favor of the passage of the bill in its original shape. Very many of
              the judges throughout the State are underpaid, and simple justice demands that the
              deficiency be supplied at once. While he was in favor of increasing the salaries of
              the Supreme Court, he was still more in favor of increasing the compensation of the
              judges of the Circuit and Common Pleas courts. The State could then be redistricted,
              the labors of the judges equalized, and the number of districts decreased.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE. What harm can there be in seperating the bill in the way proposed? If it
              is settled in our minds that the salary of the Supreme Judges should be increased, why
              not enact the law at once? In the committee I believe I favored the highest amount
              placed in the bill, stating at the time that we desired the best talent in the country
              and in order to obtain that talent we must pay the price that would induce legal
              gentlemen to quit their practice and attend to the matters incident to the calling of
              a judge. I am prepared to vote for an increase of salaries to all the judges. Other
              Senators appear not to have their minds fully made up as to all the judges. For the
              purpose of giving them further time, I propose to seperate this bill and pass now upon
              the question of increasing the salaries of Supreme Judges.</p>
            <p>Mr. HARNEY. I am in favor of the proposition to increase the salaries of the Supreme
              Judges. It is evident that there are many Senators not yet ready to vote for an
              increase of salaries of the inferior judges, and for that reason I am in favor of
              seperating this bill. If it be the pleasure of the Senate I will now introduce a bill
              to increase the salaries of Supreme Judges to $5,000 a year. [Objection being made, he
              withheld it.]</p>
            <p>Mr. BOONE moved to postpone the further consideration of the matter until Wednesday
              of next week at 10:30 A. M.</p>
            <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>

            <p> The SPEAKER announced the Special Order; and Mr. BILLINGSLEY from the
                <orgName>Committee on Printing</orgName>, (under a special order of the House)
              returned Mr. Shirley's bill [H. R. 9.] to abolish the office of Public Printer, With
              an amendment by substitute. He also returned Mr. Shirley's bill [H. R. 31] to provide
              for the Public Printing, by contract without recommendation.</p>
            <p>Mr. FURNAS, from the Special Committee thereon, returned Mr. Billingsley's bill [H.
              R. 290] entitled an act Fixing the time and Mode of electing the State Printer,
              Repealing all Laws Conflicting therewith, and Declaring an Emergency - the question
              being on the second reading thereof.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. I have but recently had a conversation with the Chairman of the
                <orgName>Committee on Printing</orgName>, (Mr. Billingsley,] and whilst I have been
              willing to indulge him in his preference to consider these propositions together, I am
              anxious also for the vote on the final passage of this bill No. 9, to abolish the
              Printer's office, and before we come to the consideration of the bill No. 290, and my
              bill, No. 31, just now reported upon. Sir, it has been whispered round outside of this
              Hall, and all over the State, that the House of Representatives have yielded their
              opposition to the Printers' office. I say then, that it is due to ourselves, on both
              sides, that we should have the privilege of voting upon this question. I would not say
              anything in the spirit of unkindness toward the <orgName>Committee on
                Printing</orgName>, but there were two resolutions passed this House during the
              extra session requiring that Committee to report those bills, numbered 9 and 31 to the
              House - the one abolishing the office and the other providing for the printing (by
              contract, and the Committee paid little attention to the instructions. I wish the
              House to either sustain these bills or reject them. I have been myself all the time
              prepared to vote on them; and I am unwilling that this matter should be put off any
              longer. Yet to accommodate gentlemen I have consented that the whole matter may be
              made the special order for Thursday at 2 o'clock. I have consented to this while I am
              myself ready now and anxious for the action. I want to place myself on the record to
              this effect: that the office of State Printer shall not be any longer tolerated on the
              statute books. I shall not say anything now at length; but when the matter shall come
              up on Thursday, I may desire to have a hearing.</p>
            <p>Mr. GIVAN. It seems to me that this important matter should not hastily be passed
              upon. I therefore move that this bill. [Mr. Shirley's H. R. No. 31,] be laid on the
              table and two hundred copies printed.</p>
            <p>Mr. HELLER. This bill comes to us from the last session. It was referred to the
              Committee on Printing of which I was a member, and when we met for its consideration
              there <pb n="299" xml:id="VAA8558-14-299"/> were none of the Committee present except
              the Chairman and the Democratic members - perhaps not a quorum - but we told the
              Chairman to report the bill. But when the Chairman was called upon to report, he told
              the House that a majority of the Committee had instructed him to withhold the bill. I
              was, myself earnestly in favor of abolishing the Printers' office - and in favor of
              this bill to print by contract; and all I wish to do now is to clear my skirts
              distinctly of all imputations about killing those bills of the gentleman from Morgan
              and Johnson [Mr. Shirley,] by holding them in the Committee. I hope, as that gentleman
              has already said, that when these bills shall come up, they may be justly and fully
              considered.</p>
            <p>Mr. FURNAS, from the <orgName>Committee on Printing</orgName> (by consent) returned
              Mr. Billingsley's bill, [H. R. 290,] fixing the time of the election of Public
              Printer, etc., recommending its passage.</p>
            <p>Mr. BILLINGSLEY moved that it be printed.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. I hope the motion of, the gentleman from Dearborn [Mr. Givan,] will not
              prevail. Now sir, you have three distinct propositions before the House. One of them
              is to abolish the office of State Printer, and if that office is abolished you want to
              provide for the public printing in a different way. It is not necessary to pretend to
              consider either of those other bills till you determine the question whether or not
              you will continue the office of the Printer, and we could have done this as well at
              the last session as now. I think the question of abolishing the office is the only one
              we ought to consider now; and this calls up the question how we will provide for the
              public printing. But if all the subjects come up at once and we proceed to act upon
              them together, and then, if afterwards, the House should determine to abolish the
              office of Printer, the former labor will be useless. But when this first question
              shall be disposed of we can naturally and easily make such disposition of the other
              questions as shall be proper and right. I move that we take up the bill No. 9 and
              decide upon it now.</p>
            <p>Mr. BILLINGSLEY. The reason why I desire that the House should not now take action on
              the bill No. 9 is this: I want the whole question should have a full discussion. I
              think before we abolish the Printer's office we should have something to put in its
              place that we should, at least understand what is the best system of printing for the
              State to adopt. If it should be determined to let the printing by contract to the
              lowest bidder, then it would be best to abolish the office. But if not, then it would
              be best to amend the system under which the State printing has proceeded
              heretofore.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. It seems to me that the motion to print takes precedent of the motion of
              the gentleman from Jefferson, [Mr. Branham.] I do not think there is one member of the
              House who really wants to continue the old law. I think all of us will go for its
              repeal. Then the gentleman from Marion [Mr. Billingsley,] proposes to make another
              bill and place the State Printer under new restrictions; and the gentleman from Morgan
              and Johnson, [Mr. Shirley,] has already provided a bill which proposes that the
              printing shall be done by contract. I think the repealing ought to be done first: then
              the consideration comes fairly on the other questions whether we have another State
              Printer, or whether the printing be done by contract; and I can see either plan may be
              adopted by the House and a law proposed upon it so that the public interests may be
              well gaurded. A public printer is like most any other man; and I believe that a bill
              can be prepared so as to throw a discreet protection around that office. The thing is
              to have a law that shall protect the public interest ; and I shall support whatever
              bill may seem to me best calculated to secure that interest.</p>
            <p>Mr. MELLETT. The gentleman has spoken my mind. But as to repealing the old law
              without providing for the public printing - (and I think there is no question that
              every member desires the repeal of the old law,) it seems to me that there should be
              some provision made first for the public printing. The new method proposed might
              result in great public hardships; therefore we should have all the bills before the
              Houseall the different methods by which we propose to do the public printing - and
              then consider them fully. We should substitute the new officer and prescribe his
              duties, before we abolish the present office.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN, [interposing.] I believe the present official term of the public printer
              expires on the 23rd of this month; therefore I think it ought to be abolished at once
              in order that all the arrangements may be completed by that time.</p>
            <p>Mr. MELLETT. I am certainly in favor of the earliest time possible for the just
              settlement of this matter. I was, myself, on the printing committee, and that
              committee was waiting for bills to come before the House which might embrace
              everything that ought to be considered in that connection; for we could see nothing to
              be gained by abolishing the office, without first getting a better method. Gentlemen
              might possibly get a little political capital by abolishing that office, but we might
              at the same time by doing this thing hastily place the matter in a worse condition
              than it is now.</p>
            <p>Mr. HELLER. As to this bill No. 290, I never heard of it till it was introduced here
              to-day by the gentleman from Marion. <pb n="300" xml:id="VAA8558-14-300"/> Mr.
              BILLINGSLEY. I desire simply to exonerate the gentleman from Marion from any hand in
              the bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. Both parties are pledged here to repeal the law creating the office of
              Public Printer. The eighth section of the Republican platform pledges the majority
              here to do that; and so far as I am concerned, and many who act with me, we have been
              outspoken in the same direction. And I will say here now, that we have already had
              ample time to have redeemed this pledge. We passed many a bill during the special
              session in less time than that which remains between this and the time when the term
              of the present printer expires. By my bill, which provides to let the printing to the
              lowest bidder, I put the whole matter into the hands of the State officers, so as to
              preclude the abuses that have grown up under the present system. But I am willing that
              these bills should all be printed, and made the special order as soon as may be;
              because there is no matter immediately before us, that is of more importance than
              this. I am in favor of taking the printing out of the hands of one man, and see if we
              can't do something better; for God knows we cannot make it any worse. All I ask is the
              right to act at once. We are now within a few days of the end of the printer's term,
              and there is no need of delay. The question is: Will we carry out our pledges to our
              constituents? It is no time for a man to say here that he is not ready to carry out
              his pledges to the people. Were gentlemen unprepared when they made their pledges? I
              presume they were not, and so they must be prepared now; and for myself, I feel that I
              have the right here to spurn by my action at the earliest moment, the charge that we
              are selling out to the State Printer.</p>
            <p>Mr. WALKER. I think, if no accident befal the <hi rend="sc">BREVIER REPORTS</hi>,
              that the gentlemen from Morgan and Johnson [Mr. Shirley,] will stand very fairly on
              the record as against the continuance of this office. I think he has already made a
              pretty good record against the management of the State printing. And his remarks have
              been very well directed against the office. The items of objections he made came from
              the acts of administration in the office, and not from the office itself. But, sir, if
              you abolish the office you shall be without the officer. All the items of objection
              that attach to the office of State Printer came clearly from its administration ; and
              I cannot think that, therefore the office ought to be abolished. As I understand the
              bill offered by the gentleman for Marion [Mr. Billingsley,] it comes in at the right
              time ; for when you present a bill to abolish the office of printer on account of
              evils in its administration, on the other hand he is bringing a bill to apply the
              remedy, and others have similar propositions. These are what we want. And, for the
              purpose of considering whether the gentleman has the panacea for these evils, let us
              consider and compare them together and see how much we may be helped by them in the
              work of eliminating the evil,by adopting the best plan, or by combining all of them,
              so that no man of straw can take away the spoils. We want to act in this way. But the
              gentleman from Morgan and Johnson seems to think that he can't survive the jeopardy of
              the States interests unless before he sleeps the office of State Printer is abolished.
              But I would say: Let us consider this matter as a whole - for I know of no effort
              here, either partizan or otherwise, to elect this officer till all the questions
              connected with it shall be decided intelligently. But it seems to me that this
              abolishment is the stock in trade of the gentleman from Morgan and Johnson, and that
              he fears that other propositions will cut off his, and the people will never hear of
              it again. But I stand by him when he says that the present system is full of
              fraud;still gross and bad as the present is, there are others that may prove worse. It
              may be, as he insists, that the office should be abolished. If that is so, upon a
              careful finding, we will all vote for it. But I can't understand why it should be
              urged now. Still, I would be in favor of doing it now, if we had both the bills
              matured, so that we could look at the remedy and be convinced that fraud can't enter
              there. I think I might assure the gentleman, that before my party calls upon anybody
              to vote for this officer he will have an opportunity of being heard.</p>
            <p>Mr. BAKER. I am like my friend on the right [Mr. Walker,] I do not feel at present
              any anxiety for the abolishment of this office. That we have to get the State printing
              done by one party or another is patent to all; and we will have to do a good deal of
              printing before the term of the old officer expires; I would like to adopt the new
              system before the old printer goes out. We have now two months to go on, and somebody
              must do our printing. Now it may be that the proposed letting of the printing by
              contract will open the door for more and worse corruption. It will be like the
              biddings for the mail contract with the general government. Therefore I hope our bills
              in this matter will be carefully prepared, and for myself I will say that I prefer the
              continuance of the office of State Printer</p>
            <p>Mr. KIMBALL. The remedy is not in abolishing the office, but in gaurding it against
              fraud. I stand here amongst those who represent the Republican party and respond to
              the Republican platform which recommended the abolishing of this office. We all know
              that at the time of the construction of that platform, the whole State was excited, in
              consequence of grave charges not only against the State Printer but other State
              officers. Now I am in favor of repealing the act creating the printer's office; <pb
                n="301" xml:id="VAA8558-14-301"/> and I think the bill [H. R. 290,] presented by the
              Chairman of the <orgName>Committee on Printing</orgName>, [Mr. Billingsley,] will
              remedy this matter. I feel a delicacy in saying anything in this matter ; because it
              is known that I am connected with a newspaper. But, sir, I had my hand in preparing
              that bill; and it is for the purpose of saving money to the State; and I ask the House
              to consider that bill. It repeals the old law, and it provides that the printer can't
              defraud the State out of one cent unless he has the consent of Governor, the Auditor
              and the Secretary of State. These trusted officers are made commissioners of the
              Public Printing. It provides that the State Printer shall provide all the materials
              for his work - his types, engravings, plates, stereotypings, and everything connected
              with the requirements for the State printing, but he shall print nothing for the State
              except by the requirements of this commission. And furthermore, that he shall be
              allowed only such price for his work as this commission may determine; and the
              determination to be this: that he shall be allowed the name prices that similar work
              can be done for at other establishments. Now, sir, to abolish an office simply because
              one man has done wrong is not right. And, as to the letting of the printing by
              contract - we have just as much right to let out the duties of the Secretary of State,
              or the Auditor, or the Treasurer. And I hope, before the House is called upon to vote
              for or against this office, that gentlemen will thoroughly examine the matter of the
              State printing and see whether the State is to be the gainer or loser by abolishing
              it. The indignation of the people is not hurled against the office. The object which
              the people aim at is not to get rid of the office, but to get rid of the corruptions
              which have grown out of it. And I here make this statement: that so far as the
              contract system has been tried in other States, there has grown out of it as much
              fraud and corruption as we have found here in the State of Indiana ; and I can show
              that it has cost those States more to do their printing by contract than it would have
              cost by an honest administration of the office of State Printer. Under the bill which
              I hope will be passed, the State Printer has no power under the sun to print a line
              for the State, unless he is so authorized by the Governor, Auditor, and Secretary of
              State; and then all his bills must be approved by them. The Auditor is forbidden to
              draw his warrant for the Printer's work, and he can't draw it, without having on it
              also the names of the Governor and Secretary of State. Now all I ask of the House as a
              representative of the people and of the press, and as a democrat, is this, not to
              inflict upon the State a greater wrong in this matter than that which now exists. I
              cannot think that either party in the State, Republican or Democratic, would be guilty
              of conniving at fraud in this or any other matter. Here is a bill framed which I wish
              the General Assembly and the people to read; and if it is not sufficiently guarded I
              hope the House will put the guards in, and strengthen it where it may be weak All I
              ask is for the House to act understandingly, and not inflict a greater than the
              present wrong, as they have done in some of our neighboring States on the subject of
              the public printing. The bill makes the State Printer elective; it compels him to
              provide his paper for the State's work and do it in a good and substantial manner. It
              requires the commissioners to take his account and submit it to the scale of prices of
              printing, and call in other printers to say whether it is overcharged, or if it is
              just; and if it is just they pay it, and if it is overcharged they will cut it down.
              All this is required under the proposed bill. Now I have a letter here from the
              Secretary of the State of Ohio, and another from the Superintendent of printing for
              the State of Illinois, complaining of greater public wrongs by the contract system,
              than by the other. I do not wish to consume the time of the House, but I will read an
              extract from this letter from Ohio. It is dated Nov., 26, 1872, and addressed to J. M.
              Ridenour, President of the Indianapolis Journal Company.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. [interposing.] Is that gentleman engaged in getting up this bill?</p>
            <p>Mr. KIMBALL. I am reading merely for information of the House and the people I
              represent - not to make partizan objections. It is in answer to a letter asking about
              the operation of the contract system. (The letter states the prices which the State of
              Ohio pays - for composition 66 2-3 cents per thousand ems; for press work, 52 cents
              per token; that one of the worst features of their system is the delay about getting
              the work done; then the quality of the work is not good; they are "very much annoyed
              by provoking blunders," and the writer is satisfied that "it could be done more
              economically and better under a more direct system.") I have read this to show, that
              officers of the State of Ohio who have had experience in this matter are of opinion
              that the public printing can be done by an officer of State under just and proper
              guards and restrictions with a saving of money to the State, and with greater
              promptitude and satisfaction on all sides, than it can be done by any man that can be
              found under the contract system. And if we go back into the history of this State some
              30 years, when the duties of the office of Public Printer were honestly discharged, we
              will find that the public printing for 1842 down to 1852 never cost the State more
              than $17,829 in any one year. He read his figures giving the cost of the public
              printing for some of these years, saying that there were times when we had an honest
              administration of this office, and these corruptions grew up in after years, to <pb
                n="302" xml:id="VAA8558-14-302"/> which it is unnecessary to refer here. But in
              order to enact a law that will throw the proper guards around this officer, I have
              prepared this bill and I ask the House to examine it. - He desired simply to do his
              duty as a Representative. He would acquiesce in the repeal of the State Printer act;
              and only asked for a careful consideration of the whole matter.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY proposed only a word in reply to the gentleman from Wayne [Mr. Walker.]
              That gentleman seems to be alarmed at my anxiety for action ; and he thinks I am too
              violently in earnest. I am certainly in earnest while acting here in behalf of an
              honest constituency ; and I think I am complimented, when gentlemen taunt me with
              watchfulness and earnestness. If the gentleman from Wayne is not alarmed at the
              corruptions which have appeared in this office, I confess that I am.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. I do not propose to detain the House long. But I want to say this: That
              there is no law that you can throw round a dishonest man that will make an honest man
              of him; and when I say this, I am not committing myself to the bill No. 31 nor to any
              other bill. But I wish to say this: In all our State conventions, and by all our
              public speakers we have pledged ourselves on both sides to wipe out this office ; and
              this I wish to say further, that we are placed here to-day - after a session of 40
              days - without having taken any action in this matter on the part of the House - and
              by whom? I say it is because of a positive disregard of the order of this House on the
              part of the Committee on Printing. I do not wish to say anything more then the facts
              of the case will warrant. The reason why these bills were not reported back by that
              Committee was to drive us to the point when we might not have time to act on them.
              Sir, the correspondence read by the gentleman from Marion shows - what? It shows that
              this whole matter has been under the supervision of parties who expect the public
              printing at your hands. Has it come to this - that the House of Representatives can't
              perform its duty without outside aid? Another gentleman says we should come to this
              question without embarrassment. But who shall provide for us the Public Printer? The
              caucus, I suppose; and woe be to the man that won't obey its high behests.I say sir,
              that it has been demonstrated that the State Printer's office is the high road to
              corruption - and why? Because in carrying on our political campaigns it requires
              money; and we see that men in certain positions are allowed a liberal salary because
              they contribute liberally to their party; and because the Public Printer is a
              representative of the party in power, and has thrown upon him the burden of the
              expense of his party campaign, the caucus would provide him with the means of doing so
              illegally. I am not talking here as a Republican or a Democrat when I say that this
              order of corruption has been known to prominent Republicans, and they dare not move
              their finger to remove it, because it might injure their party. Therefore I am not
              disposed to allow the Public Printer to be leader for either party. Gentlemen have
              never fathomed the half of this corruption. Then, as to the question before the House,
              I say : Let us try some other scheme. It may be a worse one: But I want to know why
              the law can't guard a matter as well in the hands of a contractor as in the hands of a
              public officer? No sir, gentlemen can'tby all the safeguards they may throw around a
              dishonest public officer - they can't make him honest; and if you get an honest man in
              office - the noblest work of God - he does not need your safeguards. I want to relieve
              this whole question of the public printing from these private influences. I have got
              my friends, and I am in favor of them. But I wan't to wipe out this office now; and if
              we determine again to elect a printer, let us elect the best man ; and if you say we
              do not abolish the office, then we will consider the safegaurds. If you say, abolish
              the office, then we will provide for a different system entirely.</p>
            <p>Mr. BILLINGSLEY. I think the journals of the House will show that the
                <orgName>Committee on Printing</orgName> asked for further time.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. If I am not mistaken, the journals will show that resolutions were
              offered three several times requiring them to report.</p>
            <p>Mr. BILLINGSLEY. When I was present further time was granted, and we desired this,
              and still urged it, because of the necessity of maturing a better system before
              abolishing the office of State Printer. I do not wish to say anything in reply to the
              gentleman from Jefferson; but I think there will be ample opportunity for the
              gentleman to vote for abolishing the office, and to vote for Printer, if necessary.
              But I urge that we should first fully consider the matter.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. As to the repeal of the old public printer law, we wouldn't be in any
              trouble if we were without a public printing law so long as the Legislature is in
              session. We are all agreed that it should be repealed. I believe the Scriptures say
              that the tree which brings not forth good fruit shall be hewn down ; and we are here
              for the purpose of cutting down the corruptions that have shown themselves. Let us
              strike at that law as it is in existence now, because it is evil: and then let us
              discuss the question as to what is proper for the future. And then it will remain for
              the Legislature to determine whether they will have a public printer, or whether they
              will do the work by contract; and I repeat that while the Legislature is in session
              there can no harm grow out of it. We have plenty <pb n="303" xml:id="VAA8558-14-303"/>
              of time; and the trouble about it is that the public is getting to believe that we are
              trying to delay this question, as if it were believed that we are willing to sanction
              the wrong. But I don't believe gentlemen will permit it. And I believe that the only
              way to convince the people of our integrity now is to repeal that law at once; for the
              40 days session is passed and we have not yet reached it. Then let us repeal the
              law;hew it down. We can then build up another, and I could hope at least that it will
              bring forth good fruit. So the pledge made by the Republican party will be redeemed.
              Then if we have to elect a public printer, we may throw such gaurds around him as will
              protect the interests of the State. But I say that law should be stricken down without
              another argument or word.Mr. KIMBALL. The gentleman from Jefferson [Mr. Branham,] is
              in earnest in the advocacy of the position he has taken. He spoke somewhat excitedly
              and with a great deal of vim. He tried to show the House that this whole matter has
              been under the supervision of the Journal Company, intimating that if it had not been
              for the Company the order of the House would have been complied with. I stand here to
              deny that. The Journal Company made no effort to interfere with the Printing Committee
              or with the Legislature in this matter. That letter which I read was procured by one
              of the gentlemen of that paper ; and though I am in that interest it was presented to
              me, not as an advocate of the old law, but of something better that might be
              substituted for it. Whatever I have done in the matter has been done openly. And then
              the intimation that attempts have been made to postpone this thing come with a bad
              grace from one who has never consulted a single man in the House as to this matter. I
              pledge myself sir, that I have not said a word to the Committee in this matter,
              further than that I aided the Chairman [Mr. Billingsley,] in the preparation of the
              bill which he presented. And I had a right to do that. And as to the intimation that
              there is any attempt to spring this matter and force it upon the House by caucus
              nomination, no man has ever heard from me that this thing was to be trusted to the
              Republican party for its action in caucus. So far from that when it was suggested to
              me, I objected, and stated the impropriety of such a course. But I said also, that
              whenever it becomes necessary to caucus for nomination on a political issue, I will go
              in and stand by its action, but not where mere personal interests are concerned. This
              question is in the interest of the State; and whether the man getting the work belongs
              to my Company or not it matters no to me further than as I stand here to represent the
              people. I am opposed to the old law, but I believe you can get nothing better than to
              provide a State Printer, and for that purpose I have suggested the provisions of the
              bill which the Chairman of the <orgName>Printing Committee</orgName> has presented. So
              far as I know, my Company has not to my knowledge made any effort toward influencing
              that Committee. It is true I was asked by a member of my Company to present a document
              to the Committee which I did. If the Republican party have pledged themselves to
              abolish the office of State Printer, let them do as their consciences dictate; but if
              that pledge were taken without the knowledge of what would be right now, I say they
              are not bound by it; but they are bound to do what is right. What I ask in this matter
              is that whatever shall be done, let it be with full knowledge and judgment made up as
              to what is best for the people.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. All I have to say is that the differences of statement between the
              gentleman from Marion [Mr. Kimball,] and myself are before the House, and I am
              perfectly willing to abide their decision.</p>
            <p>Mr. BARRETT. I told my people that no matter what party might succeed, I would vote
              to abolish the office of State Printer. In the State of Ohio they adopted a different
              mode in 1852 ; and to my knowledge there never has been any effort made to have that
              law changed. I was in the State of Ohio in the intermission between the adjournment of
              the last session and opening of this; and there were some who asked me what we were
              going to do with reference to the State printing. I told them I did not know ; but as
              for myself I was willing to try most any other mode than that we have. And then I
              asked in turn: How does your system work? They said: Very well; that they had got the
              printing into the charitable institutions, where they expected to do a great deal of
              it; and it was a great saving to the State. And I thought that a good plan. Now, Mr.
              Speaker, I am ready to vote to abolish the old law to carry out my pledge and my own
              conviction of duty. And I am willing to try almost any other mode for the public
              printing. It seems to me that it cannot be much worse. I want to abolish the old law,
              and give the House time to adopt a better plan. I am willing to adopt most any other
              mode. I don't say I am favor of the lowest bidder, and I won't say I am in favor of
              putting it in the hands of a commission. But let us first get rid of the old law.</p>
            <p>Mr. MELLETT. The insinuation that the Committee may have been influenced from abroad,
              deserves this simple answer: As a member of the Committee on Printing no individual
              has approached me on the subject of the State Printer. In regard to the seeming
              neglect of the Committee about reporting back these bills, I think (other members of
              the Committee will bear me out in saying) that I have never met but once with that
              Committee; and that it is not the fault of the Chairman [Mr. <pb n="304"
                xml:id="VAA8558-14-304"/> Billingsley;] for he has invited me to their sessions
              several times. And they did not report because they considered it was not important
              till it was known what the House would be willing to do. I will say that I am in favor
              of abolishing the old law. I have said so all the time. And the suggestion has been
              made by some gentleman across the way that this thing has been purposely postponed;
              and I presume that charge will rest here on the Committee - of course under the
              pressure of my honorable friend the gentleman from Marion. But if this matter has been
              postponed till on the very eve of the expiration of the term of the office of State
              Printer, in order that another election might be forced by the majority, I must say in
              regard to that matter, that until to-day I have not been enlightened. I did not know
              but his term had already expired ; and I did not know but it might be continued
              further - nor did I care. But I do say that that charge is without foundation. I have
              this further, simply, to say, that the minority need have no fear on account of my
              course; I have no friend for whom I would vote to place him in the office of State
              Printer under the present law. I would as soon send a friend to purgatory. This is a
              question upon which the eyes of the people are fixed, and any negligence or mistake
              about it would be fatal to the best interest of the country.</p>
            <p>Mr. OFFUTT. I have no disposition to prolong this discussion. It seems to me that
              there has been quite enough said. But I have opinions that will control my action. I
              have been a little amused at the course of the opponents of this bill No. 9. They are
              all in favor of abolishing the system by which the printing is now done; yet they urge
              as a reason why they will not vote for the repeal at this time, that they do not know
              what law will be passed to take its place. It seems to me that is begging the
              question. The Legislature is in session; and, if this law is repealed, why can't
              another bill and another system be constructed just as well after this repeal shall
              have taken place as before? And, if we can't find a better system, it will only take a
              day or two to re-enact the old law, I am in favor of the unconditional repeal of that
              law. There is not a man, so far as I know, of either party in the county I have the
              honor to represent, who has ever thought on this subject, or who knows anything about
              the abuses that have grown out of this system, but demands that that law shall be
              repealed and the office of State Printer abolished. It seems to me that we have had
              about enough black cats skinned in Indiana and that we should now destroy the cat
              skinner. Let us wipe out the system that has disgraced the people by the enormous
              frauds it has permitted, inasmuch that men charged with its administration have barely
              escaped the penitentiary. And yet gentlemen can say : We will not repeal it because we
              do not know what we will have in place of it. I have no reflections to cast on the
              gentleman from Marion; but I have a right to state the impression which that
              gentleman's remarks made on my mind. I will say that the argument made by the
              gentleman reminded me more than any thing else of the effort of a hired attorney. He
              has said that he is in favor of the repeal of thia law; but then why does he bring in
              here his documents from the States of Ohio and Illinois, and read them to the House,
              if it is not for the purpose of defeating this repeal, or delaying the vote on this
              question? I say, let us meet it at once; because the people are demanding it; and
              because the system is wrong;it is nothing more nor less than a highway to corruption
              and perjury, as the past has abundantly proven. I have said more than I intended; and
              what I am most particular to say, is this: that I intend to vote for this repeal,
              because it is right and should be done now; and I am not to be intimidated or
              frightened from my position by gentlemen charging that the friends of this repeal are
              endeavoring to cast reflections upon somebody. I do no such thing; but I am entitled
              to my position, and I take it.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. Mr. Speaker, I wish to inquire what is the condition of this bill No
              9.The SPEAKER. All three are on the first reading; none of them have been read the
              second time.Mr. BRANHAM. It seems to me that the motions before the House are not very
              distinct. - The motion I wish to make is that the bill No. 9 be read the second time
              now and made the special order for to-morrow morning.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILSON of Ripley. I am in favor of redeeming every pledge of the Republicanparty;
              but I am not in favor of repealing this law till we have something to take its place.
              I have the honor of being a member of the Committee on Printing, and I have not met
              with them yet. I am not a practical printer, and I have failed to meet with that
              Committee because I felt that I could do no good there. What do gentlemen purpose? Do
              they propose to leave us without any law on this subject? This is a very difficult
              matter to handle. What are we to do without this officer? What are we to do without
              printing; so long as we have nothing in our legislation to take the place of that
              which we propose to repeal? There will be ample time to repeal, and it will be better
              and safer, when we shall have matured the remedy. I do not believe that there is a man
              on this floor, who does not desire some change in our legislation on this subject. I
              think it would be the utmost folly to repeal any law before we have something to take
              its place. It is sometimes better to bear the ills we have than <pb n="305"
                xml:id="VAA8558-14-305"/> fly to those we know not of. If we repeal this law now,
              any measure which we propose may be so met and so treated that we will be left without
              any action upon the subject.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOODARD. I introduced a resolution in regard to this measure during the special -
              session. I am willing that parties who have made pledges - and I know of no gentleman
              of either party who have not made pledges of - some kind - should have opportunity to
              make them good. I believe we all want to arrive at correct conclusions. Now as we have
              passed through the extra session, l am willing to give a reasonable time to the
              consideration of this question. The motion of the gentleman to make it a special order
              suits me.</p>
            <p>Mr. MILLER. Unfortunately for myself I am not a member of the Committee on Printing.
              I have very little interest in this question; and I am not excited; nor do I think the
              Treasury of Indiana stands at present in any great danger. I have not heard of one
              dollar being taken out of the Treasury improperly since the public attention was
              directed to the abuses in the printer's office; and I verily believe that the public
              Treasury would be as well protected under the present law as it would be by any action
              we could pass now. I hardly think that pledges of conventions made for votes ought to
              be regarded here. It seems to me that we might disregard such pledges if it were
              necessary to give us a better law. I can see no reason why we should repeal this law
              unless it were to make men virtuous. But where is the necessity of repealing this bill
              before Thursday ? There is a motion for making these bills number 9 and number 31, and
              the bill of the gentleman from Marion the special order for Thursday. That will give
              time for reflection; and we can determine then what we will do. If we reject the plan
              of the gentleman from Marion, we will turn to the bill of the gentleman from Morgan
              and Johnson. I think there would be a sufficient length of time to consider all these
              bills before the expiration of the office of public printer.</p>
            <p>Mr. COBB. I desire in the first place to thank the gentleman. (Mr. Kimball,) for the
              information he has given us in regard to the contract system as it operates in the
              neighboring States. Now, as we are all pledged to repeal this office; and as I belong
              to a party that always keep their pledges, I think we shall be able to repeal the
              present system of doing the public printing. But I desire to have all the light we can
              get upon this subject; and as I have a little more confidence in my own judgment than
              I have in that of any other person I have ever been acquainted with, I will move that
              all three of these bills be printed and made the special order for Friday morning
              immediately after the reading of the journal.</p>
            <p>Mr. WALKER recognized himself as a member of the Committee on Printing but never
              having met with it was not aware of its action till it was reported to the House.</p>
            <p>The SPEAKER. There are three bills. The first motion is to make them all the special
              order for Thursday. But the first question will be on the motion [Mr. Givan's,] to
              print the bill No. 31, to provide for the printing by contract with the lowest
              responsible bidder.</p>
            <p>The motion was adopted.</p>
            <p>The next question was on Mr. Billingsley's motion to print his bill [H. R, 290;] and
              it was also adopted.</p>
            <p>The SPEAKER. The question now recurs on refering these bills to the committee of the
              whole House, and making them the special order for Thursday.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. I move to amend the motion so as to make the special order for Thursday
              two o'clock - without the reference to the committee of the whole.</p>
            <p>Mr. BAKER preferred Monday; but Mr. Branham's amendment was accepted and adopted.</p>
            <p>The SPEAKER. The question still recurs on some disposition of the bill No. 9.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. I move that it be considered now.</p>
            <p>The SPEAKER. It is is now a substitute bill, and has not yet been read the second
              time.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLEN. Then I move to suspend the Constitutional restriction that it may be read
              the second time, and referred with the other bills.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. It can be referred or postponed as well at its present stage. I move to
              postpone and make it the special order with the other bills.</p>
            <p>The motion was adopted.</p>

              <p>Mr. BUTTS said the Committee on Temperance have used great care in the examination
                and preparation of a temperance bill which will now soon be introduced. It was
                considered best by the Committee that their bill should not be introduced till the
                second week in the session, when the petitions should have come in and the subject
                should have been fully considered. It is desirable that the bill which will now be
                introduced by the gentleman from Tippecanoe (Mr. Hollingsworth) should take the
                place of Mr. Hollingsworth's bill No. 196, "to prevent the injurious results arising

              <p>The SPEAKER laid before the House the Senate's Message announcing the refusal of
                that body to concur in the concurrent resolution of the House to exclude
                Newspapers.</p>
              <p>Mr. WILSON of Ripley. Mr. Speaker, I move that the House adhere to the adoption of
                the resolution.</p>
              <p>Mr. COBB. If we would do anything it must be through a <orgName>Committee of
                  Conference</orgName>; but it seems to me that the resolution has now failed.</p>
              <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. I do not desire to make any appropriation for newspapers; but if the
                other branch will, I don't see how we can help it. I do not think it is right, but
                if the Senate choose to make an appropriation for themselves, the House refusing to
                concur leaves the responsibility with them. I do not know but we have gone too far
                in this matter; if they will vote themselves the paper, let them be responsible for
                their action. I do not want any except what I pay for myself.</p>
              <p>Mr. OFFUTT. I was not in my place, the other day when this resolution was passed
                refusing to pay for papers that might be ordered for the General Assembly, but if I
                had been I should have voted for it. I hesitated at the time it was introduced
                whether we would be doing the wisest thing to pass the per diem bill; and I decided
                both ways before I could determine to vote for it. But upon the explanations of
                gentlemen, going to show that it would cut off all indirect expenditures of the
                public money for the General Assembly and stop all perquisites hereafter hearing the
                careful estimates submitted by the gentleman for Morgan [Mr. Satterwhite] that in
                the end it would be no additional expense to the State - I finally consented to vote
                for the bill.</p>
              <pb n="307" xml:id="VAA8558-14-307"/>
              <p>But now it has been charged in my county that that bill does not cut off
                newspapers, But I say here that under no view would I have voted for it, had I not
                been fully assured that it would cut them off. So far as I am individually
                concerned, that is the view I entertain on this subject; and I never will vote for
                an appropriation bill containing an item for newspapers and stamps for the General
                Assembly. I stand on the import of the per diem bill; and the House having passed it
                with that idea, we ought in good faith to carry it out.</p>
              <p>Mr. RAMSEY. I recollect that about six days ago the House committed itself by a
                explanatory resolution in reference to that bill - that that was the construction
                which this House put upon it. We can't act consistently if we go back on that
                resolution. Hence I can't respect the action of the Senate in refusing to concur in
                this resolution which has been adopted on the part of the House.</p>
              <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. It seems to me that the refusal of the Senate to concur in this
                resolution is conclusive of this matter so far as the subject is connected with this
                House and that when we undertake to controle that matter in the Senate we trespass
                on prerogative. Now it seems to me that the per diem bill can't be made to exclude
                newspapers by any fair construction. It matters not what gentlemen may have thought
                about it; the only question of construction is this: does the bill as a matter of
                law necessarily cut off newspapers from the House and Senate? It seems to me that
                that question must be answered in the negative. That was my construction of the bill
                when I voted for it. I understood that it cuts off just what it expressed in the
                words of the act; stationerythat is paper, pens, ink, pencils and postage stamps;
                but not newspapers: because they were provided here independently.</p>
              <p>Mr. OFFUTT [interposing.] I desire to ask the gentleman from Gibson if he did not
                hear the calculations made on the floor by the friends of the bill, and whether in
                those calculations newspapers were not included?</p>
              <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. I did: but I am not responsible for the calculations and views of
                others. I understand that the act cannot be construed to mean what its language does
                not legally justify. And that is the view of the Senate; and they are entitled to
                it; that the per diem bill does not include newspapers by any just construction, and
                if we concede this, by proceeding to insist on this resolution we are trespassing
                unwarrantably on the privileges of the Senate. And as to what our constituents may
                say on this subject, we have nothing to do with that. I do not think it would be
                very wise or very well for us now to be too nice about this matter. Whilst avoiding
                Scylla on one side we may strike Charybdis on the other. By attempting too much
                economy even we might bare ourselves to the suspicion that we are playing the part
                of demagogues in this matter. Now, sir, I did vote, and I would again vote against
                newspapers in the House; but I would do so independently of anything in the <hi
                  rend="i">per diem</hi> bill; for I do not consent that, by the per diem bill we
                are bound to vote for the exclusion of newspapers.</p>
              <p>Mr. HENDERSON. When the per diem bill was introduced, like the gentleman from
                Hancock [Mr. Offutt] I also took different sides; but when it was properly explained
                I voted for it. Now what are rules for interpreting law? In the first place we are
                told that it is necessary to interrogate the law makers. I was one of the makers of
                this law; and now is the time for us to be interrogated on this question of
                interpretation. And I understand that when that bill was passed it was the intention
                by it to cut off everything in the way of perquisites - newspapers, stamps -
                everything of that kind.</p>
              <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. I understand the rule of interpretation in accordance with the
                intention of the Legislature to be qualified in this: that you are not to carry the
                construction beyond the plain meaning of the language used by the Legislature in the
                enactment of the law.</p>
              <p>Mr. HENDERSON. I understand that the first rule of interpretation is the
                understanding of the law makers; and it was my understanding that the per diem bill
                should exclude newspapers ; and therefore the contrary must be a strained
                interpretation to fit the case. My intention was that it should cut off everything,
                and I am satisfied such was the intention of the majority - that we would be rid of
                the newspapers - stop the question of perquisites - that eight dollars a day should
                be sufficent. And now I think this resolution is sufficient to determine what we
                meant by the eight dollars a day.</p>
              <p>Mr. WALKER. I have no disposition to intrude upon the prerogatives of the Senate;
                but by the resolution of the gentleman from Knox [Mr. Cauthorn] we have said that
                the eight dollars a day shall include everything; and I think it is proper now that
                we should admonish the Senate that we have declared our intention in passing that
                law, and that the Senate should not remain ignorant of it. But if we do not adhere
                to this resolution - if we recede from it - we have still the specific bill to fall
                back on; because the Senate is notified of our interpretation of that law ; and if
                they continue to vote themselves newspapers it is their responsibility. But if we
                now retract our interpretation it will not be fair toward those whose support of the
                  <hi rend="i">per diem</hi> bill was obtained from that consideration. I think that
                we should again inform the Senate that it was eight dollars a day and no more;
                because if the Senate now vote themselves newspapers, and statutes without returning
                them, the nex <pb n="308" xml:id="VAA8558-14-308"/> General Assembly will do the
                same, and this provision of the law against perquisites will be a dead letter,
                whilst it must be conceded as just and right; and it is the suggestion of the
                incoming Governor to pay so much and no more for the public service - that
                prequisites are wrong in principle.I believe, sir, that it would not be trespassing
                on the powers of the co-ordinate branch, to notify them that we cannot recede.</p>
              <p>Mr. WILSON of REipley. It seems to me that the only objection to this resolution
                is, that it is immodest in us. But I ask you, sir, if it is not a part of the duty
                of this House to determine whether members of the General Assembly shall increase
                their pay or not? I have always been perplexed with this question of increasing our
                salary by stationery. Now, if we procure newspapers for the people with the peoples
                money, the beneficence of our action should be equal. But do we furnish all our
                constituents with newspapers? No, we furnish only some of our particular friends.
                Then the procuring of these newspapers is just simply increasing our own pay. But
                these papers come in here wrapped and stamped ; and, however we may regard it, we
                take all the credit to ourselves, and we say to our constituents who receive the
                papers: We did it - and forget that they pay for them. It is all wrong in principle,
                and I am in favor of stopping all these little leaks that are nearly doubling the
                taxes of the people. For we are paying to-day nearly $300,000 for what is called
                "stationery" in the Courts and county offices of the State paying this for
                stationery for men that are no more entitled to it than any private citizens. Sir,
                we can't defend this action if we turn our backs on the record we made at the last
                session.</p>
              <p>Mr. HELLER. Whilst I voted against taking the newspapers here, I desire to ask the
                Chair whether this per diem bill is going to cut off the Geological, the
                Agricultural, and the Brevier Reports?</p>
              <p>The SPEAKER. Not at all, sir.</p>
              <p>Mr. HELLER. Well now, I ask if newspapers are cut off, and those reports are not
                but are to be all sent to the people - for it seems to me to cut off the Legislature
                from receiving them for themselves; so that when a man becomes a member of the
                Legislature he is no longer on an equality with the private citizens.</p>
              <p>Mr. OFFUTT. I understand that these reports are for the people. I do not understand
                that the Legislature have anything to do with them but as citizens of the State.
                Neither do I understand that, because a man is in the Legislature he is deprived of
                his rights as a citizen, but he may accept an Agricultural report as a private
                citizen.</p>
              <p>Mr. HELLER. I ask you, if under the law you can here accept a copy of the Acts or
                of the Journals?</p>
              <p>The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Allen will make his interrogatories in a
                parliamentary manner.</p>
              <p>Mr. HELLER. I interrogate the gentleman only I give him the right to interrogate
                me. I am here on an equal footing with others on this floor: and when our act does
                not include these books and papers I claim that we should abide the strict
                construction of the law; and if we intended to restrict newspapers as to the House,
                we intended to restrict them as to the Senate. But while I vote against newspapers I
                still think it is a wrong construction of the law.</p>
              <p>Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. If we concur with the Senate by receding from this resolution we
                place ourselves in the position of inconsistency. I voted against the per diem bill;
                but I know that the papers were excluded by it, and it was so understood and so
                expressed on the floor in order to show that the bill would not add to the general
                expensiveness of legislation. After that act, and after the adoption of the
                resolution by which we have construed that act, we cannot consistently recede from
                this resolution.</p>
              <p>Mr. COBB. While I am in favor of adhering to this resolution and while I have
                commenced the practice of purchasing my own papers and stamps, and while I voted for
                the resolution construing the <hi rend="i">per diem</hi> bill, I did not do it
                because I thought it a fair and just construction of the language of the <hi
                  rend="i">per diem</hi> bill; for I insist that it cannot be so construed as to cut
                off the newspapers here. We do not ourselves so understand the meaning of the term
                "stationery," as to use it for newspapers, and stamped newspapers at that; because
                we have all of us received newspapers here, and I am satisfied that not a single man
                of us had his newspapers and stamps charged up to his account of "stationery." If
                that had been our understanding of this term at that time, if we had acted in good
                faith, we would have gone to the Secretary and said to him each one of us, that we
                have received from the newspaper publishers a certain number of papers, and a
                certain number of newspapers wrapped and stamped, which are worth so much, and we
                want these charged to our stationery account. I say then that I voted for these
                resolutions because they are right; not because they are in the <hi rend="i">per
                  diem</hi> bill. I believe that it's good policy to do this ; and while I am in
                favor of this resolution as good policy for the government of this House,I think
                that while we have done well in going thus far, we cannot go to the extent of
                requiring the Senate to adopt a forced construction of the law. Sir, you may take
                the deposition of any member of this House or of any gentleman outside, and require
                him solemnly to give his opinion, his construction of the law, and it would have no
                particular weight In the case, because the con- <pb n="309" xml:id="VAA8558-14-309"
                /> struction must be according to the import of the language of the law. I am not in
                favor of making a construction here against that of a co-ordinate branch of the
                General Assembly. - I think, if we would keep up a proper comity and good faith with
                the other end of the capitol, we are bound to accept their construction. While I am
                in favor of this resolution, which it is competent for us to take as governing
                ourselves; and, while I believe it is right, I am not so extra-conscientious as to
                say I will not allow anybody else to do what I conceive to be wrong. - Now I hope
                the House will let this resolution drop; for it is about as near dead as anything
                can be.</p>
              <p>Mr. THAYER. The <hi rend="i">per diem</hi> bill is law. But now if under its
                provisions we voted a certain amount of "stationery," for the use of the officers of
                the House, do we not say that in this way we might receive these papers under the
                law allowing ourselves to vote ourselves stationery? - especially when there is no
                other law forbiding it? Or, is it not true, that when we pass a law cutting off
                '"stationery," that it cuts off all perquisites in its train?</p>
              <p>Mr.COBB. I think not.</p>
              <p>The SPEAKER. That is enough.</p>
              <p>Mr. COBB. I do not wish to make a quarrel with the Senate. This resolution as I
                understand it - the Senate not concurring - it is dead - it has fallen to pieces. It
                is not a matter for us to consider again. While still - adhering to our construction
                of yesterday - by coming in here to-day and saying we are in favor of that
                construction again can't help us any. This as a concurrent resolution is simply
                dead, because the other branch refuses to concur in it. Let us not be seeking a
                quarrel with the Senate in advance upon what may become after this a vexatious
                question; and when that may come up as a just issue it will be time enough to argue
                this question ; and let us not, in this way, attempt to strengthen our courage for
                the evil day when it comes.</p>
              <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. By unanimous consent of the House I desire to offer a bill
                supplemental to the <hi rend="i">per diem</hi> bill. ("Consent""consent.") Mr. W.
                then introduced a bill [H. R. 315] for an act supplemental to the act fixing the per
                diem of members of the General Assembly, approved December 19, 1872, and providing
                that no additional perquisites shall be allowed.</p>
              <p>[The object (as he explained it) being to provide by law that no appropriation of
                the money of the State Treasury shall be allowed for newspapers or stamps furnished
                to members of the General Assemble.] It was passed to the second reading, and
                referred to a <orgName>Special Committee</orgName> appointed by the Speaker, namely:
                Messrs. Woollen, Wilson of Ripley, and Wood.</p>
              <p>So the question was passed over informally for the present.</p>

              <p>On motion of Mr. Taylor all petitions on file on that subject were referred to the

                suppli-mental assessments by plank and gravel road companies, which were referred to
                the appropriate Committee.</p>

              <p>Mr. SCOTT explaining his negative vote - he was opposed to members being supplied
                with stationery for their private correspondence, but thought there was no law to

              <p>Mr. SLATER also explained that he had been requested by State officers to introduce

              <p>Mr. FULLER introduced a bill [S. 208] for an act to amend section 9 of the act
                defining felonies, approved June 17, 1872. It provides that when a mortal wound is
                given or poison administered in one county and the victim dies in another, the

              <p>Mr. BEESON introduced a bill [S. 209] for an act authorizing plank, gravel and
                Macadamized road companies, with the concurrence of Township Trustees when they
                shall have completed their roads and made it free of toll, to levy a tax ot not less

                township railroad act approved May 12, 1869, and to authorize Boards of
                Commissioners to extend the time for paying the same and erase the same from the tax
                duplicate. It provides for the extension for a period not less than six months nor
                more than twelve, on the petition of fifty tax-payers, of the time for the payment
                of taxes levied in aid of railroads, in case no work has been done on the road in
                the county or township.</p>
              <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Scott, introduced a bill [S. 211] for an act providing for the
                payment to Township Trustees of all monies collected by County Treasurers from tax

              <head rend="center">PAY OF MEMBERS AND OFFICERS.</head>
              <p>Mr. TAYLOR from a majority of the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName> returned
                the bill [H. R. 294] appropaiating $125,000 for expenses of the Legislature, with an
                amendment allowing the elective officers eight dollars a day.</p>
              <p>Mr. DAUGHERTY for the minority, of said Committee, submitted a report recommending
                that the amendment proposed by the majority be laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence was satisfied the amount of labor performed by the
                elective officers entitles them to the same pay with members. Their responsibilities
                were greater than that of members and they ought to be well paid for their services.
                He hoped the minority report would not be adopted. He had been familiar with the
                amount of labor performed by the Secretary and Assistant Secretary, and to some
                extent with the labor and responsibility imposed on the Doorkeeper, and had become
                satisfied that the amount of labor that they perform entitles them to the same pay
                as is received by members.</p>
              <p>Mr. ORR did all he could last session against raising the <hi rend="i">per
                  diem</hi> of members, but now he thought it would be doing injustice not to extend
                the same pay to the elective officers that members get.</p>
              <p>Mr. HARNEY favored the adoption of the minority report. The rule that should govern
                those employed here should be the same that maintains in any other branch of
                business. He thought the present pay was sufficient.</p>
              <p>Mr. DWIGGINS was willing to pay every man his due; but it occurred to him that
                thirty five dollars a week was sufficient pay for these officers. The best clerical
                labor in the country can be obtained for that sum, and he hoped the minority report
                would be adopted.</p>
              <p>Mr. DAUGHERTY understood that there is already a statute fixing the pay of employes
                of the General Assembly; and that by implication the Constitutional provision
                against the increase of members pay would also apply against this amendment. And he,
                too, thought the present pay sufficient.</p>

              <head rend="center">EXEMPTION INCREASE.</head>
              <p>On motion of Mr. Brown his bill [S. 47] for an act to exempt certain personal
                property from sale on execution, was read the third time. [In addition to the
                exemptions already allowed, all family pictures, school books and family bible; one
                yoke of oxen or one span of horses and harness; farming and agricultural implements
                not exceeding in value the sum of three hundred dollars; the tools of any mechanic
                or laborer not exceeding three hundred dollars; the library and instruments of
                professional men not exceeding in value five hundred dollars - these values to be
                ascertained by the exemption law of February 17, 1852, and all supplemental acts
                thereto.]</p>
              <p>Mr. SLATER opposed the bill because it makes a distinction between the laboring man
                and professional men.</p>
              <p>Mr. S. said the bill discriminated against farmers, giving them but $300 exemption,
                and to professional men $500. He could not sustain that.</p>
              <p>Mr. BOONE suggested that fishing tackle be included in the list of exemptions,
                which Mr. Brown said he would accept.</p>
              <p>Mr. HOUGH also opposed any distinction in favor of professional men, and unless
                amended in that particular he should vote against the bill. He would be in favor of
                increasing the amount to five hundred dollars all the way through the bill.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. BROWN and by common consent the bill was amended so as to make the
                value of property exempt in all cases $500.</p>
              <p>Mr. DWIGGINS opposed the bill inasmuch as laborers seldom have five hundred dollars
                worth of tools, while professional men usually have more than that much. If there
                should be an exemption of this kind, why not say that the exemption should be for
                eight hundred dollars instead of three hundred, and let it remain with the party who
                takes the benefit of it to select the property he desires. He saw no impropriety in
                naming the articles to be exempted. He was opposed to as great an exemption as eight
                hundred dollars. It is the experience of every man who has been a practicing lawyer
                that the men who take advantage of the three hundred dollar exemption law are men
                not inclined to pay their debts, but men who do it for the purpose of swindling
                their creditors. The object of exemption laws is not to benefit the creditor but to
                prevent pauperism. In theory, every dollars worth of property a debtor has belongs
                to his creditors. Exemption laws are enacted for the purpose of preventing public
                pauperism. Is it public policy now to make an exemption of eight hundred dollars
                instead of three? I do not think it is. I am opposed to making it eight hundred
                dollars. I think it the worst policy the State can adopt. It would drive men away
                from the State who would otherwise come to spend their money here, because they
                would say: "If we go into business and sell on credit we can't collect," therefore
                they are forced to adopt one of the two systems: either not do any business or do a
                cash business.</p>
              <p>Mr. HOUGH referred to the effect of exemption laws in the States of Michigan and
                Illinois. The law in Michigan exempts forty acres of land and all a man can put on
                it, and still, that State, younger than ours with a similar population is quite as
                prosperous. So with the State of Illinois; and are men going to say that they are
                kept from engaging in business because the people can give such large exemption? He
                was not apprehensive any such result would ensue. He did not suppose the provision
                of this bill would benefit professional men especially, but if enacted into a law it
                will be for the benefit of a class who need its protection.</p>
              <p>Mr. BROWN. It is well known that in a great many States certain specific articles
                of property belonging to a debtor are exempted from sale on execution, and it was
                thought best by some to have something of that sort in this bill. Upon reflection I
                think it will perhaps meet the view of the Senate better if we increase the amount;
                and for the purpose of taking the sense of the Senate whether it prefers simply to
                increase the amount of exemption I will move to refer the bill to a special
                committee of three with instructions to strike out so much as refers to specific
                articles to be exempted and bring in a bill to increase the amount of property now
                allowed to be exempted to eight hundred dollars.</p>
              <p>Mr. SCOTT opposed this motion. This bill has been drawn for the purpose of
                exempting not a certain amount of money from sale and seizure, but such tools as are
                necessary as a means of livelihood - to allow men to retain for their own use and
                for the protection of their families such articles or things as they are in the
                habit of making their livelihood with. You take away from a mechanic his tools and
                he is in a manner without obtaining his living. Take from a lawyer or a phypician
                his library and he is in the same fix. Taking this view of the case five hundred
                dollars to a lawyer is no more in amount than one hundred dollars to a carpenter or
                a blacksmith. When gentlemen say that we are discriminating in favor of
                professionial men, gentlemen don't understand, the purpose of the bill. I am in
                favor of an exemption of eight hundred dollars, or a thousand dollars, or a
                homestead. I am in favor of every family having a place where it can flee to, and
                cannot be disturbed by any bodv, and I think the prosperity of the State could be
                vastly increased if every head of a family had a half acre of ground to <pb n="313"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-14-313"/> put all the improvement upon he might, and so guarded
                that nobody could touch it. I would not be afraid of injury to the State by such a
                law. It is not the history of a State adjoining us. Look at the prosperity of an
                adjoining State in population-an increase almost double that of Indiana - because
                she gives her citizens an abiding home. This bill is a step in the right direction
                because it proposes to leave in the hands of men the means of making an honest
                livelihood. I hope the bill will pass in its present shape, keeping in view the idea
                of leaving in the hands of every man the tools he has been useing heretofore, so
                that he may not be driven to a new business.</p>
              <p>Mr. BOONE read the 22nd section, Article 1, of the Constitution, as follows: "The
                privilege of the debtor to enjoy the necessary comforts of life, shall be recognized
                by wholesome laws, exempting a reasonable <hi rend="i">amount</hi> of property from
                seizure or sale for the payment of any debt or liability hereafter contracted ; and
                there shall be no imprisonment for debt, except in case of fraud."</p>
              <p>He thought the meaning of this provision was, that the exemption to be provided for
                by law should be in <hi rend="i">amount</hi> and not in specific articles. Thus
                allowing the debtor to select what he thought would most conduce to his comfort or
                prosper his business. He could readily see that where specific articles were
                exempted, some would not have them or only a part of them; whilst others might have
                all of them and yet if driven to select what would add most to their comfort or
                business would choose other property than the articles exempted.</p>
              <p>In practice it would operate unfairly and unequally. He thought therefore that the
                bill was in conflict with the spirit and letter of the Constitution, and would
                oppose it in its present shape. He would favor an increase of the amount of
                exemption.</p>
              <p>The exemption of $300, was fixed in 1852, and was quite as much then to a debtor as
                $800, or a $1000, would be now. He desired that the reference should be made.</p>
              <p>No one could desire that debtors who were unfortunate should be reduced to
                pauperism. It could result in no good to creditors in a majority of cases nor to the
                public; but the contrary.</p>
              <p>Mr HUBBARD. It seems to me this bill is a step in the right direction. I have
                alwaysbelieved that the true policy of every Statewas to pass liberal exemption and
                sharp collection laws. We have to-day appraisement laws that strike just those cases
                which they should not. After that we have redemption laws that still further put off
                the collection of debts. Our laws, in this respect, are perhaps more liberal than
                those of any of the surrounding States. On the other hand, we have an exemption law
                that is more beggarly than that in any of the neighboring States, and perhaps in any
                other State. Illinois allows an exemption not exceeding in value one thousand
                dollars, and Michigan 40 acres of land with the improvements on it; while Indiana
                only allows an exemption of three hundred dollars. Whichever way this bill is shaped
                I propose to vote for it, believing it to be one of the best measures proposed this
                session. I fail to see the force of the argument of the Senator from Vigo [Mr.
                Scott.] A man is supposed to know what is best for himself, and under this bill,
                should it become a law; laborers can select such tools as they please; and the
                exemption is for their benefit. If the exemption is raised to eight hundred dollars
                every person is presumed to use it for the purpose of saving articles most necessary
                in order to get an honest livelihood. On the other hand I see where it may operate
                against the laborer; he may own other property subject to execution under the act
                and his tools may not amount to over one hundred dollars, while a lawyer's library
                is no library at all unless it amounts to more than five hundred dollars. Now it
                seems to me the object will be better saved by raising the exemption to eight
                hundred dollars than by leaving it open to specific articles, because it will be
                safe to say that every man will save what is most necessary for his family. Such a
                measure would subserve the purpose better of preserving the State from
                pauperism.</p>
              <p>Mr. ORR said he was in favor of the bill and hoped it would pass; - that the
                enactment of such a law would be a great encouragement to the poor man; it would
                stimulate him to use all honorable efforts to become owner of the amount of property
                exempt from execution as set forth in the bill. I cannot think as some Senators in
                this chamber have expressed themselves, that the passage of the bill would be a
                great injury to the poor man; that is he could get no credit under it. My judgement
                is that it would give him more credit. But that is not all, the great merit in this
                measure is, that the bill if enacted would secure to the poor wife and helpless
                little children $500, from the grasp of the money sharks of our country.</p>
              <p>Mr. STEELE. I think it better to make this law apply to everybody than to make it
                apply to certain articles of property. I think the amount, instead of being five
                hundred dollars or eight hundred dollars, should be at least one thousand dollars to
                place it at what would be a reasonable sum. Of course it will not effect contracts
                that have heretofore been made. I think it will have a beneficial effect on society
                if we declare that one thousand dollars worth of property shall be exempt from
                execution. Sometimes a lawyer would like to have his library exempt; on the other
                hand he may have a good home for his wife and children that is still more dear to
                him than his library. Allow <pb n="314" xml:id="VAA8558-14-314"/> him to retain what
                he chooses. If the law exempts his library and books alone, he would have no choice.
                I hope if this bill is referred to a committee that the committee will be
                unrestricted as to the amount.</p>
              <p>Mr. Brown modified his motion so that the instructions to the committee shall be
                for a $1000 exemption.</p>
              <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
              <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR made the committee to consist of Messrs. Brown, Hough and
                Glessner.</p>

              messages from the House requiring action on the part of the Senate.</p>
            <p>The bill [H. R. 3] to repeal the act for the construction of levees, dykes and

              <head rend="center">EXEMPTION INCREASE.</head>
              <p>Mr. BROWN from the select committee thezeon, returned his exemption bill [S. 147]
                with a substitute bill, whose principal section provides that an amount of property
                not exceeding $1,000 in value, owned by any resident householder, married man, or
                head of a family, dependent upon him or her for support, shall not be liable to sale
                on execution or any other final process for any debt founded on contract, expressed
                or implied.</p>
              <p>Mr B. moved that the report be concurred in, and that the bill be put on its
                passage.</p>
              <p>Mr. NEFF. If this bill applies to contracts passed as well as in the future it is
                wrong.</p>
              <p>Mr STEELE. I understand that question has been decided by the Supreme Court that it
                will not.</p>
              <p>Mr. CHAPMAN moved to concur in the report of the Committee with an amendment that
                when the head of the family does not claim the exemption, the right may be claimed
                by his wife or any one of his family dependent on him for support.</p>
              <p>Mr. BROWN accepted the amendment.</p>
              <p>Mr. DAGGY opposed the amendment because we have a law passed in 1857, and one March
                11, 1867, that fully covers the point. He said the laws already secured to the wife
                the same rights more explicitly than would be done by the amendment. He read the
                section to which he referred, which provided that in the absence of the husband the
                wife might claim the exemption and file the schedule. In regard to the other
                proposition that this law may be retroactive he found by the reference to the ninth
                Indiana Reports, page 38, that it will be prospective and not retroactive and can
                apply only to expressed and implied contracts in the future.</p>
              <p>Mr. CHAPMAN. The wife has no rights when the husband is present. My amendment is
                that she may claim the same rights as if she were absent from him; and if he has no
                wife any one of his household may have the right to claim the exemption. The law the
                Senator read refers to the man as the head of the family; and the other part of the
                section he refered to is predicated on the same principle. Therefore I think the
                objection of the Senator is not well taken. There is no law provided to cover the
                object of the amendment I have offered and which has been accepted by the author of
                the bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. C. insisted that the sections read by the Senator from Putnam [Mr. Daggy,] did
                not give the wife the rights conferred by his amendment. The present law only
                confers these rights on the wife when the husband was absent. His amendment provided
                that in case of his failure, present or absent, to claim the exemption, she, or any
                member of the family may do so.</p>
              <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. For many years we have had a law exempting $300, from sale on
                execution, and I have heard no complaint against it. It is a wide range from $300 to
                $1,000 and then you are offering to the man twice the amount of property the widow
                gets when her husband dies. Now you propose to give to the man $1,000 but when he
                dies you will let the creditors take $500 of that away from his widow!</p>
              <p>Mr. BROWN thought this bill would be an act of justice to both debtor and creditor.
                He believed, with the Senator from St. Joseph, [Mr. Hubbard] that the best thing for
                the debtor would be to give him a liberal exemption law and enact sharp collection
                laws. The collection laws of the State of Indiana are more loose than in many other
                States, and that is one of the reasons why the rate of interest is <pb n="315"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-14-315"/> so high and why men are prevented from investing their
                money in commercial enterprises here.</p>
              <p>Mr. STEELE objected that to confer the right to claim the benefit of the exemption
                law upon any member of the family was going too far. Any one of a dozen children
                might claim the benefit in opposition to the wishes of both father and mother.</p>
              <p>Mr. HARNEY had grave objections to both the bill and the amendment. The
                Constitution contemplated only that the debtor should be secured in the enjoyment of
                the necessarycomforts of life, and he thought $1,000 morethan was necessary to
                comply with the benefits contemplated by the Constitution. A man owning $800 worth
                of property should be just as liable to pay his debts as a man owning $1,000 worth.
                Michigan and Illinois has been referred to as examples of the beneficent effects of
                a liberal exemption law. The benefits were not so real as they appeared. In one of
                those States where forty acres of land are exempt, the lands of nearly all the small
                landholders are mortgaged because no credit will be given them, on account of this
                exemption, without the security of a mortgage. If they have no real estate there are
                chattel mortgages, and it is unsafe to buy either real estate or chattel property in
                some of those States without first examining the records to see that it is
                unencumbered. So such laws are not so much for the benefit of the poor man as some
                gentlemen seem to think. The poor man, who is honest, will generally give up all
                that is not absolutely necessary for the immediate comfort of his family, to satisfy
                his debts, while the man that is disposed to do wrong is the man who receives the
                larger amount of this benefit. There is many a man now doing business whose property
                will not inventory $1,000 and yet whose in credit is good. Pass this bill and exempt
                his entire property from liability for his debts and his credit will be gone and his
                business broke up. He believed the result of such a measure would be most disastrous
                to the poor man, and would bring about a state of affairs not desirable by the
                people. It has not been petitioned for by the poor; in fact there has been complaint
                that the present exemption law operates so as to deny them the credit they should
                have because mean men are continually taking advantage of it.</p>
              <p>Mr. GLESSNER moved to amend by striking $1,000 and inserting $800.</p>
              <p>Mr. STEELE moved to lay the motion on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. BROWN raised the point of order that, the bill being on the third reading, Mr.
                Glessner's motion was out of order.</p>
              <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided the point of order not well taken. The amendment
                was laid on the table by the following vote:</p>

              <p>Mr. WILLIAMS raised the point of order that laying the amendment on the table
                carried the whole subject with it.</p>
              <p>The LIEUTENANT GONERNOR decided the point not well taken.</p>
              <p>Mr. WILLIAMS said his objection to the bill was that it gave the husband $1,000
                exemption while the widow has a dower of but $500. He moved to recommit the bill to
                the Committee on Rights and Privileges, with instructions to strike out $1,000 and
                insert $500 so as to place the husband and widow on an equality.</p>
              <p>Mr. BROWN moved to lay the motion on the table.</p>
              <p>His motion was rejected by, yeas 15, nays 27.</p>
              <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
              <p>Mr. GOODING when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said, he would
                like to see the widows' dower equal the amount exempted from sale on execution.</p>
              <p>Mr. ORR in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said he could not
                vote for the bill in its present shape because it makes too great a stride - from
                $500 to $1,000.</p>
              <p>Mr. SCOTT when his name was called said: I want to explain my vote. I do not
                understand this matter as some Senators here. I think a wife has this right in case
                of the death of her husband: If an execution is issued in the life time of the
                husband he has a right to claim the exemption, but suppose he dies with an execution
                in the hands of an officer, what becomes of it? Can he go on and seize the personal
                property? Of course he can't. The wife has a right to it, and the exemption can't
                take it. So for all the purposes of this Senate we don't need the amendment.</p>
              <p>Mr. WILLIAMS [interposing] referred to the act of February 19, 1859, where the
                officer is authorized to take articles not exceeding $500 in value.</p>
              <p>Mr. SCOTT. When the husband dies the Sheriff or Constable cannot take he personal
                property of the dead man.</p>
              <p>Mr. BROWN. I would like to suggest that this law would be a protection to the
                widow;to the woman if she out lives her husbandthat there will be $500 worth of
                property left.</p>
              <p>Mr. SCOTT. The question before the Senate is, whether in case of the death of a

                of the husband?</p>
              <pb n="316" xml:id="VAA8558-14-316"/>
              <p>I understand he cannot; therefore there is no necessity for the proposed amendment.
                There is no reason why the family should be deprived of the $500, while the husband
                lives. I therefore favor the motion to lay on the table.</p>
              <p>The vote was then announced, as above recorded.</p>
              <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Lawrence, made the point that Mr. Williams' motion was out of
                order, the question on the adoption of the report having been stated, and the
                Secretary ordered to call the roll before the motion was made.</p>
              <p>The Chair held the point well taken. Some discussion followed, when - </p>
              <p>Mr. BROWN moved to recommit to a special committee of three, with instructions to
                strike out $1,000 and insert $500.</p>
              <p>Mr. GOODING moved to amend by substituting $600, which Mr. Brown accepted.</p>
              <p>Mr. WILLIAMS moved ineffectually - yeas 17, nays 24that Mr. Brown's motion as
                amended, be laid on the table.</p>
              <p>The motion was then agreed to.</p>
              <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR at once announced the Committee viz: Messrs. Brown,
                Glessner and Hough.</p>
              <p>Mr. BROWN from this select Committee immediately reported in favor of striking out
                $1,000 and inserted $600, and recommended the passage of the bill. The report was
                concurred in, and the bill was passed by the following vote:</p>

                differing widely, and requiring a great deal of thought and investigation. He
                thought a Committee - ought to be sent to the mines to make an investigaion as to
                which is the better bill - the one pressed by the proprietors, or the one desired by
                the minors. The Committee on Rights and Privileges should carefully consider these

              <p>The SPEAKER laid before the House the Senate's concurrence in the House amendment
                to their resolution for the hearing of the American Women Suffrage Association
                changing the time from Thursday to Friday, 2 1-2 o'clock, P. M. with an amendment
                striking out "2 1-2 o'clock P. M." and inserting "10 o'clock A. M."</p>
              <p>Mr. SATTERWHITE. At the solicitation of the agent of the American Women Suffrage
                Association for a respectful hearing before the General Assembly he had submitted a
                resolution which passed the House which made the order for that hearing for Friday
                at 2 1-2 o'clock, P. M. But on yesterday some persons in behalf of the Indiana
                Women's Suffrage Association, procured the passage of a resolution on the part of
                the Senate fixing the time for their hearing on Thursday, at 2 o'clock; and that
                resolution came in here, and many gentleman - himself among them - did not know at
                the time it was considered but that it was for the hearing of the American Women's
                Association. It seemed to him to be an effort of the Indiana Association to
                superceed the American Association. So far as he was concerned he had no preference
                for either party here; but as the American Women's Suffrage Association applied
                first he considered that they should have the preference as to this appointment; and
                therefore he moved that the House refuse to concur in the Senate amendment. </p>

              <p>Mr. WALKERand Mr. BUTTERWORTH concurred in this matter with Mr. Satterwhite, and

              <p>The SPEAKER laid before the House the letter of the Secretary of State transmitting
                the message of Governor Baker containing the reasons for his veto of Mr. Gifford's
                bill, [H. R. 227] entitled: an act to provide for the payment to the township
                Trustees of all monies which may have been collected for either general or specific
                purposes, except such as may have been collected from townships for State and county
                revenue, and prescribing the punishment of officers failing to comply with the
                provisions of this act. The message was read by the clerk.</p>
              <p>The SPEAKER. The only order for the House to make now is that the Governor's
                objections be entered on the journal; and the only question is this: Will the House
                agree to to pass the bill the Governor's objections to the contrary

              <p>Mr. SHIRLEY reminded the House of his objections to the bill pending its
                consideration. The purpose of the bill was a good one - to enable parties who have
                voted railroad aid, and which has been forfeited, to divert it to the school fund.
                The bill was too broad in its provisions. He concurred in the reasoning of the veto
                message.</p>
              <p>Mr. WOODARD said the friends of the bill would not attempt to pass it over the

              <p>The SPEAKER now announced the second special order, to-wit: the consideration of
                Mr. Shirley's bills [H. R. 293 and 31,] and Mr. Billingsley's bill 290 with
                reference to the public printing, and the House determined to consider Mr. Shirley's
                bill [H. R. 293] first -(this bill being substituted by the Committee for Mr.
                Shirley's bill H. R. 9)it is entitled a bill to repeal an act fixing the time and
                mode of electing the State Printer defining his duties, fixing his compensation,
                etc., approved March 8, 1859, and to abolish the office of State Printer.</p>
              <p>Mr. WOODARD supposed that there was no division of sentiment in regard to this
                bill, all being pledged as partizans, on both sides, to abolish this office.</p>
              <p>Mr. SHIRLEY also desired the abolition of this office so that we can proceed to
                take such steps as may be expedient and wise in regard to the public printing for
                the future. He considered that we might be aided greatly in this matter by an

              <p>It was passed to the second reading.</p>
              <p>Mr. OFFUTT. I would like to know what has become of the concurrent resolution of
                the House for a declaration that we will not vote for a specific bill with an item
                to pay for newspapers? and the Senate message reporting the refusal of that body to
                concur?</p>
              <p>The SPEAKER. I think the resolution never went to the Special Committee. - It's on
                the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. OFFUTT. I do not like the shape this matter is taking, neither do I believe it
                is according to the sense of the House. There was a resolution submitted by the
                gentleman from Ripley [Mr. Wilson,] adopted by the House and non-concurred in by the
                Senate, that we would not vote for a bill having an item of appropriation for
                newspapers here, and pending that the gentleman from Johnson [Mr. Woollen]
                introduced his supplemental bill. The Speaker announced thereupon that the whole
                subject was referred to the Special Committee. I did not so understand the action of
                the House; and now it seems to me we ought to have a vote on that resolution. For if
                there was anything understood by me in that matter, it was that the <hi rend="i">per
                  diem</hi> bill cut off all perquisites - not a gentleman whom I have consulted but
                understood it in that way. Now suppose this bill introduced now by this Special
                Committee be passed by the House, what effect will that have on the other branch? I
                undertake to say it will have no effect whatever. Gentlemen may take their own
                course in this matter, and I will take mine. But I am not in favor of allowing this
                resolution of the gentleman from Ripley to be shut out in this way; and I say it is
                right and proper that we should have a vote on it. I am ready to pledge myself to
                vote against every specific bill that has in it an item to pay for newspapers
                furnished here. I want to vote on this subject now ; and regarding it as the
                question now before the House unfinished yesterday, I renew the motion, that the
                House adheres to that concurrent resolution.</p>
              <p>The SPEAKER. The gentleman can move to take that message from the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. OFFUTT. I make that motion.</p>
              <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. The act that we passed does not cut off the furnishing of newspapers;
                and it is not worth while for us to say that it does; for it does not, though it
                might be understood in that way; but it does not do it. The bill is, that members
                shall furnish their own stationery, without cost to the State therefor. Now we all
                understood that that bill would cut off newspapers. That was the general
                understanding. That is the way I explained it to my constituents when I went home;
                and now, gentlemen here subscribe for newspapers on their own account. But now, when
                our resolution goes into the Senate, they refuse to concur in it, because they say
                it would violate their contract with the newspaper publishers - for in matter of law
                they have the right to do as to them may seem to be expedient. But if this bill were
                to pass the House and the Senate, that would be an end, by law, of all contracts for
                furnishing newspapers for members of the General Assembly. But to take up this
                resolution, and press its consideration would not amount to anything. It seems to me
                also, that the resolution undertakes to construe the law against the very terms of
                the law; and if it were passed a dozen times, it would still have the terms of the
                law as they are now. But let us rather consider and pass this bill; and then, if the
                Senate should refuse to pass our bill, and it becomes necessary for us to get up an
                issue with the Senate on this matter,why then the indignation of the gentleman from
                Hancock (Mr. Offutt) can have full play - and I will help him. I thing that we
                should not insist on any conference on this matter, unless it becomes absolutely
                necessary.</p>
              <p>Mr. WOODARD. It was my understanding at the time, that the <hi rend="i">per
                  diem</hi> bill cut off everything; and that is my understanding of the intention
                to-day. But I know now, that under a strict construction it will not express that;
                and therefore I think the best thing will be to pass this bill. While the Senate may
                have the advantage of us in the law as enacted, we have got the advantage of them in
                the matter of appropriation. It is not right that we should have constructive fees
                here.</p>
              <p>Mr. COBB. This was a concurrent resolution, and, the other House refusing to concur
                it is dead to all intents and purposes.</p>
              <p>Mr. COWGILL. My understanding when we passed the <hi rend="i">per diem</hi> bill
                was, that it provided the only pay we should have. That was my understanding, or I
                should not have voted for it. And now seeing the constructions which gentlemen
                desire to place upon it. I am emphatically in favor of the repeal of the law. </p>
              <pb n="321" xml:id="VAA8558-14-321"/>
              <p>But why increase our pay by voting ourselves papers? and I confess that I have not
                been able to find authority for doing anything of that kind. - All I desire by this
                resolution is to express our understanding of the <hi rend="i">per diem</hi> bill;
                so that the Senate may have notice that if they make a contract for newspapers they
                may expect this body to refuse to help them to carry out the contract. I am in favor
                of passing this resolution also because it places a just construction on the law and
                declares our understanding in regard to it.</p>
              <p>Mr. RICHARDSON. The resolution will not cure the defect; nothing short of the bill
                will cure it. We have but just now passed an enrolled act appropriating $125,000 for
                Legislative expenses; and if the Senate have a mind to do so they can pay for these
                newspapers out of that.</p>
              <p>Mr.MELLETT. It is true that the <hi rend="i">per diem</hi> bill cuts off
                stationery, and my understanding is, that it was under this item of "stationery"
                that all our extra allowances were made, including the pocket knives; and I wish to
                show the House another thing for the benefit of gentlemen who have not had
                experience of these drawings of extras.(He held in his hand a cork-screw, and under
                difficulties about the working of the rusty springs made a fair exhibition of the
                instrument to the indignant benches.)The idea of drawing such an article of
                "stationery" as that for the benefit of our constituents, or for the purpose of
                benefiting legislation! Now sir, in view of this, I am in faver of passing the
                pending resolution, and I am also in favor of the bill of the gentleman from Johnson
                (Mr. Woollen.) This word "stationery" includes almost everything; for if it included
                that, (the cork-screw) it would include anything. (A voice"Greenbacks.") Yes; it
                included their greenbacks also - anything you may see fit to apply it to. And when
                the <hi rend="i">per diem</hi> bill was introduced, I thought it would cut off these
                anythings ; and since it has not yet had the desired effect, I am in favor of
                construing the act for the benefit of our brethren in the other end of the building.
                And since gentlemen in the other end have become so very indignant as to our
                estimation of this matter of voting themselves allowances, let us test them and see
                whether their indignation was sincere.</p>
              <p>Mr. TULLEY. I am decidedly in favor of adhering to this resolution, and I hope it
                will not be passed over this time.</p>
              <p>The SPEAKER. The question is: Will the House take up the message from the Senate?
                (It was decided in the affirmative on a division - affirmative 48, negative 32.) The
                message will be read.</p>
              <p>The message was read by the Clerk, announcing the Senate's refusal to concur in Mr.
                Wilson's concurrent resolution.</p>
              <p>Mr. OFFUTT. I now renew the motion submitted yesterday by the gentleman from Ripley
                (Mr. Willson) that the House adhere to that resolution; and on that I desire to make
                a few remarks. I fell that, perhaps, I have already said more on this question than
                I ought to say, but it is a question in which I feel an interest. I feel that if I
                did not adhere to this resolution - that, as a member of this House after we have
                said and done what we have on this <hi rend="i">per diem</hi> bill that if I should
                now vote for newspapers or stationery, it would place me in a false position. I know
                that there is no view of this matter that could have induced me to vote for that
                bill, had I not understood that it cast off all perquisites. I believe there is no
                controversy about tha not a man on the floor but understood it so at that time.
                There is but a single voice opposed to saying that was the proper construction of
                the law. Now, after all thisin the light of all these facts - I ask gentlemen if
                they can vote for an appropriation to pay for newspapers? It is said by the
                gentleman from Gibson (Mr. Buskirk) that the act does not cut off newspapers. I
                undertake then to say that there never was a statute that authorized the taking of
                newspapers here unless it was that provision which authorizes "stationery" for
                members. Then, if "stationery" is cut off, does it not follow that newspapers are
                cut off also ? But now; irrespective of all this, I undertake to say : that there is
                no pleading, no answer, no argument that ought to stand against the plain
                understanding of members who voted for the <hi rend="i">per diem</hi> bill. It is
                time enough to construe a law when it comes into court, arid before a judge who had
                nothing to do with the making of it; and it comes with a bad grace for a gentleman -
                a member of the House of Representatives - to stand here and allege that this law
                does not cut off newspapers, when we all know that in the estimates and calculations
                submitted on this floor at the time as to the comparative expense of the Legislature
                under the old law and the <hi rend="i">per diem</hi> bill, they all included the
                item of newspapers. They argued that the <hi rend="i">per diem</hi> bill would make
                no increase of the pay of members, but only proposed a different mode of payment. It
                was urged also by the gentleman from Gibson that this resolution is an interference
                with the rights of the Senate - that they have a right to take the newspapers at the
                public expense, but, fortunately for justice, they can't make an appropriation for
                these papers unless the House concur. I propose to stand by the law, as I voted for
                it. Again, it has been said that a vote on this resolution will not settle this
                question - that it will come up again in the future; and hence it is urged that we
                must pass the bill introduced by the21 <pb n="322" xml:id="VAA8558-14-322"/>
                gentleman from Johnson, (Mr. Woollen.) But I can't see it yet quite in that light. I
                am in favor of the bill, and I mean to vote for it; but what I mean to say is this:
                that a vote on this bill, and its passage will not settle the question so far as
                this session is concerned, and I want the question settled for this session. Then
                after we shall have decided this question for this session, by the adoption of this
                resolution - then I shall be ready and willing to vote for the bill introduced by
                the gentleman from Johnson. I insist also that we may properly vote for this
                resolution and it seems to me that we ought to do it at once. It seems to me that we
                would stultify ourselves if we did not. And I can't conceive how it is that
                gentlemen will vote for allowing papers for Senators, while refusing them to
                themselves. For I undertake to say that any gentleman on this floor, is the peer of
                any Senator ; and that if it is right and proper for members of the Senate to have
                these papers, then it is right and proper for every member of this House to have
                them: and while I am not in favor of voting them to ourselves, I am not in favor of
                voting them for the other end of the capitol. Gentlemen may take their own course ;
                and gentlemen may talk about the expression of my indignation ; it is not mine, but
                the indignation of the people; because I have no indignation in the matter. It is my
                sense of right and justice in opposition to this thing ; my judgment tells me it is
                wrong; and whether gentlemen consider it indignation or not, I shall pursue this
                course. My mind is made up. I want to go upon the record, and I want every gentleman
                in the House to go upon the record, in reference to this matter. I know that to vote
                for the newspapers either in the House or Senate will not meet the approbation of
                the people. When I went home I was confronted with the question : Why did you
                increase your pay ? And I undertook to show the people that the <hi rend="i">per
                  diem</hi> bill was no increase of pay ; that under the practice before that, we
                received what amounted to about eight dollars per day that we received so much then
                indirectly; whereas now we receive that amount directly. And, sir, I insist that, if
                that is the law, and members will still vote themselves newspapers under the item of
                "stationery," it will not meet the approbation of the people. Mr. CLARK. When I
                voted on that <hi rend="i">per diem</hi> bill I did not understand that it excluded
                newspapers. I thought it was cutting oil simply what we get from the Secretary of
                State. I did believe then that the law will bear the construction put upon it - that
                it allowed gentlemen to vote themselves newspapers. Not that it is right, therefore,
                but as a matter of comity toward the Senate, it seems to me that the House might
                retire from its action on this resolution. And there is another thing: the Senators
                here voted themselves these statutes; and we have got them also; and my
                understanding of that matter was, that we are to keep them.</p>
              <p>Mr. COBB. I have been at a loss to understand the position of the House as to this
                concurrent resolution; but I think I understand it now. We passed a concurrent
                resolution here; and the Senate refuses to concur, and they have sent it back; then
                we pass it over again; and then it becomes good law. That being now my clear
                understanding I demand the previous question.</p>
              <p>There was a second to the demand for the previous question and the main question
                was ordered viz : Will the House adhere to tin concurrent resolution ? and the
                question was decided in the affirmative yeas 74, nays 9 - so the House of
                Representatives adhered to the concurrent resolution.</p>
              <p>The SPEAKER now again pursued the call of the House by counties and districts

            <p>Mr. BUSKIRK, from the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>, returned Mr.
              Butterworth's bill [H. R. 143] for an act to amend section 1 of the act to incorporate
              the University of Notre Dame du Lac in St. Joseph Co., near South Bend, Ind., approved
              January 15, 1844, with a recommendation that it pass; but qualifying so as to express
              the preference of the committee to report the bill with this recommendation and
              leaving the place blank where it is written - "$300,000," as the maximum limitation of
              the amount of real estate which the corporator may hold. He said: The bill provides
              that the corporation shall be permitted to hold real estate to the amount of $300,000,
              while the committee were not prepared to say what this limitation should be. They
              agreed to report the bill back with a favorable recommendation, but so as that the
              amount may be fixed by the House at the suggestion of the framer or the bill or some
              one else.</p>
            <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH. At the proper time I shall move to put in "$300,000."The bill was
              now read by the clerk.Mr. BUTTERWORTH. The reason why I would make it $300,000 is
              this: their real property has become very valuable - this institution being near the
              city of South Bend. It is a Catholic School - one of the largest in the United States,
              embracing in its departments of learning a manual Labor School.Their charter now
              allows them to hold real estate to the value of $30,000; but the people of the country
              around have become wealthy, and their real estate original and acquired is now
              actually worth about $300,000; and the difficulty is, that they can't hold it under
              their present charter.</p>
            <p>Mr. HENDERSON. There is no difference in the purport of this bill and that which I
              introduced during the last session - the bill No. 195. This is a leading Catholic
              Institution - the foremost in the State. - Sometime in 1841, I think it was, these
              agents purchased a tract of land in St. Joseph county, when land was cheap, and
              thereon they built this University and were incorporated in 1844. Since that time all
              real estate there has increased in value. Under their old charter, $30,000 worth of
              real estate was all they could hold. But now they hold real estate to a much larger
              amount. I presume their real property to be actually worth at least $300,000. And as
              the bill cannot effect any other Institution or any other people than the people of
              St. Joseph county, I hope the report of the committee so fas as the blank is concerned
              will not be concurred in; and that the bill will be passed with the provision for
              $300,000 or that that amount will be restored to the bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. GIVAN. It seems to me that the proper question is: shall the report of the
              committee be concurred in so far as the <pb n="324" xml:id="VAA8558-14-324"/>
              recommendation as to the blank is concerned.</p>
            <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. The committee intended to report in favor of the passage of the bill,
              but were not prepared to say as to what should be the proper amount of real estate
              that should be held by the corporation. Therefore we thought it best to refer this
              question to the House. The report recommends the bill in its general features, but
              this amount $300,000 is ten times as large as $30,000 - and whilst it was the mind of
              the committee that the House ought to bo satisfied as to that point, it now seems to
              the that the amount is not too large.</p>
            <p>Mr. HENDERSON. To leave out the amount of $300,000 would destroy the bill. Now it
              seems to me that it ought to be sufficient to satisfy the House to say that my
              colleague and myself have canvassed this matter thoroughly among our constituents, and
              they are satisfied that the institution could not well get along with less.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. There is a law now in force in this State that deprives other
              educational institutions of the privilege which this bill proposes. As individual
              corporations are debarred from increasing their real estate beyond $40,000 the
              committee thought these institutions should be placed on an equality in this respect -
              which could not be the case if we allow this institution to hold $300,000 worth,
              whilst all the others are restricted to $40,000. That is where the trouble grew up in
              the committee on corporations. We thought it impolitic to give the right to one
              institution to hold $300,000 and deny that right to all others.</p>
            <p>Mr. HENDERSON. It is not the intention of this bill to give them $300,000, but it is
              to so amend their charter as to enable them to keep what they have got.</p>
            <p>Mr. BUTTURWORTH. There is a law which confines the ownership of real estate by such
              institutions to $40,000. But this bill is for the amendment of a special charter,
              which does not come under the general statute. I think with the gentleman from Morgan
              and Johnson, (Mr. Shirley,) that all these institutions should be placed on an
              equality ; but considering that this is a special charter; and that charter allows
              them to hold but the insufficient amount of $30,000 in real estate; and that all
              beyond that amount must be held for them in trust by individuals, I think their rights
              in this respect ought to be increased - especially since they can in no way conflict
              with the general interests of the state; but on the contrary this is an institution
              beneficial to the people and it is very creditable to the State. The University of
              Notre Dame du Lac stands highest among the Catholic institutions, and prominent among
              all the institutions of learning in the West. This bill will in no way relieve them
              from taxation; and the people of our county do not object to it for it is well
              understood there that the necessity for this amendment grows out of the fact before
              stated that their lands have become very valuable.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. Are all these lands used by that Institution?</p>
            <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH. They are all used by the Institution. They are a brotherhood - their
              lands are used for farming.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. It seems to me that we ought to grant the right to any Institution of
              learning to hold an amount of property that is necessary for the purposes ef education
              therein, whether it be $40,000 or $300,000. The purpose of the committee as I
              understand it, was simply to ascertain whether the property was held for the purpose
              of enabling them to operate strictly as an Institution of learning, and to let them
              have property of sufficient value fer that purpose.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLSON of Ripley. It seems to me that to pass this bill would be the exercise of
              a very dangerous power, I cannot consent for this Legislature to secure to them the
              power to increase the value of their property to an amount exceeding that which they
              can hold by law. This granting of special privileges to ecclesiastical institutions is
              against the policy of this government. We have only to point back a few centuries to
              the example of England in this direction to see how these institutions engrossed
              nearly all the property of the kingdom.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. That is going to far, this is simply to give them the right to hold the
              property they have now.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLSON. If that is all why not provide simply that they shall not be divested of
              their title to property on account of increase of value? That could be easily done.
              But if we give them tho power to increase the value of their property to $300,000, -
              we might as well say three millions, or three hundred millions. It is dangerous,
              because it takes that property out of commerceit makes it dead property; and I say
              again we have a parallel case in England. We have a number of institutions of learning
              in this State, and they will all come in asking for the same increase of powers. I
              feel and see the danger to which we may drift, and that the present is not the last
              nor the least grant of power that will be asked, and if we extend it now, it will be
              an admission that we may do so indefinitely.</p>
            <p>Mr. THAYER. I do not think the gentleman from Ripley understand the case. If he did
              understand it I do not think he would make an unkind speech with regard to the
              Institution. The value of the property of this institution has increased and so has
              the value of <pb n="325" xml:id="VAA8558-14-325"/> the institution itself; and the
              number of its students has very greatly increased, and the institution has done a
              great deal of gooda great many citizen of the State sending their boys there obtain
              for them a good practical education. This institution is near the city of South Bend,
              and the land which they purchased there thirty or forty years ago for $2 50 an acre is
              now worth $250 00 an acre. Instead of repelling them we should confess and avow that
              these manual labor schools are the very things we want. We should do this rather than
              intimate that they are greedy of large amounts of property and withholding it from
              commerce. As for myself, whenever I have an opportunity to give my vote for the
              benefit of the children of the State, it will not be withheld.</p>
            <p>Mr. OGDEN. I have nothing to say against the institutions of learning in the State.
              So far as my vote goes, it shall be given in aid of those institutions. But I believe
              it bad policy to foster such institutions by special laws. I would disabuse the mind
              of the gentlemen from Morgan and Johnson (Mr. Shirley) of this one thing: and that is,
              that the general laws allow these institutions but $40,000. This is not the case. They
              can hold any amount under the law of 1867. But I believe that this law if passed would
              be unconstitutional. The constitution says all laws shall be uniform in their
              operation. And if this institution could acquire nothing but what they had under their
              special charter, I believe they could come under the provisions of the special
              law.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. I made my statement on the authority of the gentleman from Putnam
              himself.</p>
            <p>Mr. OGDEN. The gentleman had better examine the law for himself.</p>
            <p>Mr. HENDERSON. The property has increased in value, and it is all used for the
              benefit of the institution. They have large farms and shops for laborers. Scarcely a
              trade but is represented there. They are all the time full of students. They only want
              to keep what they have got. They have improved their property and could not very well
              divide it.</p>
            <p>Mr. COBB. My impression is that the phraseology of the bill is different from the
              speech of the gentlemen. I, like the gentleman from Ripley, (Mr. Willson,) want to act
              a little cautious in this matter, knowing the general character of these institutions
              for public encroachments. I would like to go slow in this matter, and weigh the
              provisions of the bill pretty thoroughly. Therefore I would like to have it printed. I
              make the motion to lay it on the table and print.</p>
            <p>Mr. MILLER. I could be willing to do almost anything for such an excellent
              institution, but I have peculiar views in regard to these corporate privileges. I am
              opposed to the recommendations of the committee. We must have some general policy in
              regard to these corporations. We should be admonished of the past before we proceed
              further in granting additional franchises to these corporations, by way of amendments
              to heso special charters of institutions incorporated before the taking effect of our
              present Constitution. There is a clause in the Constitution of the U. S. that has
              given rise to many law suits growing out of statutes of the character of that which
              this bill proposes to amend ; and it says that no law shall be enacted by any State
              that will impair the obligations of contracts. And the Supreme Courts of the U. S. the
              Supreme Court of the State of Indiana, and nearly every other State in the Union have
              decided that this clause of the general Constitution applies to powers granted to
              corporations so that if a State grants certain franchises to a corporation they are
              inviolable - they can't be taken back without the consent of the corporation - and I
              am obliged to say that this is becoming the bane of legislation in the State of
              Indiana,these private privileged corporations. When we undertake to pass a railroad
              law we are met with the claim that such and such Railroads are operated under special
              charters, and like the Jeffersonville Co. they will put off a passenger between
              stations with impunity. We provide that such a thing cannot be done; and the Supreme
              Court decides that our statute does not apply to the Jeffersonville Company.He showed
              further from the case of Edwards against Jackson, 19th Ind. Reps. p. 476, where a
              private seminary had been incorporated as the Switzerland County Seminary, previous to
              the adoption of the Constitution of 1850, that neither the constitutional provission
              requiring the sale of the County Seminaries and the proceeds to go to the common
              school fund, nor the act of the General Assembly in pursuance thereof could dispossess
              those private corporators, and the result was that the Supreme Court held a section of
              the Constitution itself to be unconstitutional and void in regard to those corporate
              rights. And he reasoned further to show that these tendencies in our legislation were
              like revolutions they never go backward. It becomes utterly beyond the power of the
              Legislature to alter or amend these special charters so as to protect the people
              against their encroachments. Hence the wisdom of Article xi, Section 13 of our present
              State Constitution, which prescribes that corporations, other than banking, shall not
              be created by special act, but may be formed under general laws, for which the other
              day here the Vice President of the U. S. claimed <pb n="326" xml:id="VAA8558-14-326"/>
              special credit in behalf of the Constitutional Convention of 1850, - because it is
              against public policy - against the policy of the State to grant these private
              charters. Now, if it is not good policy (and I have no question about it in my mind -
              ) to grant these private charters, why should we entertain this proposition to take
              the corporators of an old charter and increase their money power from $30,000 to
              $300,000?thus making a mountain out of a mole-hill. If this should not be done in the
              beginning, why should we increase the franchises of a corporation already in
              existence? He then referred to and read from the decision of the Supreme Court of the
              U. S. in Dartmouth College case and quoted the opinion of a professor in the Law
              School of Michigan University, and alleged that the same principle is involved here
              which was, as he thought, unwisely acted upon at the last session, in the grant of
              power to a certain Insurance Company to water their stock, etc. He insisted that the
              Notre Dame folks could come in and organize under our general corporation law, and
              hold all the property they need, and so hold their corporate existence subject to the
              Legislature - to alter, repeal etc. He would leave tbem to the enjoyment of the same
              advantages allowed to all other corporations. He continued: Again, I question the
              policy of allowing them to hold $300,000 worth of real property, exclusive of
              improvements. Then I understand that they are not subject to taxation; and therefore,
              besides their chronic hostility to the common schools, they do not contribute one cent
              to the school fund of the State. As for myself, sir, while I am a member of this
              honorable body, whenever a special charter comes before the House asking to become
              perpetual, or for an increase of franchise, I shall vote all the time and uniformly
              against everything of the kind.</p>
            <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. In behalf of the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, I desire to
              answer some of the remarks that have fallen from the gentleman from Decatur (Mr.
              Miller.) He has taken it upon himself to edify the House on the subject of these
              institutions in general. He has deemed it necessary to explain to the House the
              Dartmouth College case, and the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States, to
              the effect, that after certain franchises have been granted an institution of this
              character, they can not be taken away by the action of the Legislature. He might have
              said further that in that celebrated Dartmouth College case Daniel Webster made a
              speech, in which he sees proper to make an attack upon institutions of this character
              which, in its general features bore a close resemblance to the attack made this
              morning by the gentleman from Decatur. Now it seems to me that in making this assault
              upon the recipients of certain vested rights that the gentleman has drawn upon the
              time of the House for the consideration of what is not at all before the House - that
              he has been breaking his lance against a wind mill. It seems to me that there is not a
              proposition in this bill which is in any way connected with the learned opinions of
              the Supreme Court of the U. S. to which the gentleman refers; because no one can
              hardly be willing to take away property belonging to the institution at South Bend.
              The property which is sought to be covered by this bill hag long been owned by that
              institution. It is not intended to confer any power to acquire new property. It is
              simply and abundantly shown here, that $300,000 in full does not more than cover the
              value of the property now owned by that institution. As I understand it, this
              institution now holds by sufferance all this real estate in excess of $30,000, and
              this bill is simply to give a law for them to own and possess what they now hold by
              sufferance and if we refuse this it will be refusing to them the right to hold their
              own property. We do not propose to give to that corporation any new right, nor to
              confer on them any new or peculiar privilege; but simply to recognize the legal claim
              they have to the land they now hold. While the <orgName>Committee on the
                Judiciary</orgName> is prepared to leave the amount to the gentleman from St. Joseph
              (Mr. Butterworth) the gentleman from St. Joseph goes upon the record and says that
              $300,000 only represents the amount of property they now actually hold. The gentleman
              from Decatur also takes occasion to make an assault on all institutions of this kind,
              and intimates that we must regard them with the utmost jealousy. I can't see what that
              has to do with this bill; for the only other institution of thin kind which is to come
              before the House with such a request is the female Catholic Institution near Terre
              Haute. He either means in this way to occupy the House with matter which has no
              relevancy to the issue before the House; or he would illustrate Don Quixotte and
              remind us of one of the adventures of that chivalrous Knight, when he found himself in
              a chamber where there were numerous large leather butts of winelarge leather caskets;
              and he imagined them to be giants or demons (just as the gentleman regards the
              institution at South Bend;) so he drew out his sword and began to fight them, and the
              result was that the stores of precious wine were spilled on the floor. And such I
              suppose is to be the result of the gentleman's unsheathing his creanehant sword to-day
              to deprive this institution at South Bend of property which they have acquired as <pb
                n="327" xml:id="VAA8558-14-327"/> honestly as the gentleman ever acquired any
              property of his own.</p>
            <p>Mr. COBB. According to the phraseology of this bill, if they do not hold $300,000
              worth of property, would it not be authority to them to go on and purchase other
              property and hold it to the extent of $300,000?</p>
            <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. Undoubtedly it would. That is the reason of the report submitted from
              the committee on corporations, and the occasion of the remarks that has been submitted
              by gentlemen in regard to the amount of property belonging to that institution.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLSON of Ripley. If gentlemen are really in earnest, and do not desire this
              corporation to purchase and hold property beyond what they now have, I will offer an
              amendment that would make it incapable of doing so, I move to recommit the bill to the
              committee on the Judiciary with instructions to amend it, by providing that they may
              purchase and hold property to any amount not exceeding in value that which is
              prescribed in their charter. I think there can be no possible objection loan amendment
              of this kind. Now, we have another similar application from the Catholic Institution
              at Terre Haute. I do not see why we should grant privileges to to them which we do not
              extend to other similar institutions. I will stand on this amendment.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. Under the general law the North Western Christian University here at
              Indianapolis holds property perhaps to the extent of half a million, I would not
              discriminate between these institutions. It seems to me that the bill proposes to give
              to the Notre Dame no more than what all other religious colleges have. I do not think
              we ought to make record here of a feeling that would discriminate against any of them.
              So long as they hold property only for the enjoyment of their corporate powers, let
              them have it. Or, if we do not thus, what shall we do with these institutions? Shall
              we abolish them? or any certain class of them? A very few acres of land in some places
              would be worth more than the amount proposed in this bill. This Institution simply
              conies here and asks to have the law changed so that they may hoid the properly thev
              have now.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLSON of Ripley. If the bill is amended as I propose it will give all you
              ask.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. I think the bill accomplishes what you desire any way, and the
              recommitment may put it in such a nhape that it will discriminate against this
              institution.</p>
            <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH. I move to lay the motion to recommit with instructions on the
              table.</p>
            <p>The motion was rejected on a division.</p>
            <p>Mr. WALKER. I see no use in referring the the bill again to the <orgName>Judiciary
                Committee</orgName>.</p>
            <p>Mr. MELLETT. I hope the amendment to the bill will prevail. I think it is all its
              friends can ask. I am opposed to any extension of the powers and franchizes of these
              corporations. I think the policy is unfriendly to society and inimical to
              Republicanism, And although the corporation may be a church, still I am unwilling to
              enlarge the controlling power in it. There was weight in the remark of the gentleman
              from Decatur, that the world has had experience of abuses of the power which is asked
              in this bill. I shall vote against the bill, unless the amendment of the gentleman for
              Ripley is applied to it .It will provide that they shall hold this property in their
              own lawful right. It may be that this Institution has been acquiring property by
              indirection. But in any event the effect of the bill will be to make an extension of
              their powers; and so in time we may have an Institution here controlling millions of
              dollars; and therefore every point should be guarded against its advancement in power
              to a point that might take it beyond the control of the State of Indiana. I think we
              ought to act here as with knowledge that we are conferring powers on an unfriendly
              institution.</p>
            <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. I do not like to weary the House, but there is a point involved here. I
              understand that, a portion of the property which this bill proposes to confer is now
              held indirectly by trustees. Now, it is possible, and even probable, if this amendment
              prevails, that it will destroy the bill, and so far as its adoption would go to secure
              the House against the imputation of favoriteism, I would say that the only object of
              the amendment, at best, is to make it sure that the Institution will not hold property
              beyond the limitation of their charter, and I think we have ample assurance of this
              from the statements of gentlemen from St. Joseph and that region. They have given us
              the assurance that this amendment allowing them $300,000 only represents the actual
              amount of property held by them, and the House ought to rely upon these statements.
              Assuredly, if the proposed amendment would destroy the bill it ought not to prevail
              and as to the facts, I desire to hear from those who are bettor informed than
              myself.</p>
            <p>Mr. COBB. I propose to amend the motion to recommit, by adding instructions to amend
              so that the corporation may hold the property they now have, but it shall not be
              applied to making additional purchases. He said: I think, with this amendment, that
              the bill will give them all that its friends should ask. I am in favor of saying what
              we mean in <pb n="328" xml:id="VAA8558-14-328"/> the law itself, so as to avoid coming
              in here with resolutions explaining what we mean by a law which we have passed. If
              this is not what these parties want, let them revise it - let them draw their bill
              again, and make it say precisely what they do want. I am in favor of square honorable
              dealing in this bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. The gentleman's amendment is out of order. There is already before the
              House a motion to recommit with instructions.</p>
            <p>Mr. SPEAKER. The gentleman from Huntington offers additional instructions.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. I have to some extent changed my mind. I am told that there is a
              beautiful lake on the hinds belonging to this Institution, and I believe that every
              such Institution ought to have the right to hold enough real property to enable them
              to carry out the object of the institution, and no more, and if it is necessary for
              them (and I am told it is) I am willing that they should hold to the extent of
              $300,000.</p>
            <p>Mr. HENDERSON. The property of this Institution is scattered - some of it miles
              apart. If the House require them to hold only the property they now hold, they can't
              make the changes they desire in the building and other property of the University.</p>
            <p>Mr. GIVAN. I understand that this Institution has operated under a special charter
              for some thirty years. Times have changed since and they have changed. All public
              improvements and the price of property have advanced. Society has changed and there is
              a new order of things, and this institution and all others must necessarily conform to
              these changes. Hence, we find many of them acting under special charters applying to
              the Legislature, time and again for amendments of their charters. At the last session
              of the Legislature, I remember two or three instances which we passed upon for the
              increase of the capital stock of Insurance Companies to $500,000 I believe. So long as
              we can do this, I submit that it is a little remarkable to see gentlemen so sensitive
              on the question of an increase of capital when an Educational Institution comes in
              asking for if, and telling us that they are restricted to $30,000, and their property
              ban so increased in value that they cannot hold it. Why are gentlemen so sensitive as
              to this Institution? and when a purely moneyed corporation comes in asking for an
              increase of capital there is hardly a dissenting voice to the granting of what they
              ask. Gentlemen talk about this Institution being dangerous to public liberty. I
              affirm, sir, that it has not been the Institutions of this class, but it has been the
              great moneyed monopolies of the world that have given to all men occasion to guard
              against them and the encroachments of their power. It seems to me that what is asked
              for in this bill is a plain right, and should be granted by the General Assembly.</p>
            <p>Mr. THAYER moved ineffectually it, lay the motion to recommit the bill with
              instructions to amend it on the the table - yeas 43, nays 45.</p>
            <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH. The instructions for amendment proposed by the gentleman from Ripley
              are so indefinite and confused that I can see neither point nor sense in the
              motion.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLSON of Ripley. The point in my amendment is this: If they have violated their
              charter it is forfeited under my amendment.</p>
            <p>Mr COBB. The amendment which I offered is, that they may hold the property they now
              have not exceeding: $300,000.</p>
            <p>The motion to recommit with the instructions to amend was agreed to on a division of
              the House - affirmatives 46, negatives 43.So the bill was referred again to the
              Committee.</p>

            <p>The bill (H. R. 293) to repeal the act fixing the time and mode of electing a State
              Printer, and abolishing the office, coming up in regular order, it was read for the
              first time.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE moved to suspend the rules in order that the bill might be read the second
              time now.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN hoped the rules would not be suspended. This was a very important bill and
              the members ought to be allowed to sleep on it one night at least.</p>
            <p>Mr. O'BRIEN said it was an easy matter to pass this bill, but if you abolish the
              office of State Printer and provide no substitute for it we will be in rather a
              difficult position in reference to getting the printing done. He was, however, in

            <p>Mr. BROWN. SO am I.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE said the bill passed the House unanimously, for the reason that if the
              matter was allowed to drag along for any considerable time, under the present law, a

            <p>Mr. GREGG said the bill only makes clear what is in doubt as to the jurisdiction of

              for the third reading - the endorsement thereon failing to show that fact. Several

            counties and townships by taking stock therein, recommending that it lie on the
            table.</p>
          <p>Mr. MILLER whose bill it is, said: I believe the Chairman will agree with me that it is
            a good bill, and that it is in proper form. The only object in offering this report
            to-day to lay it on the table is to make the bill an amendment to another railroad bill
            before the House (Mr. Branhams.) It makes some radical changes in the law in regard to
            railroad aid by counties and townships, and there may be some difficulty or delay about
            its passage, while the necessity for this bill is imminent in my own county as well as
            in many others. It applies where the tax has been levied and part of it collected, and
            where they desire to have the tax stopped because the railroad has not been benefitted.
            He gave existing cases where the passage of such a law as the bill contemplates is
            desirable.</p>
          <p>Mr. KING did not think the passage of the bill would do any injury.</p>

            <head rend="center">[Morning Session.]</head>
            <p>Mr. GREGG called up the special order for this hour, being his bill, [S. 4] to
              provide for the taxing of all banks, national as well as others, for municipal
              purposes.</p>
            <p>The report of a majority of the <orgName>Committee on Banks</orgName> was also read,
              recommending the passage of a substitute, which simply provides that bank stock shall
              be taxed for municipal and all other purposes in the same manner as other personal
              property, and that where the stockholder is not an inhabitant of the State the stock
              shall be taxed where the bank is situated, otherwise, where the stockholder
              resides.</p>
            <p>A minority report was also read recommending the passage of the original bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. GREGG hoped the minority report would be adopted and Senate Bill No. 4 passed.
              The substitute bill is defective in many of its provisions. It has no provision by
              which the city authorizes may ascertain - the amount of capital stock, the number of -
              shares it is divided into, and names of stockholders, the amount held by each one,
              etc. The original bill contains such a provision, requiring the sworn statement of the
              officers as to these facts. This provision he deemed essential to the effectiveness of
              the bill, and its absence from the substitute bill was a fatal defect. Again, the
              original bill makes the tax an absolute lien on the shares of stock, which insures its
              easy and certain collection from both residents and non-residents. Still further, the
              substitute bill provides that a stockholder, who is a resident of the State but not of
              the city where the bank is situated, shall be exempted from taxation in said city.
              This he believed was unfair. All the property in a city should be subject to taxation
              for municipal purposes. He caused to be read a clause from a law passed by Congress in
              1872, expressly declaring that national bank stock may be taxed for State, county and
              municipal purposes, provided that the taxes asssessed shall not be at a greater rate
              than is levied upon other monied capital, and that the shares of non-residents of the
              State shall be taxed in the town or city where the bank is located. This, he said,
              disposes of the vexed question whether national bank stock might be taxed for State,
              county and municipal purposes. He had been told that the amount of national bank stock
              in Indianapolis is over $7,000,000. As the rate of taxation for municipal purposes is
              1 1-2 per cent. Indianapolis loses annualy by the present exemption of that stock
              stock over $100,000. The same may be said, though of course the figures would be less,
              of other cities in the State.</p>
            <p>While on this subject he called attention to an act passed in 1871, to provide for
              common schools in cities of 30,000 inhabitants and over. It might have been entitled a
              bill to provide for common schools, in the city <pb n="332" xml:id="VAA8558-14-332"/>
              of Indianapolis, for no other city in the State has the requisite number of
              inhabitants to take the benefit of the act. This bill provides that the school tax
              shall be levied as a muni-icipal tax, and the levy may be twenty-five cents on the
              hundred dollars of taxable property. The school tax being levied as a municipal tax,
              and no law being enforced to subject bank stock to municipal taxes, of course for the
              last two years this great amount of National Bank stock has laid clear of school tax
              in the city of Indianapolis and the school fund of that city has lost very largely
              thereby probably from seventeen to twenty thousand dollars annually.</p>
            <p>He believed it to be the imperative duty of the Legislature to provide for the equal
              taxation of all property in the State, as required by section 1, Article X, of the
              State Constitution, in the following language:"</p>
            <p>The General Assembly shall provide, by law, for a uniform and equal rate of
              assessment and taxation ; and shall prescribe such regulations as shall secure a just
              valuation for taxation of all property, both real and personal, excepting such only
              for municipal, educational, literary, scientific, religious or charitable purposes, as
              may be specially exempted by law."</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN was not much in favor of the principle embodied in the bill, even if the
              enactment would be legal, which he doubted. The original law of Congress, for the
              incorporation of national banks, provided that the stock should not be taxed other
              than that of the Slate banks was taxed, and the charter of the Bank of the State of
              Indiana provides that its stock shall not be taxed for municipal purposes. Since that
              there have been some other laws of Congress with which he was not very familiar. But
              it is questionable whether they interfere at all with the original act. At any rate it
              is a very grave question whether the banks that organized under the original law of
              Congress, and before any of these subsequent acts were passed in reference to the
              taxing of their stocks, can be taxed in this State beyond the taxes that were
              authorized by law at the time of their incorporation. Even if the late law of Congress
              does provide for the levying and collection of taxes for municipal purposes, it is a
              question whether they can be levied or collected on banks organized under the original
              law. Again, he was not in favor of taxing a man who lives out of a city and owns a few
              shares of stock in a city bank, for the purpose of keeping up the city government.
              Take the city of Seymour, in his county, for instance. They have a bank there with a
              capital of $50,000, some of the shares being owned by men who do not live in the city,
              and have no interest in it beyond their snares in the bank. They have simply invested
              their means in an institution for the accommodation of the people of Seymour. Is it
              fair to tax them to maintain the city government, the fire and police departments and
              all the municipal officers? He thought not.</p>
            <p>Mr. NEFF. Suppose a man living in this city owns a thousand head of cattle in Jackson
              county - is he not taxed on them there?</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. The personal property follows the person, and is taxed where he
              resides.</p>
            <p>Mr. FULLER. Suppose a merchant has a store in Indianapolis, and lives outside of the
              corporate limitswhere is that property taxed ?</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. Where he lives, of course.</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Lawrence. Suppose all the merchants of Indianapolis should conclude
              to reside without the corporate limits.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. They ought to be taxed on all their personal property where they reside. I
              am like the boy who said the horse was seventeen feet high - I stick to it.
              [Laughter.] The 69th section of the act provides that the tax shall be a lien on the
              shares of stock. The 70th section provides that nothing in this act shall be so
              construed as to exempt from taxation for municipal purposes the shares of capital
              stock of any bank or banking association organized the laws of this State or the
              United but that all such shares may be assessed for local purposes at the same rate as
              other property. Mr. Brown held that the act passed at the special session contains
              every thing was in the bill. But, since there were some doubtful questions involved,
              he moved that the bills and the two reports be referred to the <orgName>Committee on
                the Judiciary</orgName>, to investigate and report whether any further legislation
              is needed on this subject.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS thought the substitute bill of the majority of the Committee should
              become a law. The only difference between Senators seemed to be whether the stock
              should be taxed in the city where the bank is situated, or where the stockholder
              resides. The only argument in favor of the former proposition is that the city
              furnishes the gas, the fire department and the police to protect the property. If he
              came to this city and loaned a thousand dollars, and took a mortgage on a house in
              this city, the mortgage was not taxed. But it is proposed if a mancomes here and
              invests a thousand dollars in bank stock, to tax his share. He did not see any reason
              for the distinction.</p>
            <p>Mr. FULLER. Suppose a gentleman living in the country has taken stock in a
              manufacturing establishment in the city of Indianapolis, is not he in business here,
              and is not that business taxed? </p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. Yes, sir.</p>
            <pb n="333" xml:id="VAA8558-14-333"/>
            <p>Mr. FULLER. Well, is not it the same with a bank?</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. No, sir, I don't take it as a parallel case.</p>
            <p>Mr. D. was in favor of taxing stockholders where they reside, if they live in the
              State. If not, they must be taxed in the city where the bank is located. The Senator
              from Dearborn [Mr. Gregg] complained that by the law passed at the last session
              authorizing the levying of taxes for school purposes, this bank stock was not taxed,
              and the schools were losing that tax. Now, if $350,000 of that bank stock is owned by
              gentlemen living outside of the city, and that stock is taxed for school purposes at
              all, it should be taxed to support the schools where these gentlemen reside, to
              educate their children, and not the children of Indianapolis.</p>
            <p>Mr. NEFF. What will you do with section 62 of the present revenue law? That provides
              for the taxation of bonds in cities where they are located.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. It provides that they shall be taxed for State, county and township
              purposes, not for municipal. The 70th section provides that the stock shall not be
              exempt from taxation for municpal purposes.</p>
            <p>Mr. NEFF. Take the two sections together.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. If they can be taxedfor municipal purposes under this law, as he
              believed they could, they should be taxed in the cities where the stockholders reside,
              and not where the bank is located.</p>
            <p>Mr. CHAPMAN. Suppose there is a bank in this city with a capital stock of $700,000,
              half owned by a resident of the city and the other half by a man who lives just
              outside the corporate limits. Would it be fair to tax the shares of the former and
              exempt that of the latter?</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. It is very easy to putextreme cases, and I will answer by putting
              another. Is it right that a man living at a distance from here should pay a school tax
              for the benefit of the children of a man who lives in Indianapolis? No law operates
              with equal and exact justice upon all persons. The best we can do is to make the laws
              apply equally to the greatest possible number.</p>
            <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM. The revised law enacted by Congress on the subject of National
              Banks, contains two restrictions, that they shall not pay taxes at any larger rate
              than the bank capital held by private citizens. Now in the city of Laporte there was a
              bank chartered by the State, with a capital of $200,000 and deposits amounting to
              $400,000. That bank is doing a large business, three times what the National Bank is
              doing. He asked whether National Bank could be taxed when the State Bank was exempted.
              He did not think it would be equitable or legal to tax a National Bank, and exempt
              under a State law, the Bank of the State of Indiana.</p>
            <p>Mr. GREGG. The law of Congress as it now is, provides that we shall not tax the stock
              of National Banks at a greater rate than is levied on monied capital belonging to
              individuals residing in the State. It don't tax the notes of banks at all.</p>
            <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM. It seems to me the bill is in clear violation of the law of
              Congress; and with that understanding I shall vote for the motion of the Senator from
              Jackson [Mr. Brown] to refer the bill to the <orgName>Judiciary
              Committee</orgName>.</p>
            <p>The Senate here took a recess till 2 o'clock.</p>

          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
            <p>The Senate met pursuant to adjournment, and the consideration of Mr. Gregg's bill to
              tax banks, was resumed.</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH said he was in favor of the object sought to be effected by the bill, but
              did not think any further legislation was necessary. He believed the object was fully
              covered by the act passed at the last special session. Banks were artificial persons
              and might be taxed wherever located, without violation of the law requiring persons to
              be taxed where they reside. Any man who becomes a part of a banking corporation by
              investing his money in it, divests himself to the extent of his investments, of his
              right to claim to be taxed where he resides, and transfer his liability to taxation to
              the city where the bank is located. Every tax payer in the State has a right to retain
              his personal property under his own control, or, if more profitable, to make himself
              amenable to the laws of an artificial person by taking stock in some manufacturing or
              other kind of a company; and when he does that it is not his personal property any
              longer, but the property of this artificial person of which he has become a part. That
              part of his property necessary to give him an interest in that company is liable to be
              taxed where that artificial person is. The 12th section of the act passed at the
              special session of 1872 provides that where the capital stock is taxed as a whole, the
              individual shares are not taxable. Sections 62 and 70 provide that where the capital
              stock is not taxed the shares may be, and that for all purposes, municipal as well
              State, county, and township. He believed these provisions covered the whole ground,
              but favored the reference of the subject to the <orgName>Committee on
                Judiciary</orgName>.</p>
            <p>Mr. NEFF. Does section 70 confer the power to tax bank stock or shares for municipal
              purposes?</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH. I think it does.</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Lawrence, said if there were doubts whether the shares could <pb
                n="34" xml:id="VAA8558-14-334"/> be taxed under the act of 1872, there was the more
              reason for passing this bill as soon as possible, and not delay it by referring it to
              a committee.</p>
            <p>Mr. FULLER moved to lay Mr. Brown's motion to refer the matter to the
                <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName> upon the table.</p>
            <p>This motion was agreed to.</p>
            <p>The question then recurred on concurring in the minority report.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN said he had not found a Senator who understood this question. He believed
              the bill of last session commonly known as the Shoemaker bill conferred the power to
              tax the shares of National Banks as fully and completely as any legislation can do. If
              there is any doubt about it, that is one of the highest reasons why the bill should be
              considered by some committee, and he moved to refer it to the <orgName>Committee on
                Corporations</orgName>.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT said there were grave difficulties surrounding the question. If any one
              would examine the law of 1872 he would have serious doubts whether all laws providing
              for municipal taxation had not been repealed or so impaired as to require
              re-enactment, and if an assessment law for municipal purposes has to be enacted he
              could not see why the whole thing should not be put together. Why we should single out
              one item of property and provide for its taxation and allow the whole of the balance
              go by, he could not conceive. He did not see why laws should be passed to provide
              specially for the taxation of banks more than a farmer's horses or any other personal
              property. He thought it would be best to revise all the laws in reference to the
              assessment of municipal taxes, to apply to all property not exempt by law, and not
              single out one kind off property. If we revise the law for the assessment of municipal
              taxes and make it correspond to the changes already made we are doing all that is
              necessary. All property naturally and by law and the Constitution is subject to
              taxation and can only be relieved by statute exempting it.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE said it was beyond question that the revenue law of 1872 leaves the power
              to tax all property, bank stock as well as other, where it was before. It was
              necessary, however, that we should have a law prescribing the manner in which the
              assessment shall be made. We had a law on that subject, but in his opinion that law
              was repealed by the act of 1872, and now we had no law for taxing such property for
              municipal purposes. At all events, it is left sufficiently doubtful to require a
              revision of the legislation on the whole subject. That being the case, there was no
              present necessity for the passage of either the original bill, No. 4, or the
              substitute. It would be better to send the bill to some committee and let the subject
              be fully investigated, and let the committee do all that is necessary to do in regard
              to the assessment and collection of municipal taxes.</p>
            <p>Mr. GREGG said a reference to a committee would kill the bill. Able attorneys had
              declared that the act of 1872 did not authorize o assessment of bank stock by city
              authorities. It conferred the power to levy taxes upon it for State, county and
              township purposes, but not for municipal purposes, and such authority ought to be
              given in clear and unmistakable terms. Such a provision is contained in the original.
              There are none of the provisions of the act of 1867 authorizing cities to levy taxes
              in conflict with any of the provisions of this bill. I am informed by a Senator [Mr.
              Neff,] that this bill was drawn by an able lawyer [Governor Baker.] I think the
              country demands its passage, and I think we will be held responsible if we don't pass
              it.</p>
            <p>Mr. ORR. I have come to the same conclusion as the honorable Senator from Jackson
              (Mr. Brown,] that there are but few Senators who understand this bill. I do not
              understand it myself. If the motion to refer would tend to kill the bill, I would
              oppose it, but believing otherwise, I am in favor of its going to some committee so
              that we all may have a chance to understand it fairly and squarely. I cannot see why
              shares of bank stock should not be taxed for municipal purposes as well as other
              property.</p>
            <p>Mr. BOONE. It occurs to me the bill passed last session applies solely to State and
              county taxes, and has no application whatever to the levy or assessment of municipal
              taxes. They have different assessors and a different time for returning the
              assessments, and therefore it could not have been the intention of the Legislature
              that this should apply and be substituted in lieu of the city laws with reference to
              the assessment of taxes. The gentleman from Delaware [Mr. Orr,] seems anxious for the
              reference of the bill to some committee. I would rather take a square vote upon the
              proposition now.</p>
            <p>Mr. GOODING. It seems to me that we have had discussion enough to develope the fact
              that we would be voting in the dark if a vote were taken now upon this bill. I think,
              considering the vast importance of this question, and the intricacy of it, that it
              ought to be referred to a committee. I regret that this Senate voted down the motion
              to refer to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, but an the next best is the
              Committee on Corporations, I think the pending motion ought to carry. After a
              committee has considered the bill we will be all the better prepared to vote upon it.
              I am in favor of a bill to effect the object purposed by this one. The <pb n="335"
                xml:id="VAA8558-14-335"/> city of Evansville is probably more deeply interested in
              it than any other city in the State except Indianapolis. But I am not satisfied, and I
              know many other Senators are not, that this bill is in exactly the properform. I
              therefore favor its reference to a committee in order that it may be perfected and
              presented in such a shape that Senators would have the confidence to vote for it. I
              think the friends of the bill ought to be willing to its reference, with instructions
              if they please. If the gentleman from Jackson [Mr. Brown,] will withdraw his motion, I
              will move to reconsider the vote by which the motion to refer to the
                <orgName>Committee on Judiciary</orgName> was lost.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. I will do so.</p>
            <p>Mr. GOODING. I now move to reconsider the vote by which the motion to refer the bill
              to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> was rejected.</p>
            <p>Mr. GLESSNER. This bill has been referred to the <orgName>Committee on
                Banks</orgName> and reported on. The two political parties of the State of Indiana
              in every single campaign since the establishment of National Banks, I believe, have
              promised their constituents that they would favor the adoption of this law, as it has
              been complained that every species of property within the limits of a corporation has
              to bear its burden of taxation except shares in banks, and my judgment is that we are
              just as well prepared to vote upon this bill now as we will be at any time in the
              future. I desire the friends of this bill to consider this one fact, that at each
              session of the General Assembly that has past where this bill has been considered, it
              has been defeated almost universally by reference. In fact a reference is equivalent
              almost to defeating the measure; and while I do not impugn the motives of any Senator
              who may desire to refer the bill to a committee, I will venture to say that in nine
              cases out of ten he is against the bill. Therefore I say to the friends of this bill
              that they ought not to allow it to go to a committee. I am opposed to this second
              reference. I believe in justice to ourselves and our constituents we ought to take
              this bill up at once and pass it.</p>
            <p>Mr. GOODING. I perhaps have as much interest in the passage of this bill as any
              Senator, except the Senators from Marion county, and it is because I am in favor of
              the principles of the bill, and desire to have it passed in a shape that will effect
              its object, that I want the bill refered to the Judiciary Committee. I am not prepared
              te vote for the bill until satisfied that it will accomplish the object for which it
              is intended. I think that shares of bank stock ought to be taxed for municipal
              purposes, and I want to vote for a bill that will accomplish that. If you force this
              bill to a vote now many Senators are compelled to admit that they don't understand its
              provisions and it is safest for them to vote against it. For the friends of his bill I
              insist that it shall have a hearing before the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>
              and be reported back at an early day. I believe the author of the bill himself is on
              that Committee.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. The basis of the assessment of taxes in cities are the acts of 1858, and
              the acts supplemental thereto. Now by the law we passed last session these laws are
              all repealed.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. I think the Senators from Vigo [Mr. Scott,] and Grant [Mr. Steele,] are
              laboring under a mistake. The law we passed last session cannot effect the municipal
              laws. I understand the law we passed provides "for a uniform assessment of property
              and for the collection and return of taxes thereon." And I find the 21st section of
              the Constitution, Article 4, says: "No act shall ever be revised or amended by mere
              reference to its title, but the act revised or section amended, shall be set forth and
              published at full length." Now you have not even referred to it by title.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. Do I understand that we may repeal parts of a law with reference to State
              and county taxes, and leave all in regard to cities?</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. Certainly.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. I do not understand it so.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. Why is it they single out the single item of banks? Simply because
              heretofore National Banks have not been taxed and it would require a special act for
              the purpose. I cannot see how this act of the special session interferes with
              that.</p>
            <p>Mr. GOODING'S motion prevailed, and the motion to refer the whole subject to the
                <orgName>Committee on Judiciary</orgName> was carried by the following vote:</p>

                Mr. Orr's bill [S. 117] for amendment of the divorce law, was again taken up, and

              <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
              <p>Mr. BROWN, in explanation of his vote said: I am in favor of laying the amendment
                on the table, and shall so vote for this reason: while I believe in allowing parties
                to testify as a general rule, I think it against public policy to allow parties to a
                divorce suit to testify. I am opposed to indefinitely postponing the subject matter,
                and I hope a good and proper revision of the Divorce Law may be had so that the
                seventh clause or seventh section may be stricken out.</p>
              <p>Mr. DWIGGINS, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: I am
                opposed to this amendment for one good reason: If we adopt it without a proviso it
                will allow the party who brings the suit for divorce to swear to a sufficient number
                of facts so that the court would be bound to grant a divorce. These instructions are
                imperative. Are we ready to enact a law under which one person may go into court, in
                the absence of the other and file a petition and swear a case through? I am not. I
                vote "aye."</p>
              <p>Mr. GLESSNER, in explanation of his vote said: I am in favor of adopting that
                amendment for this reason: I have had some little experience in these matters, and
                especially as to the testimony of witnesses, in these cases. All lawyers know that
                some visi prius courts, have always decided that even parties to divorce cases may
                be permitted to testify under the present law, and that question has been appealed
                to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court has been divided on this questiontwo
                judges deciding that parties were competent to testify. And I know in my own
                experience cases where if parties had been permitted to testify the courts trying
                the cases would have been in a better condition to determine the merits of the cases
                than the way the present law is. My impression is that such a measure would defeat
                one half the divorce cases brought in Indiana. My judgment is it would be a good law
                and therefore I vote "no" on this motion to lay on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. GOODING, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said : I think
                parties to such suits would be tempted under the excitement of the case to commit
                perjury. Trials of divorce cases develope a sufficient amount of disgusting evidence
                without the parties coming in and revealing things that ought to be screened from
                the public gaze. And I am opposed to the amendment for another reason : If we adopt
                it instead of restricting the Divorce Law we enlarge it. It would open flood gates
                to fraud and would attach odium to the Divorce Law not now attached to it, for a
                non-resident might come from a foreign State and after being here only six months
                swear to a residence in the State of one year and swear to facts necessary to get a
                divorce. As it is now a party who comes here to get a divorce must find witnesses to
                prove the necessary facts. I vote to lay the amendment an the table. I vote
                "aye."</p>
              <p>Mr. HOUGH, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: I am opposed
                to parties to a suit testifying in any case unless it be a criminal case. As far as
                my experience goes, and I have been practicing ever since the law was enacted
                authorising parties to civil actions to testify, it has done more to demoralize
                society than any law enacted within my recollection. Where only a few dollars and
                cents are involved neighbors go out of court with the impression that one or the
                other has perjured himself for a few dollars. I am opposed to extending such a law,
                and would rather vote for its repeal. I vote "aye."</p>
              <p>Mr. ORR, when his name was called, said: A word in explanation of my vote. When it
                is admitted by all who have spoken in the Senate Chamber, that the statute has cast
                odium upon our State, I look upon this amendment as tending to cast additional odium
                on us. Under the statute, as it now stands, a man may get out of humor with his
                lady, in Massachusetts, come to Indiana, be here one year, go into court under this
                amendment, and swear his case through. Such parties who go into court with their
                minds highly excited, as my friend from Vanderburgh [Mr. Gooding,] says, are likely
                to commit purjury. I vote "aye."</p>
              <pb n="337" xml:id="VAA8558-14-337"/>
              <p>The vote was then announced as above recorded.</p>
              <p>So the amendment was laid on the table.</p>

              <p>Mr. STEELE from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, reported back Mr.
                Dwiggins' bill [S. 110,] to repeal section 18, and amend section 24 of the act
                regulating descents, &amp;c., with a recommendation that it lie on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. DAGGY from the same committee, presented a minority report, recommending, the
                passage of the bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. D. stated the object of the bill was to strike down the law allowing the widow
                only a life interest in the real estate of her deceased husband. Then the bill
                leaves off the proviso "If a man marry a subsequent time," &amp;c. He thought the
                wife was entitled to one-third of her husbands' real estate - not dependent upon
                whether or not she marries a second husband. He favored enlarging the rights of
                married women; and although in conflict with a majority of the Committee, desired
                the Senate to take action upon the question as brought up by the minority
                report.</p>
              <p>Section 24, as proposed to be amended, would read as follows: If a man die
                intestate, leaving a widow and child or children, not exceeding two, the personal
                property of such intestate shall be equally divided among the widow and children,
                the widow taking an equal share with one child; if the number of children exceeds
                two, the widow's share shall not be reduced below one-third of the whole. The object
                of the bill is to secure to the widow, in case of her subsequent marriage, something
                more than a life interest in the property of her first husband, and to make it her
                seperate estate.</p>
              <p>Mr. STEELE combatted the minority report. In cases where there is any considerable
                amount of property at stake, the widow generally soon looses control of what would
                have kept her in good circumstances during old age. He knew not why this was the
                case and yet it is. At least one-third of all the widows and widowers married in the
                country are divorced, and can it be that it was only the money one or the other
                possessed that brought them together? The law provides that the widow shall not
                convey the realty if she marries a second time, and it is because the marriage
                contract is, as a general rule, made without due consideration on the part of the
                widow, and then soon after the property left by the former husband is swept away.
                The present law he thought a wholesome one, and opposed its disturbance, giving
                reasons that moved the majority of the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>
                to report unfavorably on the bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. S. was opposed to the bill. He thought the provisions of the present law were
                necessary to protect the property of the widow from being squandered by some
                spendthrift who might marry her. The bill proposed would only offer a premium to
                those infernal scoundrels who are seeking property by such marriages as these.</p>
              <p>Mr. NEFF. While willing to admit that there may be hardships on both sides I am in
                favor of the minority report. I am in favor of such a modification of the 18th
                section of the present act that a woman might sell the real estate which she may
                have inherited from her deceased husband and dispose of the proceeds as she may
                think best. I believe the real estate the law gives to her should be hers
                absolutely. I introduced a bill at the beginning of the special session, to amend
                section 18 of the present law, so as to give her the right to sell with the consent
                of her husband any real estate she may have inherited from a previous husband, and
                loan or re-invest the proceeds. There are a great many hardships in some cases where
                a woman marries a second or a subsequent time ; for instance where a husband has
                left her a large quantity of uncultivated lands, on which the second husband is
                compelled to pay taxes. In reference to the 24th section I am in favor of the law as
                it now stands.</p>
              <p>Mr. GLESSNER thought the restrictions imposed by the statute were just and
                aquitable and necessary to the protection of widows, who may marry the second time,
                and her children by her first husband, from these sharks who have reduced marriage
                to a fine art, and are continually going about seeking out rich widows.</p>
              <p>Mr. HARNEY. I am satisfied there is no law in reference to descents, more favorable
                in its effects than the statute proposed to be amended. In my opinion, the
                provisions of the present law has saved more women from poverty than any other
                provision on the statute book. If she desires the property to become her's
                absolutely, all she has to do is to alienate the property before her second or
                subsequent marriage, and she can then dispose of the proceeds as she pleases. But in
                most cases they do not do that. Another reason why I should not favor a repeal of
                the section is that this statute gives such general satisfaction among men that they
                are willing to let their property take the course of the law. If this repealing act
                is passed almost every man will make his will. I hope the minority report will not
                be concurred in.</p>
              <p>Mr. BROWN said if a woman marries a widower and has no children by him, she akes
                only a life interest in his estate on his22 <pb n="338" xml:id="VAA8558-14-338"/>
                death. If she has children by him, she takes a fee. Suppose she has no children, and
                he dies, and she inherits one-third of his estate in fee, what becomes of it on her
                death? It goes to her family; to people who are connected by no ties of blood with
                him by whose toil the property was accumulated. The doctrine of descents has been
                carefully considered by the courts, and is pretty well settled, and it seemed to him
                that it would be the hight of folly to dispute it now.</p>
              <p>Mr. DAGGY. I am astonished at the position Senators take. In legistating we are to
                legislate upon general propositions, and not upon exceptional cases. The Senator
                from Grant [Mr. Steele,] and the Senator from Jackson [Mr. Brown,] alluded to
                exceptional cases. You can pass no law but what will work hardships occasionally.
                The changes in the law that I wish to make are wholesome. The objections to the bill
                are first, that the woman has no right to the property that is made by the joint
                labor of herself and husband, that it is all his earnings, and he has a right to lay
                his hand on it and say "this is mine and you have no interest in it." I say the
                accumulations of the marriage relations belong as much to the wife as to the
                husband. Therefore when the husband shuffles off his mortal coil, it is not too much
                to say to her, "You have helped accumulate this property; one-third of it is yours
                to do what you please with." Again,Senators were treating married women as if they
                were fools and idiots,- as if every fool who came along could hoax and deceive them
                in regard to their property. These cases are exceptional. A majority of the women
                are competent to take care of their property and the interests of their children. I
                take it for granted that a man who has sense enough to accumulate property will not
                marry improvidently a woman who has not the sense to take care of it. Men sometimes
                marry women who have property. If she dies the husband takes one-third of her
                property absolutely, and she can't prevent it even by will. He has absolute and
                unqualified control of it, and it descends to his heirs and not to her'sit leaves
                the descent of her blood and goes to his blood. This discrimination in favor of the
                husband was unfair and unjust, a bit of petty tyranny. Ain't it right that a man's
                surviving partner should have one-third of his property so that she may do with it
                as she pleases? - the property she has helped to accumulate? Am I asking too much
                when I say give that to her? I believe I will submit the question without further
                argument. I think it would be placing women in the proper position to repeal that
                section.</p>
              <p>Mr. BROWN moved to lay the minority report on the table, which was carried, and the
                majority report was then concurred in. So the bill was indefinitely postponed.</p>

              <p>Mr. WALKER, from the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName> reported back,
                with the recommendation that it pass, Senate Bill 159, to provide for the submission
                to the qualified electors of the State, for their ratification or rejection, a
                proposed amendment to the Constitution of Indiana in relation to the debt charged
                against the Wabash and Erie Canal with an amendment changing the date of the
                election from the 28th day of January to the 18th day of February.</p>
              <p>He recited the origin and history of the bill, and stated one of the objects to be
                to get the subject out of the hands of the Legislature, in order that there may be
                opportunity to propose other needed constitutional amendments - referring
                particularly to the Governor's recommendation for the submission to the people next
                October, the question of calling a Constitutional Convention.</p>
              <p>Mr. WOOLLEN also stated the necessity of an early submission of this question about

              <p>Mr. BRANHAM asked if there were not certain other bills which were made the special

              <p>Mr. KING said there were serious defects in the bill, and the committee desired

              <p>Mr. SHIRLEY, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned Mr. Willson
                of Ripley's bill [H. R. 276] to prohibit the several courts and county boards in
                this State from making any allowance to county officers for stationary, and
                providing that such officers shall furnish their own stationary, recommending that
                the same be laid on the table.</p>
              <p>Mr. WILLSON of Ripley. In this bill I provide that the courts and county
                commissioners shall not hereafter make any allowance to county officers for
                stationary; except for the record books, and I desire to point out some of the
                abuses under the present system. And as we are called upon by the people to cut down
                all abuses, it seems to me that we have a golden opportunity which we ought not to
                let pass. The State is now paying no less than $300,000 a year for stationary for
                the county officers, when in contemplation of law, this should be paid by the county
                officers themselves; and they put in under the head of stationary four-fifths of all
                the items of supply for their offices. Wherever we find such an abuse of power, we
                ought to put our hand on it. Let gentlemen go to their county offices and to the
                records, and under the head of expenses for stationery they will find pens,
                inkstands, gold pens, erasers, cork-screws and other like things that can not
                properly come under the head of stationary, such as pocket-knives, memorandum books
                etc. And this is carried on to such an extent that they even get from the traders a
                bonus per cent. on their purchases. The County Clerk gets fifty cents for his
                summons, which he procures at the State's expense; whence he gets not only enough
                for himself but all his friends. Besides when he retires from his office he takes
                with him enough of these articles of stationery to last him through the term of his
                natural life. [Laughter.] And the State of Indiana pays all these bills. Now I say
                sir, that a connty clerk does not use as much stationery as a respectable lawyer ;
                yet we find that throughout the State, county clerks are using more than three
                hundred thousand dollars worth of these articles; and that is an expense sufficient
                to carry on the State government. In my own county this expense is more than
                sufficient to keep the paupers of the county. And if you will notice these county
                officers generally, you will find them living in splendor - you will find the
                proceeds of this stationery in their pockets. It is therefore manifestly to the
                interest of the State to require these county officers to purchase their own
                stationery. To give an instance of how this thing is done by them; it is known that
                the book-sellers are in the habit of allowing hem fifteen per cent, on all their
                purchases; and in that way it is to the interest of the county officers to make
                large purchases; and this per cent. goes into the hands of the county officers. I
                insist therefore that we cannot do a better work - better to save money to the
                people - than right now to put a stop to this great abuse.</p>
              <p>Mr. BARRETT. I am convinced that there ought to be something done in this matter. I
                think this abuse ought to be and can be stopped. I understand that many of the
                county officers make those arrangements indicated by the gentleman from Ripley, no
                that they will sell to the officer at wholesale prices and the officer will charge
                the State the retail prices. I have been told by those who know that this is the
                case; so that the people are paying in some cases perhaps double prices. I
                understand that the county of Marion pays out twelve thousand dollars annually. I
                think therefore that something out to be done about this thing, and that we ought to
                make thorough work of it.</p>
              <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. It seems to me that the report of the committee on the Judiciary ought
                to be concurred in which is to lay this bill on the table. The gentleman from
                Ripley, (Mr. Willson) has given a bold account of the condition of things in his
                county; and if we are to believe him, not only the county officers of Ripley county
                but the Board of Commissioners must be a set of thieves. The idea that a lawyer gets
                a little stationery, including cork-screws and pocket-knives, from the treasury, I
                am inclined to resent it. In my county the stationery is furnished by contract by
                the lowest bidder, but if we require the county officers to furnish their own
                stationery it would deprive them of three-fourths of their emoluments. Why, it is
                stated here that Marion county alone furnishes twelve thousand dollars worth of
                stationery annually. Now suppose four thousand dollars worth of that stationery to
                be used improperly - that would leave eight thousand dollars worth to be used
                legitimately. Now to require the county clerk of Marion county to pay that sum,
                would be to take away his salary. It seems to me, sir, that this bill is an effort
                to deprive the County Commissioners of their discretion in this matter. It seems to
                me that it is proper that the County Commissioners should have this discretion, for
                they are immediately responsible to the people; and where the County Commissioners
                are guilty of this abuse, being immediately responsible to the people, they will be
                swept out of office. However no such abuses are to be found in my county. I cannot
                speak for the county of Ripley; but the gentleman himself has spoken for hia own
                county. All I can say is, that this abuse does not prevail in my county, and the <pb
                  n="341" xml:id="VAA8558-14-341"/> passage of this bill would be to deprive the
                County Commissioners of their proper discretion and control of this matter. The
                gentleman says that over three hundred thousand dollars are annually expended in the
                several counties for stationery. I do not know where he gets his figures, but this
                thing of stationery is for the benefit of the people; and if there are abuses, they
                ought to be corrected. But it is neither safe nor wise to govern the people too
                much. The people of each county must themselves look to their own officials, and it
                seems to me that the people of each county can act for themselves better than we can
                act for them.</p>
              <p>Mr. WALKER. It was not doubted by the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> that
                there will be abuses of this kind; but it was held that they could not be corrected
                here. And perhaps I might say that the gentleman's bill has done its work already.
                It seems to have taken its inspiration from his per diem bill of the last session.
                It is not doubted that this abuse ought to be corrected; and I would suggest it to
                the gentleman as a good way to prevent at least the purchase of cork-screws for
                stationery, to provide a good temperance bill. I think the gentleman had better vote
                for the proposed temperance bill, and then there would be no need of these
                cork-screws. But let us consider the effect of this bill. The gentlemen if he were a
                judge, would have to arm himself with half a quire of paper - with an inkstand in
                his pocket - and a cork-screw, if necessary, if he went to Ripley county to hold
                court. But the gentleman further says that it is not right for the county clerk to
                get fifty cents for the summons he issues, while he gets his printed summons for
                less money. But now every client has the right to write to the county clerk; and it
                is the duty of the clerk to furnish information to him about the status of his case
                - as to whether or not execution has been issued etc. Now for all this the clerk
                would have to buy his own stationery. I do not doubt, sir, and the committee do not
                doubt, that this matter ought to be regulated; but we think the gentleman's bill is
                wrong - that it partakes too much of a principle that is wrong. Suppose a man living
                in an outer township becomes a candidate for one of these offices, and his neighbors
                electioneer for him because he is an honest man - upright in his business
                transactions - but the moment he becomes a candidate "eo instanti" the cry goes out:
                He is a scoundrel. Now this ought not to be so. And this bill partakes of this
                principle, by assuming fraudulent intentions on the part of the judges and county
                officers; and does it not pre-suppose that the County Commissioners cannot regulate
                this matter? The Commissioners do not purchase these things; but they should make
                themselves so far acquainted with the matter as to prevent fraud; and the people
                should hold them to this duty; so that there could be no fraud in the case, unless
                the board were a party to it. All this can be regulated, bnt this sound discretion
                should not be prohibibited.</p>
              <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. The <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName> have recommended
                that this bill lie on the table. There is a bill now before the Senate, it is a fee
                bill - and if that bill should pass I would be in favor of this bill, for in every
                county where they are living under a fee bill there ought to be such a law as this
                bill proposes. So when we shall see what will be done with that Senate bill to
                regulate the fees, then we can understand what should be done with this proposition,
                for if the county officers are to live on their salaries fixed by law, it will be
                hard for them to furnish their own stationery.</p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN called up the special order, being Mr. Neff's bill [No. 36,] to amend the
              bastardy act. The amendment provided that if any person other than the mother, shall
              be appointed trustee of the fund for the maintenance and education of the illegitimate
              child, such person shall give bonds for the faithful performance of his duty, and
              prohibits the dismissal of any bastardy case upon the application of the mother until
              the Court should have been fully advised by a written statement entered of record of
              the promises made for the maintenance and education of the child, and shall be
              satisfied that the settlement is just and sufficient.</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence. I hope this bill will not pass. I do not think this change
              is necessary. I believe the present act is giving satisfaction to the people of the
              State. And I am opposed to this change for the reason that it compels parties to go
              into the courts when they are unwilling to go. When a suit is commenced, however
              desirous the prosecuting witness may be to end the suit, the power is taken away from
              her, and she is scared or driven into court whether willing or not. Now it is not a
              light matter for a prosecuting witness to be compelled to go into court and tell her
              story of sorrow and distress, and misfortune to the public, and my judgment is that
              you would do much to degrade and debase that prosecuting witness by such a course; and
              that the evil will be greater than the good of this act. I am opposed to the principle
              of taking away from the prosecuting witness the right to settle her case whenever she
              sees proper to do so. I do not know why we should discriminate against women thus
              unfortunate and say that they are not able to decide for themselves.</p>
            <p>Mr. O'BRIEN. I understand this bill to provide that the settlements must be made with
              the approval of the Circuit and Common Pleas Courts. An old bench decided that under
              the present law settlements could not be made before justices courts and a subsequent
              bench decided otherwise. The idea of the law is to protect the children themselves and
              make provision to keep them out of the alms house. These settlements are sometimes
              made for twenty-five and sometimes one hundred dollars. Many times these mothers are
              of a weak and feeble mind. Now if they are permitted to settle their matters out of
              court without any rule to govern them the result is that no provision is made for this
              class of citizens. I am of the opinion an amount should be fixed below which no
              settlement should be made. And if the mother is incapable of taking care of the infant
              a guardian should be appointed to take care of the child. I am in favor of this bill
              because I think it is an improvement on the law we now have. I wish it was a greater
              improvement. </p>
            <pb n="343" xml:id="VAA8558-14-343"/>
            <p>Mr. NEFF. I introduced this bill originally, but there has been some amendment made
              to it since. The bill as I introduced it provided for changing the jurisdiction also.
              That part of the bill the committee struck out. As a general proposition these cases
              before Justices of the Peace are perfect farces, and I think they should go out of
              Justices courts. It is not a question as far as the law is concerned, of settlement
              between the putative father and the mother, but between the putative father and the
              people of the State on relation of the mother. If the mother is allowed to defeat the
              operations of the law it throws the child upon the authorities of the county, and this
              bill is as much in the interests of the people of the county, as it is in the interest
              of the mother, that whatever kind of settlement is made shall be a proper one.</p>
            <p>The Senator from Lawrence [Mr. Friedley] objects to this bill on the ground that it
              compels the mothers to go into court. I understand that it does not change the present
              principle of law one iota in that respect. She may settle the whole difficulty without
              even going before a Justice of the Peace. This bill would simply change the power of
              the mother to settle the difficulty after she has once gone into court - after the
              matter has passed from the jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace, without the
              intervention of the court. It is generally an unfortunate class of persons who get
              into these difficulties, and the law ought to throw its protection around the people
              of the State and around the child. I think this bill commends itself to the judgment
              of every Senator. I see no ground for objection to it. It simply proposes to protect
              the mother and the child against the imposition of scoundrels.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN favored the passage of the bill, and especially of the requirement that
              provision shall be made by the father, for not only the maintenance but the education
              of the child. The more stringent we make the law against the father the less likely
              men will be to commit the offense. He would be in favor of making the law penal, to
              teach men that they can not commit this crime against society with impunity.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS would vote to make the offense a crime, but to compel the father to
              provide in advance for the education of the child and if he was unable to do so to
              thrust him into prison he thought was going too far.</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH read the present statute to show that since its enactment the courts have
              been empowered on conviction of the father to compel him to provide both for the
              maintenance and education of the child. There is no lawyer but sees the propriety of
              requiring by law that whenever a compromise has been effected it should be made the
              duty of the court to take control of that compromise and see that such provisions for
              the maintenance of the child are made as is contemplated by the statute. The
              obligation to educate and maintain a bastard child is just as strong in morals as with
              reference to any other child. The law should be so amended that the father shall not
              escape the obligations that justly rest upon him in consequence of his act. I cannot
              see how any man caring anything about the interests of the State can cast his vote
              against a bill of this character.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE insisted a change was made by the bill in this regard, that, whereas,
              under the existing law, a settlement may be made on the basis of a provision by the
              putative father of the child for the maintenance of the child alone, the bill requires
              that the father must provide, even in a compromise, for both the maintenance and
              education of the child. The provision would work severely against the poor man who,
              unable to provide for the education of the child, would be thrown into prison.</p>
            <p>Mr. SLEETH. I do not apprehend this bill will change the practice materially. In
              every case where a proper compromise has been made under this bill, should it become a
              law, the courts will approve it; but where a weak-minded girl is imposed upon and
              makes an improvident contract, the court will set it aside as he ought to. So this
              bill would not prevent a compromise in any case where it ought to be carried out. A
              young woman who has fallen into the unfortunate condition contemplated in the bill, is
              usually deserted by her friends, and is peculiarly subject to the influence of the
              father of the children. Unless, therefore, the Court is empowered to guard her
              interests, she is likely to be deceived and imposed upon. As between these two parties
              the one standing friendless and alone; the other backed by friends and perhaps wealth,
              the courts should see that justice is done. As it is now, all that is required of her
              is to come into court and say that everything has been settled to her satisfaction -
              what that is no one knows except the defendant and herself. I say the provisions of
              this bill which require the terms and conditions of the compromise to be approved by
              the court, are wise and just, and for that reason I propose to support this bill and
              vote for it.</p>
            <p>Mr. GOODING. I think this bill has occupied as much time as the importance demands.
              There is one objection to the bill I should like to have remedied. Some provision
              should be made for the release of men who are imprisoned by reason of inability to <pb
                n="344" xml:id="VAA8558-14-344"/> pay the judgment against them. When a man is put
              in prison because he is not willing to pay what is decreed against him, there is no
              provision made for his getting out, and I do not understand that any means are
              afforded by which he can make money while imprisoned. We ought not to compel Judges of
              courts to resort to subterfuges to avoid the law. I think that there ought to be an
              amendment to the bill that the time of imprisonment should not exceed one year,
              provided however, that such release shall not operate to extinguish the debt. If the
              Senate will allow such an amendment I will vote for the bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. DITTEMORE objected and the amendment was not introduced.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. Is it better to allow the parties to compromise and let the woman take
              what she can secure, or is it better to take the course proposed in the bill and have
              the whole matter spread upon the records of the court for the inspection of the
              present and future generations? Then, if the matter is compromised perhaps it can be
              done without much cost, but go into court and the first money made for the unfortunate
              woman, where does it go to? To the child? No, sir, the court fees must be paid, and
              the attorneys fees must be paid. I think the law is good enough as it is.</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence. Under this bill, should it become a law, the moment a woman
              puts her name to an affidavit charging any person with being the father of her bastard
              child she is then in the hands of the court. I need not call the attention of the
              attorneys to the character of trials of this class. Every Senator knows that whenever
              one of these cases comes up for trial we always find the court-room filled; and do
              gentlemen believe that the cause of humanity demands that such disgusting details
              shall be made public before these large audiences. And how is the court to determine
              what amount of money should be paid unless he hears the case? The defendant don't
              confer when he is compelled to go into court, what good would a confession do him?.
              Mr. F. contended that the bill would operate against the cause of humanity, morality
              and Christianity. When he had concluded - </p>
            <p>Mr. HAWORTH demanded the previous question.</p>
            <p>The Senate seconded the demand and under the operations of the previous question the
              bill failed to pass - yeas 21, nays 21 for want of the constitutional majority of 26
              votes. [See middle of second column page 63.]</p>
            <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
            <p>Mr. ORR, when his name was called said: In explanation of my vote I wish to say that
              as I understand this bill it prevents an improper compromise being made between a
              woman and her base seducer - it gives the court the power to annul such a compromise.
              I think this bill makes that matter clear, and with this conviction, I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>So the bill failed.</p>

            <p>The SPEAKER recurred to the unfinished business of yesterday, viz: Mr. Willson of
              Ripley's bill [H. R. 276] for an act prohibiting the courts and County Commissioners
              of the State, from making any allowances to county offices for stationery and
              providing that such offices shall furnish their own stationery - the question being on
              concurrence in the reports of the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>
              recommending that this bill be laid on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLSON of Ripley. I desire to notice some of the objections to the bill which
              were offered yesterday. It will be remembered that I said yesterday that the several
              county officers consumed over $300,000 worth of stationery annually, which the law
              contemplates that they shall furnish for themselves ; and that certain members
              objected to that statement, because as they alleged, that the courts would not be
              furnished with stationery. That is a mistake, there is nothing in the law to prevent
              the courts from ordering stationery for their own use, if we prohibit stationery for
              the county offices. It is insisted also, that this bill will be a hardship on the
              county officers, because they have to answer many letters, etc., but I insist this
              would be a very small item of expense to them ; and I say now again, that any
              respectable Attorney, in his ordinary business, uses more stationery than any county
              officer. It has been the policy of our Legislature ever since we have had a
              Legislature to shut the door against all abuses in the public offices; therefore I
              insist that we ought to pass this bill. I am surprised to see gentlemen come up here
              overflowing with sympathy for the county officers, whom they have felt so free to
              censure on other occasions; and when they know that the General Assembly have so long
              tried to control and regulate the abuses in these offices; when they know that these
              officers have filed constructive fees, till it has become even hazardous for a man to
              go into the courts. Now sir, this bill presents an opportunity by which we can prevent
              these abuses, for it is notorious that where these offices use one dollars worth of
              stationery for themselves, they purchase ten dollars worth for their friends, at the
              public expense. Our statutes against fraud aud perjury proceed upon the same theory.
              There is no reason in equity or morals, why a man should be responsible for anything
              not in writing; and it is to prevent this, that the statutes against fraud and perjury
              are enacted. This question has been discussed ; and if there is any gentleman here
              afraid of the question, assuming that It <pb n="346" xml:id="VAA8558-14-346"/> should
              not be discussed on account of the purity of the county officers, then I say he should
              contemplate himself, and the action of the House as to its own members. I say it is a
              little strange to see those who raised their voices against this bill yesterday, and
              remember that they were not afraid of the principle when they themselves were to be
              affected by it. I love my profession, and I love any man who loves his profession. The
              gentleman from Gibson [Mr. Buskirk,] wants to know what kind of people we have for
              county officers in Ripley county. I speak for our County Clerk and our Commissioners,
              that they would not take a pen nor a pencil that did not belong to them, any sooner
              than the virtuous officers of his county, of whom he says they would not do such
              things ; and he assumes that because they would not do such things we ought not to
              provide against their doing them. But now Mr. Speaker, it was one of the very first
              lessons of my life not to put too much confidence in a man who talks about his own
              honesty. [Laughter.] The people of his county may be very respectable people. From
              what I have learned of them, I respect them very highly : and certainly I am fortified
              in that sentiment by my contact and acquaintance with the honorable gentleman himself.
              My friend from Gibson inquires what we should do with those people in Ripley county?
              Well, I will venture to say that the people of Ripley county are a somewhat refined
              people. They have kept pace with the progress of the age; but as for Gibson, where
              they have not kept up with the times, they are in the dark yet, and they regard it as
              a joke, when we would take away a job from a Clerk ; but down in our county we use the
              pretty wedding cards with royal signets. It is stated by the gentleman from Gibson
              that I have moved this bill as a joke; but I am in earnest in this matter. I see these
              abuses in the county offices; and I see the load of taxes under which the people are
              groaning, and I see the opportunity to lift from them by this bill no less than
              $300,000 of their taxes. I insist that we should not be controlled in this niatter by
              our sympathies for our County Clerks, Recorders, Treasurers and Sheriffs. We should
              speak here for the whole people, and lift from their shoulders these burdens as we may
              be able. I am opposed to all perquisites in office. It is these that are eating out
              the heart's blood of our people; and we ought to put a stop to them. It is not the
              fees that we pay to our officers, but it is what they take as perquisites that I am
              aiming at. Now then, I am satisfied that the passage of this bill would not work
              injustice to any one. But my friend from Gibson says it will take away three-fourths
              of the emoluments of the office. Well now if they get three-fourths of their pay from
              their stationery in Gibson county what kind of men must they have down there? As for
              me I have but one expression from my people, and that is to pass this bill; and I am
              satisfied that our duty lies in that direction.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY alleged that in nearly every county the officers are acting under the old
              fee bill; and he said: if you pass this bill it will apply to the County Auditors and
              County Treasurers, who are governed by the salary bill. It should be so shaped as to
              apply to the Clerks and Sheriffs also. I am willing to go with the gentleman [Mr.
              Willson,] for any proposition to protect the people, but he must not put it in such a
              shape as this. He seeks to make a discrimination between the county officers, which I
              do not like. The Auditors and Treasurers of the counties are now provided with
              stationary under the Fee and Salary Bill; and as it is now with all the offices of my
              county, the passage of this bill would not affect us. But what we want is, that the
              Legislature shall declare by law, that the Clerks and Sheriffs shall be bound by the
              salary bill. What I would prefer would be to let the gentleman's bill lie over till we
              may be able to see what the General Assembly will do; and when we can agree on a basis
              of law by which all these offices shall be governed, then I would be willing to
              consider his bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. WALKER. I would not like to get myself this morning in the way of suspecting men
              of dishonesty. I do not believe that mood suggests the best of arguments ; and I
              believe also, that it would not be the most likely to advance his cause for a man to
              draw upon his imagination for his facts - to set up a man of straw in opposition to
              his bill and then adroitly knock it over. I am too modest a man to permit myself to
              say to the House that I do not draw my stationery from the county offices ; I
              certainly made no such allusion. But now, running the risk of incurring the suspicion
              of Old Honesty himself, I will say to the House that I live too far from the county
              seat to draw my stationery from that source. It is hardly argument to say that
              opposition to the gentleman's bill cornea only from those who are interested in this
              way. Does he mean to say, that the gentleman from Gibson [Mr. Buskirk,] and myself are
              interested in this way? if so, I deny it on my part, and I would spurn the allusion. I
              would put myself by the side of the gentleman himself, (upon whose brow is written
              honesty) if he did not live in Ripley county. [ insist that this outcry against the
              dishon-ty of the county officials came alone from his county ; and I would like to
              inquire why it is that his people - such a people - should have the singular
              partiality toward him to send such an honest man to the Legislature? </p>
            <pb n="347" xml:id="VAA8558-14-347"/>
            <p>I would advise them rather to put him into their county offices, and send their count
              yoffices to the Legislature ; and we will reform, as we have already perhaps reformed
              him. [Laughter.] Now, the recommendation of the Committee is that this bill lie on the
              table; and we made this recommendation with the hope and expectation that some
              amendment will be made to the general law by which this matter may be regulated - not
              that this - bill should pass - but that the matter might be regulated by requiring the
              stationery to be procurred of the lowest responsible bidder; that the County
              Commissioners supervize the matter, and allow only such purchases as shall be
              necessary.</p>
            <p>Mr. BUSKIRK, having been sometime ago by the gentleman from Ripley, dubbed as the
              poet of this end of the Capitol, returned the compliment by quoting two caustic
              sentiments from Butler, the poet, and applying them to Mr. Willson's method in debate,
              and his idea of the honesty and integrity of the office holders in Ripley county. The
              gentleman from Ripley, it will be remembered is the author of the per diem bill, by
              which he gives to himself eight dollars a day; and this fact should be taken in
              consideration with the local politics of Ripley county,where there has been
              considerable party warfare, which has not always resulted according to the gentleman's
              wishes,though it so happens that they send an honest man to the Legislature, whilst
              they will strangely persist in electing dishonest men to be their Clerk, and other
              local officers. And now he wishes, by this bill, to deprive his democratic office
              holders at home of part of their profits.I have said of three-fourths of their
              profits;which it would seem need not be abated when we consider the cork-screws; but
              say one-fourth. The gentleman alleged that this county stationery business costs the
              State $300,000 a year. I asked him where he got his statistics; and he did not answer
              that question this morning.</p>
            <p>Now, Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that we ought to regard this matter in the light of
              common sense But by this bill, the County Commissioners would be stript of all
              discretionary power in regard to stationery in their counties. It will be remembered
              by the House, that, under our system of State Government, there is lodged with the
              County Commissioners what might be called quasi legislative and executive powers. This
              is a necessity - founded in the principle, that the people of the several counties can
              best determine for themselves what are the particular and varied wants of the several
              localities. This is a principle - fundamental in our form of government - that the
              States can better determine their own affairs, their own local institutions, than
              those local institutions can be determined by the General Government. We find that
              theory running through our whole governmental system. It is founded in experience
              justified by all the facts of our history within the range of political observation.
              The people of the counties can determine what they want far better than the State
              Legislature. So also, the people of the State of Indiana can legislate far wiser and
              better as to their own State affairs than can the General Government, at Washington.
              And this bill is an innovation upon what we have established in this country as a
              fundamental principle of government. And I say that the Board of County Commissioners
              of Ripley county or Gibson county know better what are the wants and requirements of
              the people of those counties, than can be known by any possible Legislature. Then it
              is better that the Commissioners should have this power lodged with them; and in that
              way it is, that they can be held responsible to the people who elect them, and who can
              wipe them out of office. This bill is an anomally. It does not propose to restrict the
              County Commissioners in any other respect. It proposes to invade their powers in one
              particular only - in the matter of stationery - and leave their powers unimpaired in
              every other particular. Now I ask, why should we restrict them in the matter of
              stationery and leave them unrestricted as to everything else? If they are competent to
              exercise legislative power in their county over every other matter appertaining to the
              Treasury and the people, then there is no reason why they should be robbed of their
              power as to the supply of stationery. As to the abuses which have been dilated upon
              here, they do not exist among my people. I have heard of them for the first time in
              this debate. They do not exist in the county I represent. And so far as the charge is
              concerned, that the members of the Bar are supplying themselves with stationery from
              the county offices, I will say here, that I have been practicing law for six years,
              and in that time I have not taken fifty cents worth of stationery in an unlawful way.
              The stationery is provided for the Court; and during the term the lawyers are in the
              habit of using it just as it is used by the judges and the Court. That is right and
              proper, and it does not amount to very much. And what does this stationery consist of?
              It consists of summonses, subpoenas, legal blanks, and the books of Record, pens,
              blank paper, etc. I do not think there has been made any great scare-crow out of the
              expense for all this in our county. Now it seems to me that there is simply an attempt
              to make capital out of this matter of stationery, when there is no necessity for it.
              If members will look to their own counties, (of course I am begging the question
              here,) they will find, that these <pb n="348" xml:id="VAA8558-14-348"/> alleged abuses
              in the matter of stationery either have no existence at all, or furnish no occasion
              for a bill of this enormous character, which proposes to strip the county of its
              individual, discretionary power, and whereby it is strangely proposed to be declared
              that the countv officers are dishonest in the matter of stationery, while they they
              are honest in every other matter!</p>
            <p>Mr. MILLER. In our county we have but little difficulty about this matter. I do not
              think it amounts to much if a man does come into a county office once in awhile and
              write a letter there. It's no very great evil, even if a lawyer does use a blank
              without paying for the printing, though it is probably without law. I do not think
              there is any authority to make for the Courts an appropriation of this kind. But
              still, I do not feel prepared to vote intelligently on this bill; because where the
              county officers are acting upon the present Fee and Salary bill, this bill won't
              apply. Its effect in all such cases will be to cut down their compensation. I am
              satisfied that part of the law ought to be repealed, and then we might be prepared to
              vote intelligently on this bill.As to the use of legal blanks,the law contemplates
              that the officer shall write the whole thing out. As to the present question, I think
              this bill ought to be laid on the table, till we may know what the Committee on Fees
              and Salaries will do - what they will recommend to the House, As matters stand now I
              think it would be unjust to pass the bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. COBB, thinking we have carried this debate far enough, moved for the previous
              question, - but withheld the motion for -</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLSON, of Ripley. I am afraid that the gentleman from Decatur (Mr. Miller,) and
              the gentleman from Morgan and Johnson (Mr. Shirley,) will kill this bill with
              excessive kindness. It is true, sir, that you will gain nothing by abolishing the
              abuses in regard to stationery and printing, without inquiring first what we are to do
              further? I say, that if this bill is right, it ought to be passed; and then, if there
              remains any defect we may pass a bill to correct it. - My friend from Gibson [Mr.
              Buskirk,] is mistaken about the politics of our county. We are a little mixed there -
              about half-and-half - half Republican and half Democrat. So there is no ground for
              alleging individual spite against me.</p>
            <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. I will ask the gentleman if there has not been a fight there about
              stationery?</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLSON. I never said a word about that. - I move to lay the report of the
              Committee on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. COBB now insisted on the demand for the previous question.</p>
            <p>The SPEAKER. That is not necessary, if the motion be entertained to lay the report on
              the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. COBB. I insist on the demand.</p>
            <p>Mr. CAUTHORN. I rise to a point of order; It is this: That all this debate is out of
              order - the report of the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName> being to lay
              the bill on the table.</p>
            <p>The SPEAKER. That is so.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLSON, of Ripley. I rise to a order: Is it not in order to make a motion to lay
              the report on the table?</p>
            <p>The SPEAKER. It would have been in order for the gentleman to make that motion if the
              gentleman had not obtained the floor by courtesy. But now the gentleman from
              Huntington insists on his demand for previous question.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLSON. Then I demand the yeas and nays on the main question.</p>
            <p>The SPEAKER. The yeas and nays will be taken.</p>
            <p>There was then a second to the demand for the previous question; the main question
              was ordered, and the same being taken, the result was reported - yeas 46, nays 45as
              follows: - see page 66.</p>
            <p>So the report of tire Committee was concurred in, and the bill was laid on the
              table.</p>

            <div type="section">
              <head rend="center">EMPIRICISM.</head>
              <p>The Speaker recurred again to Mr. Hardesty's motion which was filed last Friday to
                reconsider the vote by which the House rejected Mr. Satterwhite's bill [H. R. 101]
                to protect the citizens of the State from empiricism, and elevate the medical
                profession.</p>
              <p>Mr. THAYER. My object in desiring the reconsideration of this vote is because there
                were but seventy-five members present when the bill was rejected ; and I think it is
                entitled to consideration and discussion on its merits, and then if gentlemen should
                think it will not be for the benefit of the people, I shall be willing that it may
                be voted down. But, sir, the people of my region are very anxious for legislation on
                this subject. All the surrounding States have such a law as this bill purposes, and
                the result is that the State of Indiana is filled with quacksthose medical
                adventurers and vampires of the life of the more helpless classes. I have, myself,
                one objection to the bill, and that isit is not sufficiently strong and stringent in
                its provisions ; but I desire to see it placed on the statutes, so that we may have
                a beginning in this line of legislation.</p>
              <p>Mr. BLOCHER. I think we have had this subject up about as often as there is any
                need for its consideration in the House. We have had it up twice, and twice it has
                been voted down ; and I think the grounds upon which it was voted down were well
                taken <pb n="349" xml:id="VAA8558-14-349"/> Mr. Speaker, I say, woe be unto the
                people when such a law as this bill proposes shall be foisted upon them. I for one
                want to have my choice of the man who is to administer the dose of medicine that I
                must take. But, sir, the passage of this bill would drive this question right into
                politics. In my county we have a democratic party; and they would be likely to
                select my supplanter to dose me; and I say, sir, that every poor man ought to have
                the right which I have stated, if he is so poor that he can't own the stick to stir
                his mush. My county, sir, don't desire any such law; and I insist that my friend
                from Wayne [Mr. Walker,] who has plead so well for his personal rights in such
                cases, should have the right of natural selection as to the employment of his
                mid-wife.</p>
              <p>Mr. THAYER. If the gentleman's argument is good, that Republican and Democratic
                medical examiners would certify physicians of their own politics only, then we are
                already in the same difficulty with regard to the power of our school examiners over
                the teachers of the common schools; in counties having a Republican Examiner, we
                must have Republican teachers, and in counties with a Democratic Examiner, we must
                have Democratic teachers. But, on the contrary, we find that every applicant who has
                the ability to teach, gets the certificates and enjoys the right to do without
                regard being had to his politics. We can only judge of the future by what we know of
                the past; and we may judge pretty well as to what this law will do in the State of
                Indiana, by what it has already done in the State of Ohio. I certainly can have no
                objection to the right assumed by the gentleman from Scott [Mr. Blocher,] and
                others, to employ their own midwives to administer medicine, or poison, as the case
                may be; but I deny the right of those mercenary quacks to prey upon the people. You
                know, sir, that it is often very difficult for a poor man to obtain a good
                Physician. - The poor are the class that are preyed upon by those quacks. I know a
                whole family poisoned by one of them. - But this bill of the gentleman from Morgon
                [Mr. Satterwhite,] is confessedly, not stringent enough; and, if the pending motion
                to reconsider shall prevail, and the bill shall come again before the House, and if
                the gentlemen who have urged this objection shall desire to apply their practical
                amendments, I here give notice of my willingness to assist them.</p>
              <p>Mr. HATCH. I think the gentleman from Scott [Mr. Blocher,] is mistaken as to the
                provisions of this bill. The main features of the bill are these: It requires that
                the legal practictioner shall be either a graduate of some medical school or he
                shall have been in the practice of medicine for ten years, or he shall have a
                practitioner's certificate issued by some medical society. But now, these provisions
                are not sufficiently stringent - not so strong as I would make them. I would require
                three year's study and a diploma. Still, I think this bill might do some good ; and
                if it do nothing further, it will prevent those medical adventurers from traveling
                over the country, and taking large sums of money from the people without doing them
                any good. And we know that there are a large number of these in the State of
                Indiana. - I do not believe that this bill would cut off from practice a single
                resident physician in the State; for there is hardly a practitioner in the State,
                respectable and respected in the profession, who has not been in the practice at
                least ten years.</p>
              <p>Mr. BARRETT. I am in favor of action on this bill. Now sir, you compel every school
                teacher in the country to bear an examination before he shall go into a school and
                teach vour children ; yet members here are unwilling to pass a law by which a man
                who tampers with your health and life, shall show himself to be possessed of any
                qualification whatever. I am certainly not unwilling that the gentleman from Scott
                [Mr. Blocher,] should select his own quack to doctor him, or to kill him ; but I am
                unwilling that such a quack shall be authorized by law to bring in his bill for
                killing him. Now sir, in other States they have such a law as this bill proposes,
                and it drives out the quacks from those States; and I think we ought to have such an
                act in this State, to put a stop to the trade of the quacks ; for if there is
                anything in the world that a man ought to be protected in, it is in the matter of
                his own life ; and the lives of his family and friends. If a man is going to
                practice medicine he should certainly qualify himself for it. But unfortunately in
                this matter of the practice of medicine generally there is more ignorance than in
                any thing else under the sun. You may take nine hundred and ninety-nine out of a
                thousand of the people and they are entirely ignorant in reference to the practice
                of medicine ; they know nothing about diseases and remedies. I cannot see why it is
                that gentlemen should be opposed to some just and legal qualifications for this
                business. A man cannot even practice law without some qualifications - he must have
                a good moral character - while you do not require that the physicians shall have
                even a good character. I can't see why gentlemen should be so sensitive on this
                question. As a vender of drugs myself I make it a rule that I will not fill the
                prescription that is written by a quack.</p>
              <p>Mr. BUSKIRK [interposing.] Does the gentleman say that there is a provision in the
                bill which requires him to so refuse?</p>
              <p>Mr. BARRETT. No, but I do say that <pb n="350" xml:id="VAA8558-14-350"/> there are
                men today, writing prescriptions in the State of Indiana, who do not know what they
                are composed of; and there is not a day in the year but what some one is killed in
                this way. There are men here, perhaps, who know nothing about medicine, and this may
                be quite a new thing to them; but if gentlemen on this floor had studied medicine, I
                am certain that they would not have voted as they have been voting on this question.
                I venture to say that eventually, the General Assembly will be forced to do
                something in this matter. It is a fact even now, that in New York City a man cannot
                even till a prescription without undergoing an examination as to his qualifications
                as a pharmacist; yet here in Indiana it is claimed that every quack shall be
                admitted to the practice. I venture to say that there are not one-fourth of the
                nominal physicians in Indiana who know anything about the composition of drugs. Why
                sir, there are certain medicines that are harmless in themselves, but by their
                combination they would kill a man ; and yet strange to say it, the House does not
                want to require of physicians a legal qualification.</p>
              <p>Mr. MELLETT. In ordinary cases I think the danger is that a man will spend too much
                mony for medicine ; and certainly if he has a physician, he should have a good one ;
                but when there arises a question like this, involving the health and life of the
                people, it is fair to consider whether this right to employ a physician should be
                circumscribed. It may be that a large portion of the practicing physicians of the
                State of Indiana are a curse to society - that they do more harm than good - and I
                wish some of these gentlemen had to live in the border counties on the eastern side
                of the State; for then they would know, that the law which this bill proposes, had
                no sooner been passed by the Legislature of the State of Ohio, than these Medical
                Vampires came over the line into the State of Indiana, and they are now having their
                run with us. It may be true it is true, that in ordinary cases a man should
                determine such a question as the employment of a physician for himself, but this
                often becomes a very difficult as well as a delicate question. - Men are often in a
                condition in which they are incompetent to decide this question intelligently. Their
                health is gone at once. They are on a rapid decline and their judgment and mental
                force declines as well; and thus many an impotent man is thrown upon the mercy of
                these quacks. I say that such a man needs protection ; and one reason for it is that
                the profession of medicine demands it. Assuredly every man who addicts himself to
                the medical profession, and makes himself an honorable and useful member of society
                - is entitled to the stern protection of the law; and this is a strong reason why we
                should consider this question soberly. I say, sir, that the medical profession are
                asking for this protection - they have been asking for it for years - and they
                should have it. Should we doubt that these honest men who adopt the profession to
                cure the ills the flesh is heir to, should have protection from quacks who go about
                trifling with the health and the lives of the people? I think we ought to pay that
                much respect to the profession whose interests are represented in this bill. I adopt
                the same theory in regard to education and educators; and pay the same deference to
                those engaged in that profession - admitting always that they know better what
                should be done in regard to the education of the people than we do. I hope therefore
                that the vote by which this bill failed will be reconsidered and that we may be able
                to act upon it intelligently.</p>
              <p>Mr. BILLINGSLEY. When the vote was taken on this bill the other day, I voted
                against it, because I was not satisfied with its provisions. I ana well satisfied
                however that something should be done in this direction; and I hope therefore that
                that vote will be reconsidered, and that the bill may be amended, and be made
                acceptable to the House. I think the greatest necessity for the bill is in the fact
                that our towns and villages, are filled with pretenders in medicine - pretenders
                even to supernatural powers to heal diseases, and that their occupation of bleeding
                the pockets of the people may be stopped by it.</p>
              <p>Mr. DIAL. I desire to say a few words. I hope the motion to reconsider will not
                carry. There has been a great deal said about quacks, and about licensing
                professional men - that all classes of men in the professions should be licensed.
                Now I am opposed to this ; and I speak from personal knowledge as to the medical
                profession. I know a physician, a man who has been a practicing physician for 45
                years, one of the most successful in my county ; and he never knew anything about a
                sheepskin ; and such I venture to say is the case, with a large majority of the
                physicians of the State ; and I venture to say this further, that in most cases they
                are the impositors who display their sheepskins - that they often impose on the
                people with their sheepskins till they have worn all the skin out of them and
                skinned the people. I am at least able to say so much for the sheepskin men of my
                county. We all know that these sheepskins can be bought with money.</p>
              <p>Mr. RICHARDSON. [interposing.] That is the class of men we would like to get
                at.</p>
              <p>Mr. DIAL [continuing.] You go to the board of medical examiners for your
                certificates under the provisions of this bill, and how easy it would be for that
                board and their <pb n="351" xml:id="VAA8558-14-351"/>\friends to get together and
                say: "Nobody shall be doctors but ourselves." I am free to say that it is a bad
                principle to determine by legislation, or by any arbitary power - as to whom I shall
                employ to administer medicine to me or my family. I say it is right that I should
                have my own choice in the matter; and I am opposed to the bill on the principle of
                inherent right. We have laws for punishing mal-practice in medicine - laws
                inflicting severe penalties - and I am in favor of them. Gentlemen say that all
                professional men must have their commission papers; but it is not so with the
                lawyers, only a good moral character is sufficient for them; then why should the
                quack be asked for his paper ?</p>
              <p>Mr. WOODARD. I want to say a word in regard to this bill. There is not a man in
                this House that has more respect for the medical profession than myself, but I
                believe they have already sufficient protection. If they are not sufficiently
                qualified it won't take the people long to find that out. There is no demand coming
                up here from the people praying this Honorable Body to legislate against quacks. We
                have not received any petition of that kind. I think sir, that men of every
                profession - in every department of life - ought to stand on their own merits, and I
                do not believe we ought to discriminate between classes. And while we have men among
                us vending patent medicines we are not obliged to buy of them; still I am willing to
                say that some of the best is amongst the patent medicines. When the people demand
                such a law as this, then let it be granted. But why should physicians come up here
                and ask for it? I say it with due respect to the profession; they want protection
                because it is to their interest to be protected. But it seems to me that if I were
                practicing medicine, and some quack were to take away my business from me, I would
                not complain in this way. Still when the people demand such a bill, then I would be
                willing to regard it seriously.</p>
              <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH. It is not the medical profession who are demanding this bill, Mr.
                Speaker. I voted against it the other day on this very ground; that the physicians
                of Indianapolis do not require it. They have not asked for it and they do not
                endorse it. Those physicians who are recommending it here are led by quacks. The
                educated physician does not want the protection of law; he can take care of himself
                But still there is nothing horrible in this bill. It simply provides that a man
                shall be what he pretends to be. If he is an Alloephathist he shall be endorsed for
                what he pretends to be - if he is a Homoeopathist he shall be endorsed by those of
                his own school - if he is a Hydropathist the same - and so with all the pathies. The
                provision of the bill respect the rights of the people. In the profession of law the
                quack lawyer can be thrown out of the bar by legal provision; though the
                Constitution allows every man who is respectable as to character to take the oath of
                the Constitution and be admitted to the bar. But there is no legal provision which
                throws out the quack in medicine.</p>
              <p>The vote was then taken on the motion to reconsider, and resulted - yeas 45, nays
                47.</p>
              <p>So the vote rejecting the bill was not reconsidered.</p>
              <p>A recess was then taken by the House for the purpose of receiving General Tom.
                Bennett, Governor of Idaho, when most of the members came forward and tendered their
                respects.</p>

              <p>Mr. MELLETT spoke briefly in support of the bill, holding that it was the duty of

              Cauthorn.</p>

            <p>The consideration of the tuition school tax bill H. R. 261 was resumed.</p>
            <p>Mr. LENFESTY obtained the floor and spoke against the bill, arguing that, under the
              new tax law, the fund obtained by the 20 per cent. levy would be unnecessarily
              large.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM thought the House should wait and examine fully the report of the
              Superintendent of Public Instruction. He did not like peace-meal legislation on the
              subject of education, but thought it best to have the whole matter referred to the
              Committee on Education, that they might report a sound basis upon which to build. He
              moved to make the whole subject a special order for Wednesday next at ten o'clock. </p>
            <pb n="352" xml:id="VAA8558-14-352"/>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN thought the people were ready to dispose of the question without debate.
              Better stop building State Houses, asylums and penitentiaries entirely rather delay
              putting our schools upon the proper basis. He did not believe the statement that the
              present levy under the new tax bill would largely increase the revenue, was well
              grounded. This is a question interesting every township in the State. It is not only
              an act of charity but of humanity ; and the public are demanding greater facilities
              for the schooling of the children. He hoped the bill would pass.</p>
            <p>Mr. COBB thought the new levy would raise as much as was needed. At least we could
              wait and see, and if the fund was found to be insufficient the next Legislature could
              increase the levy.</p>
            <p>Mr. RUMSEY presented a few figures, showing that there were 640,000 children to be
              educated; that with the present means the children in many districts are only afforded
              school facilities during the winter months. The average period in which the schools
              are kept open is but a little over five months, while the States all around us have a
              minimum of eight months.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY spoke in favor of the bill and of the principle of uniform taxation for
              school purposes. He wanted a tax levied sufficient to afford schooling for every child
              in the State, at least six months in the year.</p>
            <p>Mr. KIMBALL favored the postponement. All he had heard tended to convince him that
              this would be the better course. The mere raising of the fund would not be sufficient.
              We need a compulsory education law.</p>

          <p>Mr. Mellett's bill [H. R. 261] for an act to amend section 1 of the Common School Law,
            March 6, 1865, was taken up in order - the question being on the second reading.(It
            purposes to raise the school tax from 16 to 20 cents on the $100, and provides that said
            sum shall be expended for tuition purposes alone.)</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT. This is a bill in which the House should be interested. It has been
            revised and amended in the committee since the convening of the regular session of the
            Legislature. The only point in it is to raise the revenue from 16 to 20 cents on the
            $100 of taxables. It is a well known fact-recognized by every gentleman - that the
            present term of our common schools is not long enough; and the only question is, how to
            increase the length of the term; whether you will do it by levying an annual general
            tax, bill proposes, or by local taxation? For myself, I must say, that so far as this
            mere trifle tax is concerned, I am in favor of increasing this revenue by a general tax,
            and if that revenue will not give a sufficient increase of the term, let it be done by
            direct local taxation. I think we ought to have at least six months in every year for
            the term of the free common schools throughout the State. Now, on an average, we have a
            term of not more than four months; and in some counties not more than three. The
            statistics of the Superintendent show that something should be done, positively and
            speedily. It has been urged by some that the bill would be more acceptable if it
            provided this revenue by local taxation ; but I think not. It may be true, that by this
            bill the wealthier counties will have to suffer a heavier assessment than the poorer
            ones; that the wealthier districts will pay more for the support of the school than the
            poorer districts. Grant it. Marion county; for example, under this bill, would pay more
            into the school fund than she would draw out of it. She does that now, I believe. But I
            think this should not be considered an evil, when we consider the advantages which
            Marion county enjoys in other respects. Surely Marion county should not urge such an
            objection at this time, especially, while she enjoys the benefits resulting from the
            neighborhood of so many of the public Institutions of the State. And then, if we put the
            question on general principles, it is correct to say, that property should educate the
            people. Wherever there is a community too poor to educate its own children, it is the
            duty of the State to see that this is attended to. In many localities it would work
            hardships to require the support of a free school for six months of the year. It would
            require a tax which the people would not bear. Some townships are sparsely settled and
            would require a large per cent. of local tax; and some townships are poor in23 <pb
              n="354" xml:id="VAA8558-14-354"/> soul; and these are the places where education is
            most needed; and it becomes the wealthier counties to extend a helping hand in these
            directions. Every member whose people are so fortunate as to be in such a position
            should be glad that he represents a wealthy county for the opportunity which this bill
            furnishes of bringing the people on a level in this matter of education. - It is
            absolutely necessary that this school levy should be increased. It is demanded from all
            parts of the State; and I hold that there is no way in which it can be done so
            acceptably as by increasing the general tax.</p>

            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
            <p>The Speaker resumed the unfinished business of the morning announcing the
              consideration on the second reading of Mr. Mellett's Common School twenty cents
              tuition tax bill [H. R. 261]</p>
            <p>Mr. LENFESTEY referred to legislation just completed by this General Assembly, which
              he alleged would add to the revenues (including the common schools) a half million of
              dollars. Then in the second place we have passed a general law for the appraisement of
              real estate. By section thirteen of that act it is provided that appraisements of real
              estate shall be at cash value - three times what it has been and what it is at this
              present time. Then we have a law provid ing for a tax of sixteen cents on the $100 for
              school purposes. We have thus already provided a school fund to the extent of at least
              three times what it has been heretofore. This is very liberal legislation for common
              school purposes, by which we should secure at least one hundred and fifty days of free
              school in a year. I believe that we should not provide a fund unnecessarily large. But
              now, this proposition for raising the tax, from 16 to 20 cents on the $100 will make
              the school fund at least four times what it has been heretofore, and I believe we have
              legislated sufficiently in this direction; and so far as that fund is concerned I
              believe this bill should not pass.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, that we are not pursuing the proper course
              in regard to this matter. We have not yet received the report of the Superintendent of
              Public Instruction, which is supposed to furnish the data upon which we can take
              action on this subject. We ought first, to be in possession of all the information
              that can be given before we vote on this question. We ought to scan the system
              closely, and see if we cannot get along without this additional levy - at least with
              less than is here proposed. My opinion is, that this matter is of so much importance
              that instead of canvassing one portion of it to-day, and another portion next week, it
              would be better to make the whole question the special order for some future day; and
              if it takes a week to come to some solid basis of conclusions for the purpose of
              carrying on the common schools it will be time well spent. I know what it is to take a
              course here that will be regarded as in opposition to the common schools; but I will
              not vote for any part of a system, until I can understand the whole. Until that time,
              I shall not vote for this bill. When we can get the report of the Superintendent of
              Public Instruction, then I would like to take up all these bills. I would like to ask
              the Chairman of the Committee on Education how that would suit his views?</p>
            <p>Mr. MELLETT. It would suit me for my part.</p>
            <p>Mr. COBB. The report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction is already out.
              Gentlemen can find their copies in the Post Office.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. Then I will submit a few words more, in order that gentlemen may
              understand my view, - which I suppose will not control the vote of any man: but it
              will control my own. We have not schooling enough. In almost all incorporated cities
              they have as many days schooling as is needed. Is not that so? If that is so, then
              there must be some reason why the country schools are not kept long enough. And it is
              proper that we should know what these reasons are; and then, whether it is proper for
              us in the remedy it will be for the House to decide. But when we decide upon the
              length of time for the schooling, we ought to hold in our hands the power to regulate
              the schools and make the terms equal all over the State. In some fifteen or twenty
              counties perhaps, you will find schools in the country with not more than ten or
              fifteen scholars. Now it occurs to me that some of these schools might be consolidated
              with others; and I would like to ask the Chairman of the Committee what effect this
              would have on the schools? I move that this whole matter be postponed until next
              Wednesday at ten o'clock and made the special order for that time and that the special
              order be continued until the subject he disposed of.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. I do not see why it should be so hard for to understand any subject
              connected with education. This bill is a proposition to increase the tax from 16 to 20
              cents on the one hundred dollars, for the purpose of sustaining the common schools of
              the State. It seems to me that we can understand this subject as well to-day as at any
              other time; and I think we had better stop <pb n="355" xml:id="VAA8558-14-355"/>
              building State houses and all other considerations until we can place our schools in a
              proper position. Why should we sit here and talk about taxation, and hesitate, and go
              home without increasing this levy of 16 cents? This bill proposes but 4 cents more,
              and it is for the benefit of the people - it is to give intellectual food to thousands
              of poor children of the State, and let them have that needful measure of education
              which is now kept from them by the non-action of their representatives. It is a
              measure in which the people of every township of the State are interested. But it is
              said that the Lesislature has increased the taxation to such an extent that the
              present levy will be sufficient. The gentleman from Grant [Mr. Lenfestey,] says the
              school fund has been increased three or four times. The difference which has been made
              in the basis of taxation I think will not increase the fund to that extent, for so far
              as it effects notes and bills receivable it does not increase the levy at all. But
              suppose it does increase the fund three times that would only give six months
              schooling. And if we had school six months in the year we would only stand in this
              matter along side of some of our sister States. But sir, we ought to regard our system
              of public schools as merely in its infancy ; and it devolves upon the Legislature as a
              duty to see that this system has a healthy and permanent basis. This is so plain that
              it does not require debate or explanation. It is a simple question whether or not this
              tax of twenty cents shall be levied. Now why should we put it off? Why make it a
              special order? If it were a bill to erect an Insane Asylum a penitentiary we would not
              talk about order of its consideration. This is a question which should command the
              consideration of statesmen. The point that I make is, that we cannot but fully
              understand the question of raising this levy four cents on the hundred dollars, to
              carry on the common schools, for the benefit of the children - the wards of the State
              - who are lifting up their hands in petition for it, and when they ask for bread I do
              not want to give them a stone.</p>
            <p>Mr. COBB. I have a habit of regarding my vote here, as for the advancement of the
              common interests. It would be very difficult for me to vote otherwise. But then there
              is one thing that seems to have escaped the attention of the gentleman who has just
              now spoken so eloquently. We have at the last session of this body made a radical
              change in our system of taxation; and, to the best minds, it must be as yet but a
              matter of conjecture, as to exactly how that change will work. If we have doubled the
              levy, we have, in effect, doubled the amount that will he derived from the school tax;
              that is, it will be equivalent to raising the levy from 16to 32 cents. But I think if
              we will raise the levy but one half, we will do very well. If we do this, we will have
              what is equivalent to a 24 cent. levy. Now, if there had been no change in the basis,
              I would have been willing to have gone 5 cents higher than this proposition - willing
              to have raised it to 25 cents on the hundred dollars. But I think we have accomplished
              this object in another way. The <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName> have
              told us that they expected to get one hundred millions more from the present
              assessment than we got before. That will increase the tax about one third; and I think
              the sum will be at least duplicated in our county. I think that we may safely say that
              we will raise the amount of taxables to what would be equivalent to raising the school
              tax to about 24 cents on the hundred dollars. Now this is conceeded by gentlemen on
              all hands, and I do not think it needful for gentlemen to argue, as champions for
              common schools, to have any further increase of this fund. For it seems to me that we
              have provided for a sufficient increase in this direction. At all events, there is no
              doubt that there will be a very considerable increase. Then would it not be wiser for
              us, to let this matter rest until we may see the result? Then, if that should show
              that we have not provided a sufficient amount of revenue, the next Legislature can
              increase the present levy. My own opinion is, that that levy of 16 cents, will be
              equivalent to an increase on the old basis of assessment of from 4 to 6 cents.
              Gentlemen say that, in in our school system, we compare very favorably with other
              States. One reason for this is, not the want of being liberal in this regard, but
              because we have an unfortunate provision of law that there shall be no local taxation
              for school purposes. In other States they compel each district to have a certain
              number of days or months of tuition. For instance, in the State of Illinois they
              provide that the districts shall not receive their proportionate share of the school
              fund unless the people thereof make up a certain amount. But we cannot do this unless
              our Constitution were changed. And it seems to me that if there were no other reason,
              for a convention of the people to change our Constitution, that this alone would be
              sufficient - to so change our fundamental law that we may fix this matter, so as to
              compel those who control this fund to manage it economically. In Illinois they provide
              by law for seven months schooling - in Ohio for eight months in the year.I do not
              remember the amount of their levy. But until we can get our Constitution changed in
              this particular they will be in advance of us. It seems to me that we are about as
              well prepared to vote on the question of the passage of this bill as we can <pb
                n="356" xml:id="VAA8558-14-356"/> be; and on account of what I have said I think it
              would be unwise to raise the tax.</p>
            <p>Mr. RUMSEY. I desire to call the attention of the House to a few figures on this
              subject. This question suggests itself to my mind: Who are we legislating for? What
              number of persons are we legislating for? What is the number of children who are
              depending on the action to be taken here? The total number is nearly 700,000. - There
              are 640,000 of our school population. It is a notorious fact, in all the schools of
              the rural districts, that, from the commencement to the close of the cold weather,
              four-fifths of this large number of children are confined to that rugged season of the
              year for the time when they may get their education. Now what do we want in Indiana?
              What is demanded of gentlemen occupying these seats? We find that in this State,
              according to the Census, we have 127,000 persons who do not know their right hand from
              their left hand, with respect to written words and figures, and how do we compare in
              this regard with other western States? We are perhaps only a little behind the State
              of Ohio, with a population 33 per cent. greater than ours. What is the average of our
              common school term? In 1868 it was 4 35-100 months, and this year 5 8-100 months,
              whereas in all the States around us, except Kentucky, the school term is from 7 to 8
              months of the year. Now what is the cost of these schools according to the report of
              the Superintendent - the cost per capita? Three dollars and forty-six cents only, for
              each scholar for one year. Now we propose to raise this levy about twenty-five per
              cent, and yet gentlemen talk here of extravagance! Let gentlemen look back at their
              own early school days, who have not had these advantages of common schools, and then
              consider their duty to provide for these nearly 1,000,000 of their children and vote
              grudgingly, if they can, for 4 cents more of this levy, which will give twelve more
              tuition days per annum. Our Constitution has wisely prescribed that we shall provide
              for common school education; and therefore I hope that the House will not vote against
              this bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. As I assisted the gentleman from Delaware [Mr. Mellett,] in drawing this
              bill, I would like to occupy a few moments in discussing it.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. As I understand the question before the House, it is on the adoption of
              my motion to make this whole subject the special order for Wednesday; and because the
              report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, has been laid on our tables since
              noon we ask for time to look at it.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. Those who have had care of our schools system tell us, that one cent, on
              the hundred dollars taxables, at the present valuation, adds only three days annually
              to the term of the common schools; and, if one cent gives three days, four cents will
              give twelve days - that is all. Gentlemen say that we will largely increase the tax
              duplicate by the assessment act of last session; and I hope we may; but I do not want
              to stop at a twelve days increase of the term. I had no such idea in the drafting of
              this bill. I stated, at the special session, that we wanted to give to each child in
              every school district six months schooling in each year; and by demanding four cents
              more for the levy, we will not reach more than that. And when, by my vote here, I
              shall have given these six months of schooling, I shall feel that I have done the best
              thing that I can do here. We say that this twenty cents levy shall be expended solely
              for tuition purposes. It is not to be thrown away. The sole purpose of this bill is,
              that this money shall be so expended as to wipe out the odium of the State in this
              regard. I will say this further, that while, by the assessment acts, you will increase
              the taxables more than one third, I have some fears that we will loose nearly as much
              as we will gain, for we have been in the habit of taxing property which we cannot now
              reach. But now we propose four cents increase which will give 12 more days of
              schooling; and I am satisfied, by the calculations I have made, that your new levy
              will fall short of six months schooling. Gentlemen say that it will work hardships on
              some individuals and localities; but I say, it is just as hard for a man who has one
              thousand dollars on the duplicate,It is just as hard work, and just as difficult for
              him to pay his tax, as it is for the man who has his hundred thousand dollars. And the
              poor man has to pay his fifty cents poll-tax, equally with the man of wealth, and
              whatever he has besides, he is taxed upon it the same ratio as is the man of wealth. I
              say, that those who are able to do it, should educate the poor. That is one of the
              secrets of the ignorance of letters - it is simply because the people are not able to
              pay for education ; but when you come to tax the rich to educate them, they are
              unwilling. I want to say here to the rich: Educate the poor; and if you do not that,
              then are you not discharging your duty to society. I want to give to each school
              district a six months school - and, in localities where they want more, let them levy
              a local tax for it. And when they have more than six months, as is the case in the
              cities, it is because they have the local tax. I venture to say that there are many
              poor in this city who would get the benefit of this four cents levy.</p>
            <p>Mr. KIMBALL. I do not rise to make a speech, but merely to say that I am in favor of
              postponing this matter until next Wednesday. We should have more time to inquire into
              this matter. It seems to me that the <pb n="357" xml:id="VAA8558-14-357"/> levying of
              taxes, and the raising of money merely, will not remove the ignorance complained of.
              You may have millions for the purposes of Educatiod, but without a law compelling all
              persons to send their children to School, they will remain ignorant. - I have children
              to educate, and, of course, so far as I am able, I am willing to pay the taxes on what
              I possess for that purpose; and the people of Marion couuty are all willing to be
              taxed for that purpose. But while I am the friend of the poor man, and while I
              manifest it by my votes here, I will also, manifest the same, by voting also, in
              connection with others who are supporting that measure here, for the bill compelling
              the man to send his children to school where there is a law provided for schooling
              them. Whose fault is it that there are so many who cannot read and write? Take the
              common school age from 6 to 21 years, and they could all learn to read and write even
              with the tax we have now. But I want also to see if we cannot devise the ways and
              means to equalize this thing. The gentleman from Morgan and Johnson [Mr. Shirley,]
              declaimed eloquently in favor of the principle, that the rich ought to educate the
              poor. Well, I am willing - I acquiese in the doctrine. And what is the fact in regard
              to Marion County? We collect here for the general common school distribution over
              $60,000 annually 66,244 dollars. And our portion of that is 44,239 dollars - that is
              the apportionment for Marion county. Hence she distributes about 24,500 dollars to
              other counties. It does seem to me, sir, that, to be consistent to do our duty here,
              we should postpone this matter, and consider it well, before we act - I care not what
              tax you levy; but when we are called upon to contribute to the education of the people
              - when we are called upon to do this in Marion County, let us have some say so as to
              the question that the people shall be educated. I am in favor of compelling every man
              - every father and every guardian to educate his children to the extent that the
              public funds will reach. (applause.) I repeat, sir, that we want time to examine this
              subject. Let us legislate not only to raise the money, but to compel the children to
              the schools, and not establish a system of taxation that will not secure the desired
              result.</p>
            <p>The question was then taken on Mr. Branham's motion to postpone the subject until
              Wednesday 10 o'clock A. M. and make it the special order for that day - and it was

            <p> Mr. WOOLLEN'S bill [H. R. 10] providing for the issue and sale of bonds by civil
              townships for the purpose of paying any indebtedness incurred in the purchase of
              school houses, and to authorize taxation for the payment of such bonds, was taken up
              on the third reading. (It provides for taxation for this purpose not to exceed five
              per cent. on the hundred dollars of taxables - interest payable annually and the
              principal in ten years.)</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN, said: It gives to the civil townships the same right that cities and
              towns now have as to borrowing money for school purposes, if they desire to do so. It
              has been prepared with a great deal of care - that is if I am able to be careful - and
              it is guarded with restrictions. It will not be liable to abuse. I hope the bill will
              pass because I know of some townships that want it.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. If we (the State) have no right to issue bonds and put them on the
              market how can we authorize a civil township to do so? The Constitution expressly
              provides against the State creating any debt and if the Legislature can't do such a
              thing, how can we authorize the people to do it? - I might as well say at once, that I
              am opposed to the principle of this bill; and if we propose to fill the State with
              township bonds we are on the road to financial ruin. I want to say that in my
              judgment, forty per cent, of the cost of many of the school houses already in the
              State is a waste of money; and further, if the people want fine school houses, let
              them pay for them without incurring debts. There is a prevalent system of public
              extravagance in the construction of school houses, and the result is, that you can
              drive through the townships of the State and find many vacant school houses.
              Therefore, I say, if the people want to vote a tax for these purposes, let them vote
              it and pay it first, but don't allow them to issue bonds.</p>
            <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. If this bill become a law, it would empower the Township Trustee to
              select the districts to be benefited by the erection of school houses. That would be a
              very extensive power, and liable to abuse; especially as it is to involve the
              townships in debts by the issuance of bonds. I have not read the bill through; but it
              seems to me that it is not sufficiently guarded with respect to the power proposed to
              be lodged with the Township Trustee in locating the school houses, and in taxing the
              people for the construction thereof. If the author of the bill can satisfy the House
              that my objection is not well taken, I hope he will do so. - If this bill should
              become a law it would give to the Trustee the power of involving the townships in
              large amounts of indebtedness for the erection of school houses at pla- <pb n="359"
                xml:id="VAA8558-14-359"/> ces which, from sinister or other motives of his own, the
              Trustee might select.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. This, sir, is an unfortunate day on which to take up a bill in regard to
              school matters. The darkness which hangs in the atmosphere to-day must have some
              effect on us; members here must be in sympathy with the gloomy weather outside. The
              day is cloudy, there is not much sunshine here; and it may be that we should require a
              little more light to enable gentlemen to understand this bill. Now, the gentleman from
              Jefferson [Mr. Branham,] says this bill proceeds upon untenable grounds, and he
              questions the constitutionality of the act proposed; and yet, it has not been long
              since the gentleman got through the House a bill conferring the power of taxation upon
              his own township for the purpose of building a railroad in Kentucky; and the gentleman
              knows that the Constitution allows the people to build just as much in one township as
              in another.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. [interposing.] The law authorizes only a limited amount for the purpose,
              and the money to be first paid in. I never asked for an issue of bonds especially when
              there is no precise amount and rate of interest fixed at which the bonds are to be
              sold.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. This bill gives that. But what I was saying was, that the gentleman
              desired, and got legislation through this House for making a railroad in Kentucky by
              his people in Madison; and I voted for his bill. But when it comes to voting for a
              bill for borrowing money to build school houses the gentleman finds a constitutional
              objection, but I say to him now that effect of the bill is that, when the people of
              any township want to build a school house, they can petition the County Commissioners,
              and their petition can be granted as proposed. The bill confines the expenditure of
              the borrowed money to the one purpose - the building of a school house. There cannot
              be any abuse of its powers. It would be unheard of for a township trustee to locate a
              school house and spend the public money on it, at discretion to subserve his own
              interest. The gentleman from Gibson [Mr. Buskirk,] objects, because the trustee may
              select the site. But the trustee has the same power in this respect without this bill;
              and in my judgment it is better that the people should borrow the money specifically
              to build their school houses and pay their school house debts, than that they should
              raise the money in the ordinary way and let the trustee have the interest on it; for
              he may possibly loan out the money, pocket the interest, and so fix it, that the
              people will be in a worse condition than if they had borrowed it. There are cases in
              my own county where the school houses have gone down, and they want to build new ones
              immediately; and this is to give them the ready means. I cannot understand why the
              gentleman from Jefferson [Mr. Branham,] should say that forty per cent, of all the
              school houses are idle, and useless. I don't know where the gentleman has been
              traveling; but I do know this: that we want school houses in many places, and we want
              precisely this authority to build immediately. And I say further, that there is no
              objection urged against the bill, which could not be urged against any other public
              work; as, for schools in cities and towns. And we know that these township trustees
              are more careful in building their local school houses than are the authorities in the
              cities and towns ; because those monuments of extravagance are always found in the
              towns and cities, and we do not find them in the country. I do hope the House will
              pass this bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH. At the first I thought this bill was right; but discussion has
              changed my mind. I now take the ground of the gentleman from Jefferson [Mr. Branham.]
              - We need no such law as this bill proposes in our part of the State. They make their
              school houses there with sufficient facility, and some of them are elegant structures,
              as that in my own town. The effect of this bill will be to facilitate the erection of
              some elegant school house structures, at some favored cross roads, at the public
              expense, some four or five miles away from the center of the township. Townships you
              should remember, sir, are six miles square, more or less; and it is not right, by a
              majority vote, to tax men five miles away to build an elegant school house structure
              on some forsaken corner. That is the iryusiice of the bill, and I am glad that this
              discussion has brought it out.</p>
            <p>Mr. MELLETT. I agree with the author of this bill when he says, that this is a very
              unfavorable day for the consideration of a school bill. It is sorrowful to me also
              that any school bill should come up on a dark day. I think perhaps the best thing we
              can do with this bill would be to hand it to the committee along with the other. We
              are going to consider this whole subject on Wednesday and I think it would be well to
              consider this at the same time. The gentleman from Johnson [Mr. Woollen,] shakes his
              head. Another gentleman in my eye, the gentleman from St. Joseph [Mr. Butterworth,]
              seems also to object, but I insist that it shall go over till Wednesday. I think this
              is a question of sufficient importance to be gravely considered. The gentleman from
              St. Joseph says that his constituents can make their school houses well enough; and I
              understand that in his own town they have one of the most superb of these elegant
              school <pb n="360" xml:id="VAA8558-14-360"/> houses. But I know myself of many school
              houses that are a public disgrace; and if you want education to prosper in Indiana,
              you must keep pace with the age in this respect. It won't do to be content with
              sending your children to the log school houses with paper window lights and coon skin
              hangings. I insist that there is nothing improper in this bill. It allows each
              township to prescribe and regulate for itself as to what kind of a school house they
              will have ; and they can't proceed to build unless they can obtain a majority of the
              freeholders to back the work by petitions. If the people of any township in the State
              want to build a good school house, and can determine where to build, they have a right
              to do it. A right that should not be denied by this House. Let the people of the
              townships decide for themselves in regard to this matter. As far as the question of
              issuing bonds is concerned it is frequently a matter of necessity to tax the townships
              to build school houses which are absolutely demanded, and perhaps in most cases they
              would not impose a tax for bonds which the people could not pay in two years. Delays
              are dangerous. They can't afford to wait; and if they have not got the money let them
              issue their bonds; it will be economy in the end. I move that this bill be referred,
              to the committee of the whole House, and made the special order for Wednesday - next
              week.</p>
            <p>Mr. KIMBALL. In order to accommodate the gentleman from Johnson [Mr. Woollen,] I move
              to recommit the bill, with instructions to amend so that the bonds shall be sold at
              not less than ninety cents on the hundred dollars, and shall bear interest at not less
              than six per cent.</p>
            <p>Mr. CAUTHORN. Can we make it a special order if the bill is not printed?</p>
            <p>The SPEAKER. That would be no hinderance.</p>
            <p>Mr. MELLETT. I would prefer that the bill be recommitted.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. I hope the motion for the special order will not prevail. I do not think
              this bill has any connection with the other.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. I would prefer for the House to vote on it now, allowing the amendments
              proposed to be taken by unanimous consent.The amendments were adopted by consent.</p>
            <p>Mr. CAUTROHN. I am sorry now to be compelled to dissent from the opinion expressed by
              the honorable gentleman from Johnson; but I agree entirely with the gentleman from
              Jefferson in reference to this bill. I am opposed to the credit system? either by
              States, counties or townships. I think the bill authorizes the exercise of a power
              which is liable to abuse. I do not believe that there is a member in the House who is
              not in favor of common schools. Gentlemen who oppose this bill do so, not because they
              are opposed to schools, but because they are afraid of debts. The trouble about fine
              school houses in unfitting places, is well enough throw in by way of opposition to
              this bill. If the people are able to build, let them build without this bill. Our
              people at home had experience in this matter years ago, of which the reading people of
              the State have heard ; and we have paid the debt under difficulties according to
              contract. This bill will raise money to be put into the hands of sharpers, and it will
              not benefit the common schools. It will be better for the people to build as they get
              the money.</p>
            <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. I think our opposition here is in behalf of the school interests of the
              State, and I look upon my friend who opposes this bill as not an enemy to education.
              It seems to me if this bill becomes a law, that its practical effect will be to throw
              firebrands into every civil township of the State in regard to school matters. But few
              townships can afford those elegant school houses contemplated by this bill. A majority
              of the townships will find themselves able to build but perhaps two or three school
              houses. All the people of the township are taxed for the construction of these school
              houses, and perhaps many of them reside five or six miles distant, and receive not
              their advantages. More than that; the bill provides that the petition shall be signed
              by a majority of the inhabitants of the township; and I ask if there is not, right
              there the entering of firebrands? It will create needless bickerings in every school
              district in regard to school matters. It seems to me that, instead of that harmony in
              regard to the school interests which ought to obtain in the administration of the
              school law, this bill would promote the contrary. It seems to me also, that the credit
              system is all wrong. It had been said by the author of the bill, that a similar act is
              already on the statute books in regard to cities and towns. But that is not a parallel
              case. Suppose a town goes on and locates a school house; there can be no firebrand
              there in regard to its location ; but the case is far different in regard to the
              location in the township, for, if a school house is located in one corner, most of the
              people do not receive equal benefit from it. Besides this placing so much power in the
              hands of the trustees, who may be supposed to be under the control of the majority of
              the freeholders perhaps, instead of promoting the general cause of education will
              hinder it; and that is the principal reason why I feel opposed to the passage of the
              bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. MILLER. I will say with the gentleman from Johnson [Mr. Woollen,] that I <pb
                n="361" xml:id="VAA8558-14-361"/> have been surprised at the opposition to this
              bill. As far as the form of the bill is concerned I think it is perhaps as carefully
              drawn - as carefully guarded against extravagance and fraud - as any bill we have
              passed upon. It requires, before the township trustee can locate, that there shall be
              a petition for the location. That is the first step; it does not respect the style of
              a house they shall build. The next step is, the trustee shall get the consent of the
              Commissioners of the County. Here are a set of men disinterested - living perhaps
              entirely out of the neighborhood - to decide whether it is proper that the consent
              should be given. In the next place, the petition must come from a majority of the
              freeholders. Now sir, if the people of the rural districts were in the habit of
              bankrupting themselves by going into debt, perhaps we might hesitate; but we have not
              hesitated to give this power to the towns and cities who have so often taxed
              themselves severely for railroads and other purposes; but I have yet to hear of a
              single town that has incurred a burdensome debt by taxing themselves for education ;
              and if there is a set of men in the world more careful than the farmers about assuming
              any kind of indebtedness I have not met them. I believe that this consideration alone
              is sufficient to authorize us to trust this bill. Moreover, we have already a law by
              which the people of the cities and towns have a right to tax themselves for these
              purposes. It was approved the 8th of December, 1865, and the amendment of it the 11th
              of March, 1867 ; and in all the time that has elasped since, I have not heard of an
              objection to this law. Then why is it that a man who happens to live at some cross
              roads, could be suspected of undue influence with those who are certainly competent to
              decide upon the question of the location, and of the taxing of themselves for a school
              house? Why compel the the farmers to send their children to the log school house
              because the Legislature is afraid to trust them with the power to tax themselves to
              build a school house? On page 39 of the report of the Superintendent of Public
              Instruction, that officer says: In 1871 there were 513 log school houses in Indiana.
              And these are not disappearing. It would be first rate if we could make a law against
              building them. In 1872 I find 547 of them. Then these log school houses are on the
              increase instead of decreasing. Instead of building the kind of school houses the
              gentleman from St. Joseph speaks of they have been building log school houses.</p>
            <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. [interposing.] You say for four years log school houses have been on the
              increase?</p>
            <p>Mr. MILLER. That was under the operation of a law passed six or seven years I ago.
              But as to these negotiable bonds bankrupting the townships, there is a provision in
              this bill that the amount of the debt shall not exceed five per cent. of the taxables.
              Practically, these bonds would not go out of the neighborhood. There are always in
              every community, old farmers that have money, and those bonds will be sought out by
              them. Commonly, I say, they will be absorbed right in the neighborhood. People that
              want to build School houses will never premit these bonds to go abroad. I can see no
              reason why we should not allow the majority of the people to tax themselves for the
              purpose of Education.</p>
            <p>Mr. KIMBALL. I dislike to oppose any thing which my friend from Johnson brings in,
              but I shall oppose this bill, not because I am opposed to Education, but because it
              seems to me that the people are becoming a little wild on the subject of taxation -
              and when the end is to be I do not know. The credit system has been alluded to in this
              debate, and I am willing to say that this system of extravagance has been carried too
              far. If a township wishes to build a better school house, let them do it. It has
              occured to me that the people of Indiana have been unjustly attacked in the mattter of
              the lack of schools; for they have even carried the building of school houses to an
              extravagance. My remark is drawn out by the remark of the gentleman from Deleware [Mr.
              Mellett.] He says it is necessary to build fine school houses in order to draw the
              children of those who live in palatial residences. In the same manner we may be called
              upon to compel the children of all classes to attend the schools, and it is not the
              needy and worthy portion that are to be benefitted by this bill any way. It does seem
              to me that the people of Indiana should be content to let well enough alone that they
              should educate their children as they should be educated - that they should take some
              of the money with which they would build extravagant school houses and employ
              qualified teachers. Here are the railroad aid taxes, and the tax to procure tuition in
              the schools, and then comes this fine school house tax. But when the tax comes to be
              paid, then it is that the people will begin to inquire into this matter. - Why sir,
              during the campaign the cry was that the people are dragged down with taxes; and now I
              think is is time to stop this taxing in every unnecessary particular.</p>
            <p>Mr. RENO. I believe the people of the townships can determine what is economical and
              safe for themselves better than we can; and, if I understand the bill, it leaves the
              matter altogether with them. I know that where it is left to the people this matter
              will be taken care of. It is a well known fact <pb n="362" xml:id="VAA8558-14-362"/>
              that the farmers of Indiana have to furnish the States, money; and can't we safely
              leave to them the question whether they will tax themselves or not? They are men of
              economy, and if they want a school house they should instruct their trustees to build
              it. I see nothing in this bill that can create alarm.</p>
            <p>Mr. THOMHSON of Elkhart. The gentleman from Decatur [Mr. Miller,] compliments the
              honest farmer. I can tell that gentleman that the farmer is no more honest than other
              men. Now here is the interested Trustee desiring and dictating the site for a new
              school house, and he goes into another part of the township and they all accommodate
              him by signing his petition to go before the County Commissioners; and so half dozen
              school houses in the same township are to be built in one year. That would be the
              resultoin many cases the inevitable working if the bill of the gentleman from
              Johnson.</p>
            <p>Mr. MELLETT. I wish to make an explanation, in annwer to the assertion of the
              gentleman from Marion, [Mr. Kimball,] that ''it is not the most worthy portion of the
              people that are to be effected by this bill anyway"; and he has called up Delaware
              county prominently before the house. I will now say to him, that, in one of the outer
              Town- of that County, there is a place, that, from the top of a certain building, you
              can count six school houses, and all these school houses what are they worth? - they
              would not bring 25 cents a piece at public auction. They have all gone down. The hogs
              could creep into them when the doors are closed - the little hogs, I mean. I am giving
              the gentleman a true account of some of the school houses in the country.</p>
            <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH. [in his seat.] Which is thus! [Laughter.]</p>
            <p>Mr. MELLETT. It is thus for this reason; in answer to the question: It is simply
              because the attempt to rebuild any of these school houses would be the political death
              of any township trustee. The trustee is elected by the people. He has the
              discretionery power to levy the tax or not - no need of getting the voice of the
              people in the matter. He takes all the responsibility of building the house; it is his
              house; and the hue-and-cry that would be raised against him would defeat him next time
              for the office. But in this bill you provide that he shall receive his instructions
              from the people; he is only the creature of their will in the matter; and I think that
              is the right way to proceed. There ought to be some way provided, so that when the
              people want a school house they may have it; that they may be allowed to build it with
              their own money. I can say again, that its not the wealthy gentry that are to be
              benefitted; they can send their children to the colleges to be educated. There is no
              occasion for concern about them. Its the poorer classes, that can't send their
              children abroad, that is to be benefitted by this bill.</p>

            <p>The Senate proceeded to the consideration, on the third and final reading, Mr.
              Harney's bill [S. 122,] to legalize, in certain cases, appropriations made by County
              Commissioners to aid in building railroads previous to May 12, 1869, declaring such
              appropriations subscriptions to stock, etc.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. I am opposed to the principle of releasing county officers from liability
              to the people for acts entirely illegal; and I am opposed to setting a precedent for
              Legislatures legalizing acts entirely illegal. And I don't believe we can do it. I do
              not believe that this or any other Legislature can make that legal which was not in
              itself legal. If the Railroad Company was willing to issue the stock, and the county
              was willing to take the stock, and it was a fair equivalent for the amount of money
              paid, I would have no objection to the law,but where the stock is almost worthless it
              seems to me it is a bad precedent, and to pass this bill would make us look a little
              wrong some how or other, in my estimation. When these parties took that money they
              took it as a gift, and now after they have had it six years, and it is found out they
              are not entitled to it all, we propose by an act of the Legislature to make it a
              contract requiring stock to be issued for the money received. After a court has
              decided that money could not be required from the Railroad Company, because the whole
              proceedings was illegal, I don't see how we can make that thing legal.</p>
            <p>Mr. CHAPMAN. Section six of Article X of the State Constitution reads </p>
            <p>:SECTION 6. No county shall subscribe for stock in any incorporated company, unless
              the same be paid for at the time of such subscription; nor shall any county loan its
              credit to any incorporated company, nor borrow money for the purpose of taking stock
              in any such company; nor shall the General Assembly ever, on behalf of the State,
              assume the debts of any county, city, town or township, nor of any corporation
              whatever.</p>
            <p>I take it that the county has got to know how much stock they want to take and must
              have the money to pay for it at the time.</p>
            <p>Mr. O'BRIEN. If this bill would have any affect it would have the affect to legalize
              the subscription of stock to Railroad Companies, and I do not think the Legislature
              can do that in view of this provision of the Constitution. With that view I cannot
              vote for the bill; and on general principles I am opposed to legalizing illegal acts
              anyhow.</p>
            <p>Mr. O'BRIEN said the bill was unconstitutional. The sixth section of article ten of
              the Constitution provides that no county shall take stock in any incorporated company
              unless the money is paid at the time of subscription. This money having been paid
              years <pb n="364" xml:id="VAA8558-14-364"/> ago no act of the Legislature can override
              this section of the Constitution and authorize the county to receive stock in return
              for the donation.</p>
            <p>Mr. DAGGY, with the view of giving the Senate a proper understanding of how this bill
              came to be introduced, gave the facts as they exist in this case. He said that before
              the passage of the railroad act of 1869, the Commissioners of Montgomery county made a
              donation in aid of a railroad and the money was placed in the hands of a trustee.
              Before it was paid to the railroad company an injunction was granted against such
              payment, and a case was made up which was carried to the Supreme Court. That Court
              decided that the Commissioners had no authority to make the donation, and the act of
              the Com-misssioners in making the appropriation was absolutely null and void.
              Meantime, however, the trustee died and the money passed into the hands of his
              representatives by whom it was finally paid to the railroad company, and the road was
              built. An application was made for an order of court to require the Commissioners to
              return the money to the county treasury, which application is still pending. This
              bill, he said, would not relieve those who held the money from liability, but will
              give the county an additional remedy, enabling it to recover the value of the donation
              by taking stock in the railroad. By the provisions of this bill it is left
              discretionary with the county to recover the money or not. If this bill passes they
              may recover by taking stock, and that becomes a healing of the matter and ratifies
              arid confirms the appropriation. This is not obligatory on the County Board. The only
              question is the power to adopt this measure. As to the equity of it there can be no
              question, and it can do no harm to pass this bill. They have paid the money, cannot
              they now take the stock? I think they can. I think I have given substantially the
              force and effect of this bill and I think it is fair. The only objection raised
              against it is its unconstitutionality; and that is a question for the courts and not
              for the Senate.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS thought there was no force in the objection. At all events the end may
              be accomplished in this way, by agreement between the railroad company and the present
              County Commissioners. The railroad can return the money to the Commissioners and they
              can then immediately subscribe for stock to the amount of the donation and pay the
              money back to the railroad.</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH. It occurs to me that there is no necessity of passing this bill for the
              purpose of releiving the people that may be similarly circumstanced. If the facts are
              as I understand them from the Senator for Putnam [Mr. Daggy,] it seems to me the
              county has a right to institute suit against the Railroad Company to recover the
              amount of money it has been instrumental in abstracting unlawfully from the county.
              And they may have a lien fastened upon the railroad.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS [interposing.] Would that lien take precedence as a mortgage?</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH. I suppose it would - being for money used in the construction of the road.
              It was given to them unlawfully, and the creation of a trust did not make it lawful.
              It was as unlawful for the trustee to pay it over, as if he had not been a trustee.
              They had no right to appoint a trustee; but they were men conspiring to abstract money
              from the county treasury, and that money the Railroad Company subsequently invested in
              building their road. I think there is no legislative aid needed, and suit may be
              instituted now; because money has been unlawfully taken from that county and used in
              the construction of this road. I understand the object of the introduction of this
              bill is to aid the county.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. I desire to ask the Senator: Does all contracts for labor in building
              railroads take precedence of a first mortgage?</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH. That is a different question.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. Does it?</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH. I presume not.</p>
            <p>Mr. H. thought there was no occasion for this additional remedy. The county now had
              its right of action against the railroad and that was sufficient.</p>
            <p>Mr. HARNEY explained that this bill was drawn up and introduced with reference to
              cases where County Commissioners had made appropriations to aid in building railroads
              previous to the passage of the law authorizing counties and townships to vote a tax to
              build railroads, approved May 12, 1869. The Supreme Court has decided that all
              appropriations made as donations by the officers of a county for any such purpose
              previous to such enabling act was absolutely void being without the authority of law.
              The Constitution authorizes counties to take stock in a railroad company where the
              stock is paid for at the time. From this premise we conclude that where an
              appropriation was made and the money paid to aid in the construction of a railroad, it
              must have been in payment of a stock subscription before the transaction can be
              clothed with the form of legality.</p>
            <p>But it is suggested that legistation is not necessary - let the courts determine the
              question! The necessity of legislation originates from the fact that there is no means
              provided by law to enforce a contract for payment of stock. The county has a right
              without the adequate means of enforcing it. </p>
            <pb n="365" xml:id="VAA8558-14-365"/>
            <p>Besides that, should the county attempt to collect from the raidroad company the
              money thus wrongfully taken, in most of cases the road is so covered up with
              transfers, leases and mortgages that recovery is out of their power, and thus the
              company continues to enjoy this benefit of their own wrong. The bill is not mandatory;
              it only authorizes a settlement by payment of stock if the county should choose to
              accept it. Again the law is necessary in order to name and characterize a class of
              transactions hitherto not known nor defined in legal proceedings. The transaction is
              not a theft or felony because the officers were presumed to have acted under a
              misapprehension of law in good faith. The party receiving the benefit claim they
              received it as a donation and have placed it out of reach of the proper owner, and,
              therefore, are exempt from liability except on the terms on which they received it,
              while the injured public are virtually plead out of court because the injury
              complained of is not defined by statute. Really the money paid was converted by the
              company into capital stock, and formed part of the basis on which it conducted its
              transactions, and therefore it is right and competent for the Legislature to declare
              all such transactions where the money had not been returned "a subscription to the
              capital stock," and provide the means for enforcing the payment of the same to the
              county which made the appropriation. The motion is of some importance to the people of
              our county, and perhaps others. The constitutional objection raised has been answered
              successfully, and I suggest this further that under the Constitution while County
              Commissioners may take stock, they have no right to make a donation.</p>
            <p>Mr. H. said the railroad was covered up with mortgages, and had passed by lease and
              otherwise to other railroads, so that it would be almost impossible to identify it or
              get at it on execution. The bill is not mandatory. It only authorizes a settlement if
              the county chooses to accept it.</p>

          <p> The House met 9 o'clock A. M., the prayers by Rev. Mr. Bayliss, of Roberts Park, M. E.
            Church of this city.</p>
          <p>The reading of the journal of yesterday was dispensed with.</p>
          <p>Mr. ANDERSON submitted a motion to reconsider the vote of yesterday by which the House
            concurred in the report of the Committee on the Judiciary for the indefinite
            postponement of his bill [H. R. 342] for an act to provide for the taxation of costs in
            criminal cases, and he said: I consider that this bill is correct in principle on this
            subject, and that the subject deserves the candid consideration of the House. I know of
            no legislation more needed than this. The present criminal laws make no provision for
            the payment of the costs in criminal prosecutions, unless the defendant is found guilty.
            This, I will say in the first place, works injustice and hardship to the witnesses, who
            have to attend for the State at great inconvenience and expense, and frequently without
            their own county; and in most cases where the State loses the case, the defendant is
            unable to pay them and the State will not so the service has to be rendered - is
            compelled to be rendered without any compensation whatever. I do think, sir, that this
            injustice should be remedied - should be provided against in some such way as I have
            proposed. But I have another objection to the present law. There is a rule in the
            criminal practice, that all the doubt as to the guilt of the accused shall go to his
            benefit. Now I undertake to say that in a great many cases - I do not say in the higher
            courts but in a great many cases before Justices of the Peace, it is my conviction,
            resulting from my own observation, that the benefit of the doubt goes not to the
            accused, but to those who are to get the fees - the costs - and so this good old rule of
            the law is subverted. To illustrate what I mean: Suppose that when the viewers are
            selected to go out and view any proposed route for a road, and there is a condition made
            and understood that these viewers shall be allowed compensation if they report
            favorably, and not otherwise, I presume there is no man but would say that such a
            condition must affect the judgment of the viewers, for they must, in order to receive
            their own pay render a favorable report. And if it does not go that far, at the least
            you would say that it places the viewers in a condition where they might make the change
            in the road against their own proper judgment. Where the road might be of doubtful
            propriety, the viewers would give themselves the benefit of the doubt. I think the;
            would do so in many cases. And just in this way, I think it is, that, for want of such
            an amendment as I propose, our criminal laws have a direct tendency to invade the right
            of the accused in any fair trial. Then again, it often happens that the panel for the
            jury do <pb n="367" xml:id="VAA8558-14-367"/> not try the case, and the Sheriff
            summonses another. And now, in such a case - where the Sheriff has been put to a great
            deal of trouble and expense - where he has been compelled to send out deputies to one
            place or another, it is but reasonable to say that he would feel some interest about
            indemnifying himself,and here is the plain statute, that he gets no costs if the
            defendant is cleared,now is it not reasonable that in such a case the Sheriff would
            select from amongst his friends those whom he could rely upon for rendering a verdict
            favorable to his Interest in the case? - a verdict for the condemnation of the
            defendant, so that the Sheriff might get his fees of the State? And every witness in the
            case is directly interested in the same way. My impression is that the statute should be
            amended in this particular. The lovers of good order and the law-abiding men in every
            county would have no objection to being taxed for this public service, and I can see no
            better way than that these costs should be entailed upon the county. I merely wish this
            reconsideration for a deliberate vote of the House.</p>
          <p>Mr. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I think that the vote of the House concurring in the report of
            the Judiciary Committee ought tostand. The object of the bill was that where a criminal
            action is prosecuted and fails, and the accused is not able to pay, that the fees of
            Clerks, Sheriffs and witnesses in such cases shall be paid by the county. Now, it seems
            to me that the law ought not to be altered in this way. I undertake to say, that so far
            as our court costs are concerned, the amendment which the bill proposes would double the
            amount of the costs now necessary to carry on our judiciary system. It is true that in
            some cases I have heard complaints that the present law does work hardships. But the
            Supreme Court has decided that the Sheriff accepts his office knowing the law, and that
            the ordinary fees of his office are made so high, that he can afford to lose them when
            the State does not succeed in the prosecution - that his fees are made high enough to
            indemnify him. I have not heard any general complaint from any source, even from the
            Sheriff on account of this decision. It is generally said that the Sheriff gets ten
            times as much compensation in his fees as the actual amount of service would justly
            entitle him to. It seems to me that these temporary hardships are just like the
            hardships we suffer by the requisitions of the law for military service, or for working
            on the roads. These as a general rule work hardships equally severe, and not very unlike
            those to which the gentleman has referred. But a man has to suffer in this way but a few
            times perhaps in all his life; and I think it is better thus to suffer than to make the
            proposed change. Then there is this fact: if a man who is a witness in a criminal case
            is very poor, and is compelled to attend court out of his own county, it is common for
            the judge to pay the expenses out of the county funds. As to the inducement of the fee
            to make a witness swear hard against a defendant, I can hardly think a man could take
            that into consideration when he comes on the stand under the solemnities of an oath. To
            think otherwise must be to take a very groveling view of human natureto think that a
            witness could be induced to swear falsly because of his compensation of seventy-five
            cents or a dollar and a quarter a day - and besides all render himself liable to a
            prosecution for perjury. But it seems to me that such a law as this bill proposes would
            increase the number of prosecutions of malicious prosecutions - especially on the part
            of those persons who take the low view of human nature which the gentleman supposes. If
            such were the law, and if such a person were assured of his pay, the prosecuting witness
            might not be so careful about having a good cause of action. If such a man knows that
            when he goes before a court he will get his pay for the service, it seems to me that to
            make a law giving him that assurance would be an act for the encouragement of criminal
            prosecutions. He is encouraged, because whether the State fails or succeeds he is bound
            to get his compensation. And so also, I think such legislation would raise up a large
            class of professional jurors.</p>
          <p>The vote was reconsidered; but the House again rejected the bill - yeas 35, nays
            40.</p>
          <p>And so the bill failed.</p>

            <head rend="center">
              <hi rend="sc">[CONTINUED FROM MIDDLE OF SECOND COLUMN PAGE 72.]</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Mr. WALKER, from the <orgName>&gt;Judiciary Committee</orgName>, reported back Mr.
              Heller's bill, (No. 236) providing for taking the sense of the people on the question
              of calling a constutional convention without recommendation.</p>
            <p>Mr. WALKER said the committee did not feel warranted in making any recommendation.
              The House should determine the question for themselves.</p>
            <p>Mr. HELLER spoke in support of the bill as follows: Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt
              that a majority of the members upon this floor, and also a majority of those who
              dispense the law throughout the enitire State, are satisfied that a change has become
              necessary in our organic law; or, in other words, they favor a change in the present
              constitution, or at least, in many important provisions of that instrument.</p>
            <p>Now, Mr. Speaker, while I am not entirely clear as to my duty in the premises, I am
                <pb n="368" xml:id="VAA8558-14-368"/> fully satisfied that a convention <hi rend="i"
                >will</hi> be called, and at no distant day, regardless of what many of us may
              require or wish. This being the case, according to all the indications, the only
              question that remains to be decided is, who shall and who is the proper and rightful
              authority to call a convention? All power is derived from the people, and when a
              question of so much moment demands action it is but just that those who are most
              directly concerned, and whose interests are affected should be consulted, in order
              that the greatest number may be satisfied and our action justified.</p>
            <p>I do not clearly see the real necessity for a call, as we all well know there is a
              way provided for amending the existing instrument. Tedious though it may be, I
              consider it the great redeeming feature of the instrument itself. If we look back <hi
                rend="i">behind</hi> its birth but a few years, we find that the commonwealth of
              Indiana was insolvent - <hi rend="i">i. e.,</hi> unable to pay her just debts; unable
              to fulfill her contracts. The best confirmation of this assertion is the passage of
              the <hi rend="i">Butler Bill</hi>, and thereby obtaining a final settlement with her
              creditors. This not being sunicient to relieve her from embarrassment, a convention
              was called to frame a new constitution. The legitimate result of the labors of the
              able men called to do the work incumbent upon them, went into effect November 1,
              1851.</p>
            <p>Now, Mr. Speaker, a casual glance at our crippled condition before and at the time
              the present instrument was born into life, as compared with our growth and progress
              under its beneficient and benign provisions, affords such a palpable and glorious
              contrast that we should, at least, be slow to swap away what has made us powerful,
              rich and respected, for that which has not even been conceived in the womb of its
              maternal progenitor, and what will cost us thousands upon thousands of dollars to
              simply bring about the proper marital relations by which it may be conceived and
              brought into real life.</p>
            <p>As I said before, the present constitution went into effect on the first day of
              November, 1851. How long, may I ask, did we remain upon our backs? Why, sir, in less,
              almost, than no time, we stood erect, proud and haughty, the peer of any of the States
              that repose their greatness on the bosom of the wonderful Mississippi Valley in point
              of credit and honor. Yes, sir, she was brought to this high financial standard in the
              short space of ten years; and we find that a ruinous civil war of four years duration,
              drawing upon her resources to the enormous amount of thousands of men and millions of
              money, prevailed during all that devastating period; and yet her finances remain
              uncrippled, her honor unstained, and with the robe of majesty encircling her gracious
              form.</p>
            <p>With all this staring as squarely in the face, dare we leap unadvisedly into the jaws
              of what may turn out to be financial ruin, dishonor, and a weakened organic law?</p>
            <p>But it is said by the friends of a convention, that <hi rend="i">some</hi> of its
              provisions need amendment; that certain parts have fallen behind the wants and
              requirements of the present age! Granted; but then, sir, does not the instrument
              itself provide for all necessary changes? They tell us the process is too slow! So
              much the better. No excited faction can, under this provision, change or mar the face
              of the instrument by a single blow, to the detriment and injury of those who provide
              the sinews of government. If a change is attempted, time is allowed for the sober
              second thought to take the place of the passions of the hour, and correct any abuse
              that may be attempted. Besides, by the process now provided, not one dollar of extra
              expense is incurred, because it is done when we are called here to transact the
              ordinary legislation which the business interests of the State demand; and the
              finality is given it at the regular election held for other purposes. If a convention
              is called, besides the risk to all classes in the State, the expense will amount to
              thousands - yes will run into hundreds of thousands of dollars! It must be remembered
              that not less than from four to six months time will be actually necessary to complete
              the labors incumbent upon the members of said convention.</p>
            <p>But, Mr. Speaker. I am fully satisfied a convention will be called, regardless of the
              wishes of a respectable minority upon this floor. And here, let me say, up to the
              present time it has not shown itself to be a party measure. We are somewhat divided,
              without regard to party lines. Now, sir: with this state of facts before us, what are
              we to do? Squarely oppose the will of the majority, that our constituents may look to
              the record and discover that we have simply cast a vote in the negative? No, sir, such
              action is too much like the conduct of the ram that attempted to butt the engine off
              the track: shows excellent pluck, but desperate judgment!</p>
            <p>I have been beaten so often politically, that "kicking against the pricks" has proved
              itself to be an unwise and losing game. I have learned, after long and sad experience,
              to accept the situation of affairs, and pursue such course in the premises as the
              indication of coming events present. With all this in view, my duty becomes plain. We
              have lived and prospered under the present constitution for twenty years; we certainly
              should not now be afraid to risk it for two years longer, and give the people a voice
              in the matter? Let them <pb n="369" xml:id="VAA8558-14-369"/> say through the ballot
              box, yea or nay whether they are willing to pay a half million of dollars for a few
              slight changes in their organic law, when the same may be accomplished without
              price!</p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I do hope this bill will pass, for my support can be lent to no other
              way of proceeding in this matter. We need n new Capitol building. We now have to pay
              the Garrett and other bonds that the people supposed canceled a quarter of a century
              ago! We must have new prisons, alms house and additions to some of the old ones. Extra
              appropriations are asked for, and extensions to the institutions of learning. The
              benevolent appropriations are crowding upon us thick and fast. The ordinary machinery
              of government must be kept in motion; all these things require an immense outlay of
              money. The already over taxed people are always crying for relief; without their
              united support all becomes weakened! Then let us be careful how we trifle with their
              hard earnings! It is not our right to squander their substance without their consent.
              They are the only ones that have either the moral or legal right to dispose of their
              own means!</p>
            <p>The Constitution of 1816 gave place to the present one. The internal improvement
              system was cut away, and an important fundamental principle of government was thereby
              secured. The sad lessons of the past should be sufficient warning, that in what we are
              secure should be husbanded, and preserved with more than common honesty and
              earnestness. We should surround all that is good with impregnable safeguards, and be
              slow to risk all by the throw of chance! Everything is safe in the hands of the
              people; it is their concern, and not this small body of men collected here as their
              representatives only. For us to take all the responsibility, without consulting our
              constituents upon so grave and important a matter, looks like transcending our powers,
              and assuming an arrogant authority not in keeping with the institutions of freedom.
              Therefore I hope the House will pass this bill. No possible harm can come from such
              action.</p>

            </head>
            <p> The bill [H. R. 27,] to regulate the rate of interest on judgments, the special
              order for 10 o'clock was taken up.</p>
            <p>Mr. SLEETH moved that Mr. Steele's amendment to limit such rate of interest to six
              per cent, be laid on the table. The motion was agreed to by yeas 27, nays 15.</p>
            <p>Mr. CARNAHAN moved that the bill and pending amendment be indefinitely postponed, the
              amendment being the one offered by Mr. Gooding, providing that the law shall not
              affect any contract heretofore made.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Brown, the question was divided and the vote was first taken on
              indefinitely postponing the amendment, which was lost. The question then recurred on
              the indefinite postponement of the bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. HARNEY spoke in favor of the motion. He said: The reason I desire this bill
              should not pass is that the tendency of legislation recently has been in favor of
              capital. A few years ago the legal rate of in-est was six per cent, and that was a
              restriction to some extent on capital. The Legislature afterwards passed a law that
              interest at ten per cent, should be taken on contract. I never could see any reason
              why the rate of interest should be increased. Money is not worth ten per cent. No man
              in debt who pays that rate of interest can extricate himself. The effect of this bill
              will be to plunge the unfortunate debtor still further into difficulty. I do not
              propose to argue the general proposition; or set forth the effect it has upon
              community, but I do think it is worth our attention.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN said the remarks of the gentleman would apply very well on the question of
              the reduction of the rate of interest, but not to the present question. The bill will
              simply compel a man to live up to his contract. And as far as the debtor is concerned
              he believed it would be an advantage to him to require a strict fulfillment of his
              contracts. As far as the State was concerned it would certainly be an advantage as it
              would bring capital into the State.</p>
            <p>Mr. CARNAHAN. My views in relation to this matter are different from those of the
              Senator from Jackson [Mr. Brown.] My view is that one of the main objects of law is to
              take care of the weak as against the strong. This subject has been before the
              Legislature more or less for the last fifteen years. I go against any legislation for
              the advantage of money over labor. Let any gentleman take ten or twenty thousand
              dollars to buy a farm with, and stock it, and then make a minute calculation of the
              profits and he will find not a farmer in the State will annually realize three
              and-a-half per cent. upon the capital invested. Why should great rate of interest <pb
                n="371" xml:id="VAA8558-14-371"/> be allowed for money? It simply gives advantage to
              monied men and grinds down the face of the poor laboring man. I am decidedly in favor
              of putting money and labor on an equality. Therefore I am in favor of indefinitely
              postponing the bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Lawrence. When I disagree with the experienced and able Senator from
              Posey [Mr. Carnahan,] I do so with some doubts. His experience as well as his ability
              entitle his views to great reaped in this Senate or elsewhere. It seems to me,
              however, that his argument is not round. It seems to me this is not legislating
              against the poor man, but rather legislating in the interest of the laboring man. I
              can very well imagine that a capitalist under the present law, would be willing to
              lend his money to men who was able to pay and who would be likely to pay at the time
              the money becomes due; but he would not be so likely to loan to a poor man who hadn't
              the ability to pay at the time he intended. And why? Because if compelled to sue on
              the contract he knows the moment he takes judgment he has to take but six per cent. My
              notion is this: That by this law, and the collection laws now in force in this State,
              we have been driving capital away from us. Why is it that money is scarcer in Indiana
              to-day, than in the State of Illinois or any of the States surrounding us? Simply
              because our collection laws are very defective. We hold out no inducements for capital
              to come here. If you hold out inducements to capitalists their money will come here,
              and the prices paid laboring men will be good.</p>
            <p>Mr. CARNAHAN, [interposing.] Which would you prefer to be?</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Lawrence. I would prefer to be a money lender; and if the Senator
              would always have the people of Indiana to be borrowers all he has to do is to
              continue the present laws in force. If you bring capital here you will build up the
              manufacturing interest and develope the resources of the State so that we will in time
              become independent of money lenders in the east. I am opposed to the indefinite
              postponment of this bill for another reason. It seems to me good faith requires that
              when I go to the Senator from Dearborn, and borrow his money and in my note stipulate
              that I will pay ten per cent. interest until the money is paid; that that contract
              requires that I shall pay ten per cent, until he gets his money, not until he gets
              judgment. As the law now is you are paying a premium to the man who disregards his
              contract. Here is the learned Senator from Montgomery [Mr. Harney,] who would have
              this Legislature still say to the people of Indiana - to every man who owes money and
              has given his note promising to pay ten per cent.: "Sir, when that note becomes due
              refuse to pay it, allow it to become due and we will take off four per cent. and allow
              the plaintiff to recover six per cent. instead of ten." When I agree to pay ten per
              cent. it seems to me I should pay that until the debt is satisfied.</p>
            <p>Mr. ORR. Having the highest respect for the judgment of the Senator from Posey [Mr.
              Carnahan,] I must beg leave to differ with him now. He says the object of the law is
              to protect the weak from the strong. I never understood it was for that purpose. I
              understood it was to protect and do justice between man and man whether he be weak or
              strong - not to protect the weak against the strong, be they right or wrong. I am in
              favor of the indefinite postponment of this bill. By custom the people have made ten
              per cent, the rate to be taken for interest. Suppose I borrow $1000 from the Senator
              for Jackson at ten per cent, and I refuse to pay it back when due, should the State
              enable me to violate my contract and allow him only six per cent.? I know many cases
              where notes are allowed to go to judgment in order to avoid the ten per cent. The
              present law is wrong, and hence I am opposed to the indefinite postponement of this
              bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. SLEETH. I think our State has suffered greatly in her commercial interests on
              account of the defectiveness of our collection laws. All the articles bought without
              the State are held at a higher price because of the difficulty of collecting debts in
              Indiana. The present law simply offers debtors a bonus of four per cent. to refuse to
              pay their debts and compel the creditor to go into the courts. This is certainly the
              most odious of our collection laws. We give the debtor a bonus to refuse to pay his
              debts when due. It seems to me it is time to legislate for justice as between the
              debtor and the creditor. It is high time to let debtors know that they must fulfill
              their contracts and pay their debts when they become due. The result would be a
              decrease of the debtor class and an improvement in the commercial condition of the
              State. Then we would not have such a large debtor class. But it is argued that this
              bill will operate against the poor man and in favor of the capitalists. I say that is
              not true. I appeal to lawyers to say what class employ them to collect notes. Bankers
              have to go into court, but seldom. Wealthy men, too, who have the privilege of
              selecting their borrowers, very seldom appeal to a court of justice to collect. It is
              in debts that arise out of business transactions in the middle classes - the
              mechanics, farmers, and merchants; and when they attempt to enforce the collection of
              obligations it is said they shall forfeit four per cent. of the interest stipulated in
              their contracts. We cannot stand here inno- <pb n="372" xml:id="VAA8558-14-372"/> cent
              and vote to indefinitely postpone this bill in the present commercial condition of the
              State, and justify ourselves before our constituents.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. We have had the present law in operation for sometime, and I have heard
              but little complaint of it. As the Senator from Rush [Mr. Sleeth,] has said the
              bankers are not in the habit of sueing a great deal simply because they prefer to let
              their customers renew their paper rather than let it go into judgments at six per
              cent. But, sir, you change this law and what will be the result? When they can make a
              judgment bear the same interest the note does they will not be so ready to renew. You
              commence breaking in upon a creditor with a suit and you make him pay the costs of
              getting a judgment in the court and add to that ten per cent, for attorneys fees -
              which you will always find plenty of men ready to swear is worth ten per cent. - and
              it maks a difference of $140 on a note for a thousand dollars. It encourages
              litigation and does great injustice to the unfortunate people who are forced into the
              courts.</p>
            <p>Mr. BOONE. I am in favor of the indefinite postponement of this bill. It is the
              policy of our law and Constitution to have business uniform throughout the State. It
              has been allowed by legislative enactment in this State that the rate of interest may
              be as the parties shall agree not to exceed ten per cent. provided it is expressed in
              the contract. It also makes six per cent. on judgments uniform. If this bill should
              pass there would be different rates of interest on judgments in the several courts of
              the State and in the same court. The proposition I believe to be in conflict with the
              general principle of the laws and the Constitution. I think it is unfair. In addition
              to this, it has been argued here that this is not a prop-sition in favor of the money
              lender but in favor of poor men. That may be the opinion of gentlemen who look at this
              picture from the side of wealth, but for those who look upon the picture from the side
              of the laboring men and the poor man, as some of us has had the misfortune to be, the
              condition of things is not so flattering. It is a matter of fact that men who loan
              money and who have means, understand the matter, and they contract against
              contingencies by contracting for Attorney's fees. I say this bill would be
              discriminating in the wrong direction. I should be rather in favor of the proposition,
              if the law is to be changed at all, that the contract have nothing to do with it, and
              that the interest should be ten per cent. on all judgments ; but I am opposed to
              changing the law as it now stands. I am not aware that any gentleman has failed to
              obtain credit because he lives in Indiana. The only question is whether he is
              responsible and a capable business man. Individuals with no property can obtain credit
              if their character is good. It is a question of character mainly. How many men are
              there in every community conducting business upon credit and going forward and being
              helped on by men ready to entrust them with capital, goods and material? The only
              question before the Senate now is whether we ought to changf this rate of interest on
              judgments; where it is the policy of our laws to have the rate of interest uniform
              upon judgments? All judgments are now running at six per cent. without reference to
              what the contract is. I think that is correct. I think that is right.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. It is insisted that it is not for the best interest of any community of
              men to borrow money. Look back over the history of this State and nation and tell me
              what would be the condition of this State to-day if he had not gone into debt. How
              many miles of railroad would we have if built only with the money of men residing in
              our own State? Where would we have been if we had relied only on our own resources and
              if we had not gone into debt? Where would have been the entire nation if we had not
              gone abroad to borrow capital in order to make public improvements? To-day there is no
              nation in the world so great a borrower in proportion to wealth as the United States,
              and there is no nation so prosperous as our people. And there is no other nation in
              the world that pays the laboring classes so well as the United States. Go to England
              where money is worth from two to four per cent, and how is it with the poor man there?
              How is it in any of the old countries where a low rate of interest on money prevails
              ?</p>
            <p>Mr. CARNAHAN. [interposing.] Do you not know that the proceeds of labor will buy as
              much provision there as the amount they get in the United States?</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. No, sir, I do not know that to be a fact. But, sir, if that is true,
              why is it that they emigrate to the United States by the hundred thousand every
              year</p>
            <p>Mr. CARNAHAN. There are so many people there they can't live.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. The Senator says men can draw as much provision from the proceeds of
              their labor, and why can't they live? If a man can get enough to support his family as
              well, why can't they live there? If the proposition of the Senator is true that the
              proceeds of labor will buy as much provisions there as here, I again ask why do they
              come to this country by the hundred of thousands? The reason of the large emigration
              to this country is because this is the place for the poor man. A man may here in a few
              years make himself independent. He may <pb n="373" xml:id="VAA8558-14-373"/> better
              his condition, and that is the reason why he comes. There is no nation so large a
              borrower as ours, as I said before, and there is no nation so prosperous. There is no
              nation to-day paying so high a rate of interest for the use of money, and I wan't to
              know how gentlemen account for our prosperity if is true that you must have a low rate
              of interest in order that the laboring men may get along. It is complained that our
              railroads are not owned by our own people, but in Europe and in New York, by men who
              has no personal interest in our State. Why is it? Because we have to go from the State
              in order to get money to build our railroads. Then is it not the true policy of the
              State to so legislate as to induce men to come here and expend their money? That is
              the best policy for the poor man in order that our mineral resources may be developed.
              I therefore think that this is really not a proposition to increase the rate of
              interest, but, admitting it is for that purpose, it seems to me every person should
              say: Make the rate of interest at what it really is. Why should we retain a law upon
              our statute books making six per cent, the rate of interest when every person in the
              land who wants to borrow has got to pay ten per cent?</p>
            <p>Mr. GOODlNG. I did intend to say something on this subject myself, but I think the
              discussion has been ample, and the time spent as much as should be required and
              therefore I move the previous question.</p>
            <p>The Senate seconded the demand for the previous question, and under the operations
              thereof the vote on the indefinite postponement of the bill resulted as follows :</p>

            <p>Mr. GOODING in explanation of his vote, said: By the passage of this bill without
              this amendment you will make the debtor class four per cent, more in debt than they
              srere at the time of making their contracts. By passing this bill we make it possible
              to ecover from them ten per cent, where only six per cent, could be collected. It
              would make many of those now in debt so involved as not to be able to pay. These
              persons understood and contemplated in the event of their inability to pay, that when
              their mortgages might become foreclosed the judgment would only bear six per cent.
              interest, and that is all they should bear. I offered this amendment not desiring to
              put the debtor class in any worse condition than they contemplated at the time they
              incurred their indebtedness.</p>
            <p>Mr. GREGG when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: If this
              provision goes into the bill, will it not have the effect to either compel parties who
              have paper due to renew it or at once stand suit? I am somewhat in doubt, but will
              vote "no." </p>
            <p>Mr. SLEETH, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: I vote
              against this amendment because I believe if it is right to make men live up to their
              contracts made to-morrow it is right to make them live up to those made yesterday. If
              a man has the purpose in his heart to violate a contract when signing it, we ought to
              come to the aid of the other contracting party and make him live up to his contract. I
              shall therefore vote against this proposition and if it carries I shall vote against

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The amendment provides that if the bill becomes a law it

                <p>Mr. NEFF in explanation of his vote, said that he was not opposed to railroad
                  companies, but if there was any one question on which he felt instructed, it was
                  to vote in favor of repealing the railroad tax law.</p>
                <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR then announced the vote as above, so the Senate refused
                  to lay the report on the table.</p>
                <p>The question being upon adopting the minority report - </p>
                <p>Mr. O'BRIEN said he thought action on the matter should be postponed until the
                  House had acted on the bill passed yesterday to amend the railroad tax law.</p>
                <p>Mr. GOODING said the unconditional repeal of the law would cause endless
                  litigation to the people, for instance, where the tax has been levied but not
                  collected. The bill passed yesterday afforded all the protection to the tax-payers
                  that they could ask for. If they don't want a railroad, all they have got to do is
                  to say so, and the contractors cannot force a railroad on them.</p>
                <p>Mr. DWIGGINS did not see any necessity for the repeal of the law. If counties
                  like Marion did not wish to aid in the construction of any more roads they were
                  not compelled to do so; but surely counties like those he represented ought not to
                  be cut off from an opportunity to avail themselves of the privileges afforded by
                  the law. In his counties a large proportion of the land is owned by non-residents.
                  Taxes have been levied and have been paid by the residents while, as a general
                  thing, the non-residents have not paid. Now, if this law is repealed, the taxes
                  already paid will go into the county treasury, while the non-residents will be
                  exempted, and will be profited at the expense of the residents.</p>
                <p>Mr. GREGG was in favor of the repeal of the law. He believed it a dangerous
                  policy to allow taxes to be levied for the benefit of any private corporation. The
                  Kankakee drainage question was here last session demanding our attention, and that
                  was legislation of this character. We are overtaxing the country. Produce in the
                  hands of the farmer has been declining, and taxes in every department of the
                  government is going up. I believe we have evidence from every quarter, that this
                  law works injurously, and there is a demand from every quarter of the State to
                  repeal this law. I have presented thin minority report that the Senate may give
                  the question a careful consideration.</p>
                <p>Mr. O'BRIEN moved to lay both reports and the bill on the table.</p>

                <p>Mr. BOONE from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned Mr. Brown's
                  bill [S. 107] with a recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed. (The bill
                  provides that a man shall not be disqualified from serving on a jury in the trial
                  of a capital offence on account of conscientious scruples on the subject of
                  capital punishment.)</p>
                <p>Mr. BROWN moved to amend the report so as to lay the bill on the table.</p>
                <p>Mr. BOONE said the bill was a virtual repeal of the 85th section of the act
                  regulating the criminal practice which reads as follows:</p>
                <p>"If the offense charged be punishable with death, any person entertaining such
                  conscientious opinions as would preclude his finding the defendent guilty, shall
                  not serve as a juror."</p>
                <p>With this restriction in the qualification of jurors in capital cases there had
                  been but few cases in this State for twenty years where that penalty had been
                  inflicted.</p>
                <p>The jury could now substitute imprisonment for life and it was generally done. I
                  was admitted that capital offences had <pb n="375" xml:id="VAA8558-14-375"/> very
                  much increased, and it was quite certain that the gentle manner in which criminals
                  of this grade had been treated under the law, had its influence in producing this
                  result. The perpetrators of the foulest murders are permitted to go free or be
                  imprisoned for life because of the conscientious opinions of jurors even when the
                  challenge is allowed, and it would certainly not make the result more favorable to
                  the public by removing this disqualification.</p>
                <p>The bill even goes farther and will not allow any inquiry whatever into such
                  opinions of a person called as a juror in a capital case. Its passage would be a
                  practical abolition of capital punishment in this State.</p>
                <p>He thought the State was not ready for this yet, especially when high crimes
                  seemed to be on the increase. Its abolition in other places had been followed by
                  an increase of capital crimes. Murders were committed for the purpose of obtaining
                  a few dollars, for any cause or no cause whatever, and the punishment no more
                  severe and often no longer in extent, than for larceny or burglary.</p>
                <p>He was in favor of indefinitely postponing the bill.</p>
                <p>Mr. BROWN said the bill did not look at all to the abolition of capital
                  punishment. It simply provided that the practice in criminal courts should be
                  consistent with the statute on that subject.</p>
                <p>Mr. Brown's motion prevailed, and the report as amended, was concurred in.</p>
                <p>So the bill was laid on the table.</p>

          <p>The SPEAKER announced the order of the consideration of Mr. Woollen's bill [H. R. 333]
            concerning the granting of Divorces - the question being on the final reading
            thereof.</p>
          <p>Mr. BOWSER proposed to recommit and amend the bill by adding a section providing that
            all actions for Divorce now pending, which have been commenced in good faith, shall be
            saved and exempted from the provisions of this act.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. The reason I did not save the cases now pending was, because I regard the
            present law as the occasion of immorality. If it is right that we should change the
            Divorce laws so to change the conditions upon which they may be obtained, then it is not
            right that a divorce should be obtained under the existing law. We go on the supposition
            that the law is wrong now. Hence I thought all the cases now pending should be stricken
            down unless they come under the profession of this act. I know that this is striking at
            the interests of some in my own profession : but while I am on this floor I will vote
            for all bills as a representative of the people, and attend to my cases and clients as a
            lawyer when I shall go home.</p>
          <p>Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH proposed to amend by providing in section 7, that no divorce shall be
            granted for any act commit-mitted whilst the parties were non residents of this State,
            under the said act so committed shall be a legal cause for a divorce in the State where
            the same was committed; and provided further, that no divorce shall be granted, except
            for the first of said causes, until three years after the date of the marriage, neither
            shall any divorced party be permitted to marry again within one year after the granting
            of the divorce.</p>
          <p>These propositions were rejected.</p>
          <p>Mr. SMITH moved to recommit the bill with instructions to add the following: "Provided
            that all actions for divorce now pending which have been commenced in good faith by bona
            fide residents of this act, and shall be exempted from the operations of this act, and
            shall be tried according to the law, as they stood when they were "commenced." - This
            bill (he said) proposes radical changes, and I think we ought not to make a law that
            would cut off these cases.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. Public sentiment for at least ten years has demanded these changes in this
            law. Honest men have had it thrown into their faces, that the divorce laws of Indiana
            were a disgrace; and that is the public sentiment outside as well inside of the State. I
            would say that the the proposed amendment should not be made, because these changes are
            undoubtedly required by the public sentiment of the State.</p>
          <p>I move that it be laid on the table.</p>
          <p>The motion to recommit with instructions was laid on the table.</p>

          <pb n="377" xml:id="VAA8558-14-377"/>
          <p>Mr. MILLER. I must say that this bill is a singular mixture of good and bad - some of
            its provisions are pernicious - nothing but perniciousness. - I will raise a few
            objections to some of its provisions. Right at the threshhold, in the second section, it
            provides that all marriages prohibited by law shall be absolutely void. Now, the meaning
            of this is: That all marriages, whether taking place in this or in any other State of
            the Union, or in any Foreign Country are to be tested by the laws of this State. Every
            marriage shall be absolutely void, and without legal warrant if it does not stand the
            test of Indiana laws!A law might be passed in Ohio in Illinois in Kentucky or Michigan,
            under which parties might get married, and at the same time becoming citizens of our
            State, under our law the marriage will be absolutely void. Now, I say, sir, that, acting
            under the courtesy that should exist between the Stales of this Union, such a law ought
            not to be carried into effect. - And probably it is unconstitutional. - Then it is
            possible that the children of such a marriage born in the State of Ohio might be
            legitimate there, but, moving into the State of Indiana, the father might be prosecuted
            in each case for bastardy: And I think then a suit of this character now pending right
            in the face of the law which has stood for twenty years.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. The law as it is forbids that. The gentleman will find in the bill; "if
            solemnized in this State." It should be there.</p>
          <p>Mr. MILLER. It's not in my print. - The next objection is in section six. As the law
            now stands, the notice is given by publication, that the party may come in and defend,
            as in a case for alimony. The Supreme Court has held that it is against public policy to
            disturb the ruling of the Courts granting a divorce. But this bill attempts to go
            further: it says judgement shall be be opened and allowed on the questions of divorce as
            well as in cases as to the amendment of alimony. Then there is another objection: it
            says that, until the expiration of two years the parties divorced shall not be permitted
            to marry again. That looks well at the first: but then sometimes an innocent party is
            granted a divorce - it is a divorce to both parties. Then the party who is not in fault,
            who has conducted himself properly, is absolutely prohibited from marrying again for two
            years. - But the other party, living or removeing just across the line in another State,
            is at liberty to marry again the next day. That is the objection here. It is something
            like the decision of a Justice of the Peace in any town: when a man filed a complaint
            before him for assault and battery, he acquitted the defendant and lined the party
            complaining. - The seventh section of the proposed act provides, that the person at the
            time of the filing of said petition, must have been a bona fide resident of the State
            for two years. I think that provision right: and that is about all we can do to make our
            divorce laws as perfect as they can be made. Now, these laws are nearly twenty-one years
            old - they have been substantially in force in our State from the beginning. What is it
            then that has created this pubic opinion against them of which the gentleman speaks,
            either within or without the State? In nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out of a
            thousand it is because we have been granting divorces to parties living outside of the
            State - to parties who have imposed on our Courts. But with this additional safeguard :
            that the party petitioning shall be a resident of Indiana for two years.I undertake to
            say that our divorce laws are as good as those of any other State of the Union. - On the
            subject of the causes for divorce - this abandenment for three years I consider too
            long. A married woman can make no contract that will bind : and the abandoned woman is
            liable to have her husband come back anytime during this period, and compel her to
            contribute her property to him and annul her contracts. I think two years would be long
            enough. The fourth cause in the bill "cruel and inhuman treatment" does not mend it
            much. Fisher, in his work on divorce, says, "cruel" and "inhuman" mean the same thing,
            It means that the husband must become a brute something not human: he must beat the wife
            brutally - treat her like a brute - before the Courts of Indiana can grant her a
            divorce. If it were but a mere matter of taste, I would leave both the words "cruel" and
            "inhuman" out of the statute. - The fifth of these "causes" is one to which I have
            serious objections - the habitual drunkenness of either party for three years. It might
            be first rate as an amendment to the temperance law. For three long years the party must
            have been an habitual drunkard: it is not to be occasional - it must be usual - it must
            be habitual to be drunk: and not only that, but the party must have been habitually,
            absolutely drunk for three years? This might encourage drunkenness in some cases; but
            still it is true of some drunkards whom I have known, that the first thing that has
            caused them to quit drinking, has been the fear that their wives would leave them. I
            know of one such case, where the first thing that brought the man to his senses was the
            fact that his wife had brought suit against him for divorce. But I think it would be
            working backward for us to provide that the husband shall have been <pb n="378"
              xml:id="VAA8558-14-378"/> an habitual drunkard for three years before such a step can
            be taken - it would be against public policy. - The sixth cause is, the failure of the
            husband to provide for his family for two years. So, for two years the man would have
            the right to avoid providing a living for his wife. I think the present law is better
            and safer than this. Whenever the Court conceives that the husband has failed to provide
            for his wife for a sufficient length of time to raise the persumption that he will
            continue to fail, that ought to constitute a cause of divorce. - The next objection to
            the bill is that it takes away the discretion of the Court as to the causes of divorce.
            This is an innovation - taking away a statute that has stood since 1852, and, with but a
            short interval, since 1831. In all that time this clause has remained: "and for any
            other cause which to the Court may seem proper." I undertake to say that in all the list
            of causes of divorce this is the best one - the best and wisest of all these
            provisions.I have seen stronger cases made out under that clause than any for the
            specially ennumerated causes; for they often come pretty near making out the cause - as
            the husband's drunkenness - his failure to provide, his cruel treatment, etc., He may
            have failed to provide for his family for the two years; but it is sometimes hard to
            make out the case with the requsite distinctness. He may not have care up to the full
            measure of the statutory requirement, and yet he may have transgressed in all these
            Courts. I know a case in which the husband was much older than the wife, and yet none of
            these causes could be proved. It was shown that she had left her husband; that she was
            ungenial to him, abused his children, etc; and yet the Court could not have granted the
            divorce if had not been for the discretionary clause.In twenty-ninth Indiana Reports it
            is held, that in many instances the causes for divorce may arise in which public policy
            demands that the parties should be separated; whilst the matinal statutory facts are
            unknown in the case the Court may be satisfied that the divorce should be granted. And I
            say again that it would not only be wrong to throw out this clause but it would be
            stultifying our State legislation on the subject for the last forty years. I am willing
            to leave a very large discretion in this matter to the Judges; and I remark that in Ohio
            and Illinois they have copied our law in this regard. We have been a little in advance
            of the age, instead of being a little behind ; and to-day there is scarcely a State in
            the Union which has not more liberal divorce laws, than they had in 1852 when our
            present divorce laws were enacted. - The author of the bill gets a little radical in
            Section 12. The law now requires the publication in a weekly newspaper - three
            successive insertions. - But this Section requires publication in the newspaper of the
            largest circulation, for the same term. Now it happens that such a paper is a daily
            newspaper: In one case the publication must be made in the weekly paper and in another
            in the daily paper, and in the daily it is for the same length of timeevery day for
            three successive weeks - that is twenty one publications. It would require that number
            of publications in this city, while in the smaller Counties it would be but three
            publications; and there is then inequality as to the expense. - These are the only
            objections that I urge; and they are good with me against going back and by this
            Legislation admitting that we have been wrong in our statutes upon this subject
            heretofore. I think it beneath the dignity of the State to repeal the statute because
            somebody has been talking and joking and writing about it; and where is the evidence
            that society has demanded these modification of the law regarding divorces?</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT. I do not intend to say much as to this bill, but it occurs to me that the
            effort of the gentleman from Decatur (Mr. Miller,) ought to have some attension. The
            gentleman has given us a very fine dissertation on the social relations, and I should
            like to have his speech preserved. I think it would go down very well side by side with
            the works of Judge Miller. He has certainly discussed the question up and down and round
            and round. But now there is but one question to be decided, and that is whether we are
            going upon the right principal - whether our present ideas upon the social relations
            subject are correct. Whether a man shall have one wife if he can get one, and shall not
            have two - Is that right? It is certainly an old fashioned idea, and I believe in it.
            But the gentleman may have taken up with the later ideas of the Claflin and Woodhull
            fraternity - and (shall we say it?) it must be that their idea is correct. But the
            question is as I state it: are we right? If that is the case that a man shall have but
            one wife and stick to her; he shall know that he shall have no divorce without just
            cause. But at least there would be no talking about the hardships of caring for
            illegitimate children coming into the State under this bill (laughter.) I think it has
            been justly urged upon this Legislature that our present divorce laws are a disgrace for
            you make orphan children when you separate husband and wife; besides putting the wife in
            such a case that she will never be able again to take her just position in society.
            There was an amendment offered to this bill for a <pb n="379" xml:id="VAA8558-14-379"/>
            saving clause here, and I am sorry that it was voted down. I would like to see it in
            this bill: not allowing either of the divorced parties to marry for two years. Would not
            the House make it one year? It does seem to me that it would be a wise provision to
            specify some time - one year, six months, three months - one year would be little time
            enough: for even I have knowledge of cases where divorced parties have not remained
            unmarried for an hour - where the new partner was ready to solemnize the new marriage as
            soon as the divorce was granted. And I believe the greater number of divorce cases have
            been carried up because the parties complaining have another marriage in view; and if
            that is the moving cause - to get out of the marriage relation in one case and get into
            that relation in another case - the parties should be compelled to stay out.</p>
          <p>Mr. WILLSON of Ripley. It seems to me that this bill is of as much importance as any
            bill before the Legislature. We are attempting to change the law on which the very
            foundation of society rests, and it behooves us to consider before we act. There are
            some provisions in the bill of which I am strongly in favor. We are attempting to erect
            a barrier against the frauds which are practiced against our Courts, by non-residents;
            but there are also some provisions in this bill which I think ought not to pass. I am
            not one of those who believe that we ought to go back to the dark ages. I do not believe
            that society and civilization have suffered - by the advancement of the ages. As far as
            the question of divorcement in Indiana is concerned she may well be proud of what - has
            stood upon her statute books for twenty one years. I see no need of any Legislation to
            prevent the Judges from doing as they ought to do; but we ought not to encourage any law
            under which the Judges have not done right. As far as I know of the workings of our
            divorce laws it is almost impossible for a party to obtain a divorce under them. We are
            ready to disfranchise a man because he drinks intoxicating liquors immoderately, yet
            here we will legislate so as to compel the delicate female to live with a man who has
            fallen below the brute for three years! Sir, I think drunkenness for a single hour
            should be made sufficient cause for a divorce; and I say this: if he have persevered in
            such conduct for any length of time I do not think he is worthy of the marriage
            relation. I do not think the marriage relation can be of benefit to man or woman where
            the parties are unfitted for each other. I believe this union is by a higher sanction
            than that which is recognized in Common Law; and so I believe it would be better for
            society to extend our liberality in this regard than to contract it. But so far as the
            foreigners to our State are concerned I think it is here that we find the source of
            impositions ; and if gentleman think a residence of three four or five years would cure
            this I am willing to make that provision. But, when a man has ceased to be a husband, I
            think in that case the Court ought to have power to annul the marriage. I know there is
            a sentiment on this subject which is not according to reason, prejudicial to our divorce
            laws, and held by those who take their impressions from the news papers; but now here
            this State prevents the granting of a divorce except for ennumerated causes, and giving
            a discretion to the Court. Any lawyer of experience in the Courts knows tba there are
            cases sometimes in which there is such a strong combination of all these causes (but
            without establishing one of them) which taken in connection would make a sufficient
            ground for a divorce - all combined would make even a very strong case. As in the case
            of abandonment. But, under this bill, if the husband comes back one day before the three
            years expires then the wife is bound to accept him as her husband. Then he may have been
            guilty of beastial drunkenness for years, say for half that time, and she may be
            compelled to drag out with him the miserable existence of a drunkard's wife. Upon the
            whole, then, I must say that the passage of this bill would be a disgrace to the
            Legislation of Indiana. I think we should pause before we take a step backward toward
            the darkness of the past. - What objection is there to this old law? Here it is, and in
            it are contained the only cause for which parties should be entitled to divorce; and if
            there is any cause specified here which should not entitle any party to divorcement then
            let it be repealed. These causes are: first, adultry; - second, impotency; - third,
            abandonment for one year. Surely that is long enough, If the man abandon the wife for
            that length of time, then the marriage relation should be dissolved. To compel the
            parties to live together after that would be to bind them in a social hell. Then we have
            these causes; fourth, cruel treatment by either party towards the other ; fifth,
            Habitual drunkenness by either party for one year; sixth, the failure of the husband to
            make reasonable provisions for his family; sixth, conviction of either party of an
            infamacy crime; seventh, any other cause for which the Court shall deem it proper that a
            divorce shall be granted. There is the discretion of the Judge under this last head,
            where offences in connection with the other causes are combined.</p>
          <pb n="380" xml:id="VAA8558-14-380"/>
          <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. If there were only the man and wife in the case - if nobody else were
            interested - we might submit to the loss of standing in society which the gentleman from
            Delaware referred to; but there is a way of granting divorces which affects society in a
            sensitive part, that is in regard to children, you may seperate the man and wife for
            many causes, but the serious consideration is the provision for the children. When you
            seperate man and wife you throw these upon the world, and stamp upon them a diepargement
            that will go down with them to their graves. Why, sir, if we could agree with gentlemen
            who oppose this bill, we might throw away the marriage relation, change this thing of
            marrying - do away with the ceremony, and make another code. Think of a man lifting his
            hand to heaven for the performance of the obligations assumed in this ceremony, and it
            is made a mere mockery by our divorce laws. If I had my way I would make these
            restrictions against divorcement even stronger than his bill. I say, if a man makes a
            pledge to a woman in marriage, he ought to fulfil his obligations with the utmost
            scrupulousness. Yet I am willing to go with gentlemen for amendment in all cases that
            are reasonable and right. Some gentlemen object to this bill because of the hardship in
            its application to foreigners, and especially because they escape the penalty of
            marriage immediately. But our power stops at the State line - our Legislation cannot go
            beyond that. The gentleman forom Decatur is in favor of leaving the words as they stand:
            "cruel" treatment for one of the causes - leaving out the word "inhuman". I am in favor
            retaining it, and I am also in favor of punishing those who will be brutish in that way.
            If you put a strong barrier against divorcements, when parties come to negotiate about
            marriage they will consider the matter a little more seriously - they will consider and
            avoid hasty and inconsiderate marriages, because they will know that they must take the
            consequences of a lifetime engagement. I am in favor of this bill, and hope it will
            become a law; so that when a man and woman marries in Indiana, they shall remain husband
            and wife. As to drunkenness as a cause, I think it should be well certified; and while I
            am in favor of protecting the wife from the drunken and brutal husband, if I had my say
            in this matter, I might sometimes blame the woman for it; for if I were in her place I
            would have the courage to say to him; I will not leave you for getting drunk, I will not
            be divorced from you for such a cause. The case of divorcement is too easily gained in
            this way.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. I want to say a few words in behalf of this bill. Only the most difficult
            parts as they occurred in the drawing up of the bill have come out in these objections;
            and even the friends of the bill have not gone into the matter so as to exhibit its
            merits. I think the great objection to the Indiana divorce laws has been occasioned by
            the facility with which foreigners could squat in our State and obtain divorcement from
            their wives in other States. A residence of one year has been sufficient - and it is now
            - to give the right to a divorce. This time is not long enough. This bill makes such
            residence two years. I should have made that as an amendment if I had not drawn the
            bill. Now these persons come here and obtain a residence in various ways, they will come
            here and buy an interest in some ten foot store, pay their rent on it, and go home.
            These impositions practiced upon our Courts have brought infamy upon the divorce laws of
            Indiana. For when the divorce is once obtained it stands forever. Although the
            defendant, the wife, may have been innocent, knowing nothing of the case, the divorce is
            granted forever, and cannot be reversed. Now the first good provision in this bill is to
            lengthen the time of residence - two years instead of one. The next good provision is
            that the residence shall be in good faith. The next good provision is that the residence
            shall be the same as that of any resident house-holder of Indiana - it shall be so
            proven - proven by resident witnesses - persons residing and being himself at the time a
            householder in the State of Indiana; so that all whom it may concern may know precisely
            where his witnesses may be found, and if they have perjured themselves they may be
            handled for false swearing. The old law provides that the publication shall be made in a
            weekly newspaper, so that the party living out of the State may possible hear something
            of the case. But in ninety nine cases out of a hundred it has been made ineffectual.
            This bill improves the old law in this respect: if a party obtain a divorce from and the
            party living out of the State, it provides that the defendant shall have two years time
            to open the case; and during that time the complainant - the carpet bagger who has come
            here for that business, is deprived of the privilege of marrying again. My friend from
            Decatur (Mr. Miller,) objects because this publication shall be in a weekly and daily
            paper, but that is a good provision; because in a County where there is a daily, a large
            portion of the people do not read the weekly papers, and these are the places chiefly
            where we want the notices to go. Now I wish to speak very briefly of two or three of the
              <pb n="381" xml:id="VAA8558-14-381"/> causes of divorce; and, first, of that in the
            bill prescribing abandonment for three years. I would have been willing to vote for this
            bill if it had said for two years. What the gentleman from Ripley (Mr. Willson,) said
            about leaving the wife to suffering for three years I think a little exaggerated; for no
            Court would allow such a man to perpetrate such a fraud upon an innocent wife. The Court
            would say at once that when the absconding husband returned and offered himself, as he
            might prove, the wife very properly declined to recive himthat when he professed that he
            offered himself and went away again the Court would say he perpetrated a fraud, and
            intended to do so; if the wife declines to live with him it is sufficient to show the
            abandonment "cruel and inhuman treatment." The old law says "cruel" treatment. I know of
            one lady who was divorced because her husband tapped her on the shoulder. I know of
            another case where the husband had children, and the wife went to her mother, and staid
            there from fear that they would maltreat her. The Court decided that it was cruel
            treatment. We must put language into the Statute which the Court is bound to abide by
            and observe, for I know that the abuses of this law belongs in some cases to the Courts,
            and we must frame the law so as to avoid that; hence we combined these words "cruel and
            inhuman." But let it be remembered that the husband who is cruel toward the wife is
            amenable to the criminal law. The next provision is drunkenness for three years. No man
            will become a confirmed drunkard at once. There is no man who is a man, but his wife can
            reform, and the law should give her at least three years for her work. It is through the
            course of years that a man becomes a confirmed drunkard; and if the wife has the right
            spirit - if she has the proper affection for the husband - if she clings to him (as
            somebody has said) "like the vine to the riven oak"she will cling to him through three
            years - aye, three times three years in such a trial, and through all this period the
            wife's influence will have more power to reform him than all things else; and as you
            take away or as you shorten this period of probation you diminish and destroy the wife's
            influence - you take away from the husband the most potent influence for his
            reformation. It is the wife's influence that reforms the husband and this bill says she
            shall make the trial of it for three years: and if she have the right spirit she will
            not think it long; and the result will show that her time was well spent. The next
            "cause" in the bill is the failure of the husband to make reasonable provisions for his
            family for two years, the old statute says one year. This is a very short time, it seems
            to me. But, Mr. Speaker, the provisions of this, bill will have this effect; they will
            at least remove the odium of our present divorce law. When I came first into the State
            of Indiana, I observed, as a boy, the wonderful march of public opinion against us in
            this direction. I have heard young men and young ladies say amongst themselves that it
            is not a very serious thing to get married; for, if you are not pleased, you can get a
            divorce. The idea was that marriage is a mere experiment. And I think a pretty large
            number of marriages are made under some such impression as this; and with such
            sentiments in society as to marriage and divorce laws, I say that it is time to correct
            this evil - this pernicious public opinion, for the law becomes public opinion, and it
            should be placed on a higher plane of public morality, and be judged by higher
            standards. Let it be understood by the young, when they enter into this relation of
            marriage that it is not an experiment, but a solemn and legal and religious compact for
            life. Let this be understood, and divorcements will become extinct, and marriages will
            be contracted with right views of the sacred relations of husband and wife. - The odious
            seventh clause of the causes of divorce which has brought so much infamy upon our State
            is here abolished - that old clause which allows the Court for every cause which it
            might deem proper to divorce man and wife devolved too large a discretion upon the
            Judge. Which he had concluded - </p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD demanded the previous question; but he withdrew immediately for - </p>
          <p>Mr. CLARK, who said he was glad to hear the genteman from Johnson call the old divorce
            law infamous; but sorry to hear the gentleman from Ripley making light of the bill, as
            drifting back to the dark ages. It seemed to him that the family is the foundation of
            government. The greatest law giver that was ever upon earth, and whose laws above all
            others should be obeyed, gave but one cause whereby a man and his wife may be seperated.
            He considered that the gentleman from Decatur and others might be disposed to reverse
            that law so far as to give other causes for divorcement. He (Mr. C.) was from the State
            of North Carolina, and never knew of a case of divorce while he was there. The bonds of
            the marriage relation were stronger than these Statutes; and we should bring our
            Statutes as nearly as possible into conformity with the divine law. He considered
            himself supported in this declaration by <pb n="382" xml:id="VAA8558-14-382"/> the
            intelligence of the age, that the nearer we approach to the divine law in this respect
            the better it will be for us. This at least stands good back to the dark ages, but it
            seems now strangely to be an advancement to make our Statutes conform to the principles
            of Christianity! He added; I would be glad to see this bill bettered; but it is good
            enough to command my vote; and I hope gentlemen will all vote for it.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN desired to apply an amendment to the bill which had escaped his notice till
            the gentleman from Decatur (Mr. Miller,) called his attention to it. He desired to make
            the bill read in the clause something like this. "All unlawful marriages solemnized
            within this State shall be null and void without process of law."</p>
          <p>The SPEAKER. If there is no objection the amendment will be taken by consent.</p>
          <p>VOICES. "No, no."</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. I will then ask the House to refer the billl look at it from the stand
            point of the interest of the State. It is for that, that the bill has been drawn. If
            gentlemen do not consent that the bill may be amended as I desire, I will ask that it
            may be recommitted.</p>
          <p>VOICES. "No, no."</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. Then I desire to say to the friends of the bill that it can be amend-ded
            in the other end of the Capitol we can conquer there.</p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD now renewed his demand for the previous question; and there was a second,
            and the main question was ordered to wit: Shall the bill pass?</p>
          <p>The yeas and nays thereon resulted - Yeas, 56, Nays, 21.</p>
          <p>So the bill passed the house of Representatives.</p>

            <p>The House concurrent resolution, authorizing the appointment of a joint nelect
              committee of five on the part of House and three on the part of the Senate, to report
              on the 20th day of February amendments that they may think necessary to be made to the
              Constitution of Indiana, coming up - </p>
            <p>Mr. O'BRIEN said: The people expect and are prepared for the calling of a Conveution
              to amend the Constitution of Indiana. I do not think if the Legislature were to devote
              all the time we have left to that subject and nothing else, we could mature and
              propose such amendments, as ought to be made to the Constitution. If this Committee is
              appointed and agrees upon certain amendments is there any probability that the Senate
              will pass them? And is it likely that the next succeeding Legislature will endorse
              just exactly a set of amendments this Legislature would? For these reasons I think it
              impossible to properly amend the Constitution in this way; as there is a clause in the
              Constitution requiring two successive Legislatures to agree to the proposed amendments
              before they can be submitted to a vote of the people. I think this resolution proposes
              a waste of time, and that this Legislature has no time to waste in discussing the
              matter of amendments to the Constitution. More than that, I think when the organic law
              is to be changed the people should be consulted as to the propriety of the change. I
              am opposed to submitting to a popular vote any further amendments, and I am in favor
              of calling a convention of the people and let them alter, amend or revise the organic
              law of the State. If we refuse to do this we will refuse to do one of the things the
              people are expecting us to do - and we deprive them of an opportunity of saying
              whether they want a new Constitution or not. This General Assembly was not elected
              with a view of presenting amendments to the Constitution. When a Constitutional
              Convention is ordered the delegates will come together for that specific purpose.
              There is perhaps not a member here but who could suggest five or six different
              amendments. Therefore if no other Senator desires to discuss the question I will move
              to lay the resolution on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. SMITH. What harm would it do to pass it?</p>
            <p>Mr. O'BRIEN. Provoke discussion on a subject unnecessary to take up time with.</p>
            <p>Mr. GLESSNER. [Mr. O'Brien withdrawing his motion,] said: This is not a one-sided
              question by any means. The Senator proceeds upon the assuption that there is not
              sufficient intelligence in this General Assembly in the next forty days to propose the
              necessary amendments to the Constitution. Now it occurs to me that argument won't hold
              good. If we appoint a Committee and give them an opportunity to choose several
              amendments, we might possibly agree upon the report of the Committee <pb n="384"
                xml:id="VAA8558-14-384"/> at once. If we can adopt these amendments in the
              constitutional way and submit them to the people then we will have an opportunity of
              hearing from the people with scarcely no expense as compared with calling a
              Constitutional Convention. The Senator says we were elected without reference to the
              matter of amending the Constitution. We were elected two years ago without reference
              to the amendment of the Constitution adopted by that General Assembly and approved by
              this; so that is no argument at all. If in the wisdom of this General Assembly, it is
              thought best to propose amendments to the Constitution, and they are adopted by this,
              and the succeeding General Assembly, and are submitted to a vote of the people, and by
              them ratified, isn't it better we should do that than perhaps have no amendments to
              the Constitution at all? In two years or in twenty-six months from the last Geneeral
              Assembly we can, without the expense of calling a Constitutional convention, have the
              Constitution amended in every respect where we deem it defective. I believe this the
              proper course to pursue. Give this Committee an opportunity to consider these
              amendments and if they bring in such amendments as may seem proper we can adopt them;
              otherwise we can reject them.</p>
            <p>Mr. SLEETH. I hope this resolution will not be voted down at present. It can do but
              little harm. I cannot agree that the people of the State are expecting, and demanding
              a Constitutional Convention. I believe the people of my part of the State require us
              to try our hand, and if we can accomplish the same object a Constitutional Convention
              would accomplish, they require it of us without that expense. I do not apprehend that
              there will be very much trouble in agreeing upon amendments, and if we do agree upon
              some propositions that will be voted down by the people there will be no harm done.
              Let this Committee be raised and present their propositions here and we can all agree
              on them perhaps in half a day. The argument that we can't agree is the strongest kind
              of an argument that the Convention should not be called. If we can't agree how will
              the Convention? We might submit to the people, amendments to those parts of the
              Constitution that are defective, and if the propositions we submit are thought by the
              people to be no better than the,Constitution now is they can simply vote them down and
              no harm done. I hope the resolution will not be voted down, but that the Committee
              will be raised.</p>
            <p>Mr. NEFF. I am in favor of the passage of this resolution. I think it can do no harm,
              as the Senator from Rush [Mr. Sleeth] says, but I think it can do good. We can't call
              a Constitutional Convention and get rid of the expense much short of from three to
              four hundred thousand dollars, while we can amend our present Constitution, at the
              simple cost of calling an election of the people; and if we submit the amendments at
              the same time of a general election it will cost nothing additional. For this reason
              if for no other, I would favor the adoption of the resolution.</p>
            <p>Mr. SMITH demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the Senate.</p>
            <p>And then the resolution was concurred in.</p>

              <head rend="center">SALARIES OF JUDGES.</head>
              <p>The PRESIDENT pro tem announced the special order for this hour - 3 o'clockP.
                M.</p>
              <p>Mr. DWIGGINS moved to defer confederation of the special order - Senate Bill 19, in
                relation to the salaries of Supreme, Circuit, Superior, Criminal and Common Pleas
                Judges - until next Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Mr. O'BRIEN moved to lay the special order on the table, but withdrew his motion at
                the request of Mr. Steele, and the question therefore recurred upon the motion of
                Mr. Dwiggins, who also withdrew his motion, so that present action might be
                taken.</p>
              <p>The bill was then read. It fixes the salaries of the Supreme Court Judges at
                $5,000; those of the Superior Courts at $4,000; those of the Criminal and Circuit
                Courts at $3,000, and those of the Common Pleas at $2,500.</p>
              <p>Mr. GLESSNER. I move to recommit the bill, with instructions to strike out the
                provisions relative to Common Pleas Judges. We have bills before us looking to the
                abolishment of the Common Pleas Courts. We have some 20 odd Circuit Judges - some
                have plenty of work to do and some have but little. If the vote is pressed today I
                am not willing to pay Circuit Judges as much as I would if the bill introduced by
                the Joint Committee to abolish the Common Pleas, shall become a law; for the reason
                that now the burdens of the Judges are not properly equalized. Admitting that this
                subject has been deferred from time to time, a new condition of things have
                appeared, and it is as much necessary to postpone it now as before. I appeal to
                Senators to defer the further consideration of this bill until the question shall be
                decided as to whether the Common Pleas Court shall be abolished or not, and in doing
                so you will do the best thing for the men you are laboring in behalf of.</p>
              <p>Mr. HARNEY. The number of important measures we will have to consider admonish us
                that what we do we will have to do promptly. Therefore I am in favor of at once
                doing what we are going to.</p>
              <p>Mr. ORR. The same difficulty exists with me to day that existed when we had this
                subject up last. I must know what labor our Judges will be required <pb n="385"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-14-385"/> to perform, and until I know I can't do justice in
                voting for this salary bill, and would certainly have to vote against it if called
                upon to vote at the present time. Iam toId that some Judges only work some eighteen
                or twenty weeks in the year, and others some forty weeks. I would like to see this
                districting bill completed before I vote to compensate the judges.</p>
              <p>Mr. STEELE. I do not see the objection gentlemen urge against this bill. As far as
                the Circuit Judges are concerned they claim that they have more than they ought to
                do now; and I can see no reason why we sho'ld not give them a fair compensation. It
                is true we may alter and equalize Circuits, and we may do that as well after raising
                the salaries of Judges as before. Then why wait? If we legislate the Common Pleas
                Courts out of existence and see proper to have the work done entirely by Circuit
                Judges then we will have to remodel the whole Judicial System. Let us consider that
                a Circuit judge who works properly is worth so much to the country, and there is
                nothing more in the way of raising the salary at this time than at any other.</p>
              <p>Mr. SMITH moved to amend the bill by striking out the provision for Common Pleas
                and Circuit Judge.</p>
              <p>Mr. NEFF. I do not know whether thebill to make thirty-six districts will pass
                ornot, but going upon the supposition that itwill pass, then I would vote a
                different salary to what I will now vote, under our present system; therefore l am
                unprepared to vote on the question of salary. I am satisfied our Common Pleas Judges
                are not paid judges enough, and I think our Circuit Judges are not paid enough. We
                have twenty two Common Pleas and twenty-seven Judicial Circuits. We pay the Circuit
                Judges $2,000 a year, and the Common Pleas $1,500: 22Common Pleas Judges at $1,500
                is $33,000 and 27 Circuit Judges at $2,000 is $54,000; that makes $87,000 we now pay
                our Common Pleas and Circuit Judges. Under the present bill abolishing the Court of
                Common Pleas and proposing to pay Circuit Judges $2,500 a year we would be paying
                $90,000an increase of $3,000 over what it costs us to-day for both Common Pleas and
                Circuit Judges. Now if I knew just what was going to be done about redistricting the
                State I would be prepared to vote on the salary question, but as I do not know
                whether we are to have 36 or 47 or 48 districts; I am unprepared to vote. It is said
                that a member of Judges only work 20 or 30 weeks in the year, while others work 46
                or 47 weeks.</p>
              <p>Mr. O'BRIEN (interposing.) I would like to know what Judges works only 30 weeks in
                the year.</p>
              <p>Mr. NEFF. I believe the Circuit Judge in our district works about 26 weeks; and
                here are other Circuits, I believe, about the same.</p>
              <p>Mr. STEELE (interposing.) How many weeks in Randolph County?</p>
              <p>Mr. NEFF. About six weeks. And we have got a good working Judge. I can commend him
                for his good qualities both as a lawyer and a worker. I would be willing to pay
                these men large salaries if they would do a large amount of work. I believe the
                friends of the bill had better allow the matter to go over, or lay the bill and
                amendments on the table till after we determine whether we will continue the old
                system of Common Pleas and Circuit Judges. I am unprepared to vote on this question
                now, and I hear Senators on all sides of me say they are not prepared. I apprehend
                if you fix the salaries now you will have trouble n apportioning the State in proper
                sized districts afterward; but go at it and redistrict the State, and then you can
                tell what he work of Judges will be worth.</p>
              <p>Mr. THOMPSON. The Superior Court in this city sits 50 weeks, and Judge Perkins does
                more business than the whole Supreme Court. I am willing to vote that the Supreme
                Court Judges shall have a salary of $5,000 but I will vote against the bill if the
                salary of the Superior Judge is put one cent below what it now is in this bill. I
                will go for the bill as it is, but if you divide that bill - if you attempt to cut
                down the salary of the Superior Court, I shall vote against it on the principle that
                it is not just.</p>
              <p>Mr. SLATER offered additional instructions reducing the salaries as follows:
                Supreme Court Judges, to $3,500; Superior Court Judges, to $3,000; Circuit and
                Criminal Court Judges, to $2,500.</p>
              <p>Mr. O'BRIEN. I think the Senate is probably as well prepared now to vote on this
                subject as it ever will be, and for this reason I am opposed to referring the bill
                back to a Committee. Senators object to voting either for or against it because
                something else may be determined hereafter. It seems to me it is proper for the
                Senate to do right without reference to what may or may not be done hereafter. If it
                is right to increase the salaries of Judges, it is right to do it to-day as much as
                it would be next week or the week after. We were informed during the special
                Session, by a Committee appointed by the Attorneys of Indiana, that no State, I
                believe, in the Union demands the same service of her Judiciary that we do for the
                same amount of money. I am in favor of paying a reasonable salary to every gentle
                man who works for the State of Indiana.</p>

              <p>Mr. DITTEMORE moved to lay the motion of Mr. Glessner (to recommit) together with

            <p> The House reassembled at 2 P. M. andMr. MELLETT'S bill [H. R. 55,] to amend the act
              to provide for a general system of common schools, &amp;c., the special order for that
              hour was taken up and read the second time.</p>
            <p>The amendments relate to the appointment of County Superintendents of Schools, to be
              appointed by the County Commissioners at the June session in 1874, and triennialiy
              thereafter, such Superintendents to have the general management of the schools in
              their respective counties. The compensaton is fixed at $5 a day when actually
              employed, but the County Commissioners may limit the number of days each year he shall
              be employed, provided such number shall not be less than 150. The bill prescribes in
              detail his duties, and those of other officers in relation to his office.</p>
            <p>The Committee amendment reported at the morning session exempting city schools from
              the superintendence of such Superintendent at the request of the Board of Trustees of
              those schools&amp;c., was also read.</p>
            <p>Mr. MELLETT moved ineffectually that the House go into a committee of the whole to
              consider all the bills relating to the subject of education.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the House proceeded to consider Bill No. 55, section by
              section, and the first section was read.</p>
            <p>The SPEAKER suggested that this mode of procedure would encumber the record with
              useless and unnecessary matter.</p>
            <p>Mr. RICHARDSON then moved that the House go into a committee of the whole on Bill No.
              55 alone, which motion now prevailed, and the Speaker called Mr. Peed to the
              chair.</p>
            <p>The first section was re-read. It provides for the appointment as above stated of a
              County superintendent of Schools, who shall be a resident of the county.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY moved to amend so as to require him to execute a bond with a freehold
              security in the penal sum of $4,000, for the faithful performance of his duty and to
              account for all money that may come into his hands.</p>
            <p>Mr. MILLER thought there was no occasion for this as the bill did not authorize the
              Superintendent to receive or hold any pnblic money.</p>
            <p>Mr. JOHNSON concurred in this view. The sixth and seventh sections of the bill
              require him to institue suit in the name of the State for the recovery of fines,
              forfeitures, unclaimed fees, liquor license, surplus dog tax &amp;c., when the proper
              officers have failed to collect or pay over the same, but the money, when collected,
              should be paid over to the County Treasurer. </p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY dissented. As he <pb n="388" xml:id="VAA8558-14-388"/> was required to
              institute the suits, and as the bill did not provide that by whom the money should be
              received, the Superintendent would undoubtedly be authorized to receipt for the
              judgement.</p>
            <p>Mr. GIVAN said the law provided these fines, fees, &amp;c., should belong to the
              school fund. He imagined that any suits instituted under this section would be
              commenced on the relation of the officer to whom the custody of that fund belongs, and
              not of the Superintendent.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCHMUCK thought a bond should be required from the Superintendent whether he is
              made the custodian of public funds or not. His duties are sufficiently important to
              require that he should give a bond.</p>
            <p>Mr. LENFESTY did not think that a bond was required under sections 6 and 7. But
              section 8 makes him a member of the Board of (School Trustees, and as these officers
              are now required to give bonds, he thought the Superintendent should be subject to the
              same requirement.</p>
            <p>The amendment was adopted.</p>
            <p>Mr. THAYER moved to further amend the first section so as to provide that the
              Superintendent shall be elected by the qualified voters instead of appointed by the
              County Commissioners and hold his office for four years instead of three. He said his
              observation had taught him that it was much easier to manipulate a small board than
              the whole people. Besides that, the County Commissioners might not be the best judges
              of the competency of the appointee. Ordinarily, a man who is able to manage an 80 acre
              farm is regarded as competent to discharge the duties of County Commissioner, and he
              may not be a man of education or qualified to decide on the competence cf the
              Superintendent.</p>
            <p>Mr. COWGILL was opposed to the amendment. A position like this should seek the man,
              and not the man the office. He was opposed to throwing this important office out to be
              scrambled for at a popular election, for which probably not the best men would
              struggle. He thought it would be safer and they would be likely to secure better
              Superintendents by leaving the appointment in the hands of the County
              Commissioners.</p>
            <p>Mr. HELLER, under a missapprehension of the question, took exceptions to the seventh
              section, and offered an amendment thereto, but subsequently withdrew it.</p>
            <p>Mr. COBB spoke in favor of the pending amendment. If any thing of this kind is to be
              inflicted upon the people of the State, if we have got to provide a place in each
              county for some young attorney who has rendered his party distinguished service, but
              has not acquired a practice sufficient to support him, or else some played-out
              professor who can't make a living in his legitimate profession, let us allow the
              people of those counties to say who shall be placed in the position,-whom they will
              pension in this way.</p>
            <p>Mr. KIMBALL said he believed it was the object of this Legislature to do as much good
              as possible. The educational interests of the State require attention at our hands,
              and what we do should result in the greatest good to the people. If we undertake to
              make offices for purpose of furnishing the means for electioneering schemes for
              politicians we fail in the object for which we were sent here. He was opposed even to
              the election of the State Superintendent. He thought he ought to be appointed. The
              appointing power would feel the responsibility resting on his shoulders and be careful
              to select a good and competent man. If we make the office elective it will be sought
              by men who want office for the sake of office, whether they are competent or not. Then
              questions of religion, of politics and various others will arise, aid the result will
              be the election of incompetent men. He would be in favor of the appointment of the
              Superintendent by the Circuit Court Judge, or even some higher power. Still the County
              Commissioners would feel the the responsibility of the appointment and be careful in
              their action. He hoped this idea of pandering to popular favor for buncombe would be
              done away with by this Legislature, and he would take the responsibility of saying
              that the people are trusted too much with these things, because the legislators want
              to be rid of the responsibility. He hoped the amendment would be voted down.</p>
            <p>Mr. MELLETT said there was another objection to the amendment. Section five provides
              a standard of qualification in the Superintendent, bat if this is made an elective
              office, this important feature will be lost.</p>
            <p>The vote being taken on the the amendment, it was rejected.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLSON, of Ripley, moved to amend the section so as to provide for the
              appointment of the Superintendent by the Trustees of the different townships in each
              county. This, he said, would bring the matter nearer to the people. The men appointed
              by the County Commissioners are generally bobtailed politicians who have done
              something for the Commissioners or their friends. </p>
            <pb n="389" xml:id="VAA8558-14-389"/>
            <p>Mr. COWGILL thought the same objections would obtain against an appointment by the
              Township Trustees as by the County Commissioners. It would be just as probable that
              they would make it a political matter.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLSON'S amendment was rejected.</p>
            <p>Mr. RICHARDSON moved to amend the section so as to prohibit the Superintendent from
              acting as agent for the sale of any text or book or school furniture.</p>
            <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
            <p>Section 1 was then adopted as amended, and Section 2 was read, which prohibits the
              Superintendent from issuing a certificate to any teacher except upon a public
              examination.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLSON, of Ripley, moved to strike out the second section.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN thought the bill was either all right or all wrong. It was dangerous to
              attempt to patch up the bill in this manner. If the section is struck out the bill
              will be shorn of much of its force.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLSON thought it would be productive of great inconvenience. Suppose a young
              lady wants to teach school, and has been chosen by the people, she must post off
              perhaps twenty or thirty miles, and undergo a public examination at the county sear,
              lie thought this sort of dress parnde unnecessary.</p>
            <p>The motion was rejected.</p>
            <p>Mr. DIAL moved to amend the section by striking out the words, "And in no case shall
              he grant a license upon a private examination."</p>
            <p>Mr. GREGORY said the system of private examinations was not only harassing to the
              Examiner, but afforded an opportunity for favoritism and laxity. The examinations will
              be much more thorough where thoy are held before the eye of the public.</p>
            <p>The amendment was lost and the section was adopted as a whole.</p>
            <p>When section 3 was read a difficulty arose. The Clerk read from the original
              manuscript copy of the bill, while members had been furnished with printed copies in
              which some amendments recommended by the Committee on Education and accepted by the
              House had been inserted.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLSON, of Ripley, moved that the committee rise and report to the House,
              recommending the indefinite postponement of the bill. The motion was rejected.</p>
            <p>The amendment reported from the <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName> at the
              morning session exempting city schools whose Board have employed a superintendent,
              from the general superintendence of the county superintendent was adopted.</p>
            <p>The difficulty which arose when Section 3 was read again arose on the reading of
              Section 4, and after a little inharmonious dispute, the committee rose and reported
              progress, and the bill was recommited to the committee, to be made the special order
              for to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock.</p>
            <p>Mr. MELLETT'S bill [H. R. 261,] was then taken up. It proposes to amend the existing
              law, so as to provide that there shall be annually assessed and collected as State and
              county revenues 20 cents on each hundred dollars of real and personal property, and 50
              cents on each taxable poll, to be expended for tuition purposes alone. The bill was
              read the third time when - </p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM said he hoped the bill would not pass. The Superintendent of Public
              Instruction in his report suggests three methods by which we can secure funds enough
              to keep the schools open at least six months in the year. First, a revision of the
              assessment laws, which has already been done. Second, an additional levy. Third, to
              compel the local townships to assess the local tax up to the limit now allowed by law.
              He submitted whether it was right now to make an additional levy of four cents on a
              hundred dollars, when, according to all reasonable calculations, the revision of the
              assessment laws will produce all the money required to keep the schools open that
              length of time. Some people suppose the common schools are the only thing in the
              State. He differed from them. He was willing to raise a sufficient amount of money to
              keep all the schools in the State open six months in a year. A large proportion of
              them are kept open ten months, and in rural districts six months is all that children
              can be taught with advantage. He would admit that the property of the State should
              bear its fair proportion of the burden, but with the assessments on the property of
              the State without reference to where it is collected, with the inequality with which
              it burdens certain counties and the benefits that it confers on others, he asked if it
              was not right that those localities that ask aid of the State at large should do their
              full share towards keeping up their own schools. If we do not compel these local
              districts to bear part of the burdens, on what principle do we pile it on the other
              counties? Money raised in these localities does not leave the neighborhood, being
              spent at home, while money that is taken from these counties and sent to other
              counties is lost to them forever. More than that, expenditures are pressing, TheState
              Normal School and universities <pb n="390" xml:id="VAA8558-14-390"/> and colleges, and
              the benevolent institutions, are calling for money. We must have a new State House,
              which it is said must not cost less than three or four millions. The great want of
              this State is cheaper money to develop the material wealth, and just so long as we
              feel deposed to recklessly burden this property just so long we erect a barrier
              against its coming in. He knew, of his own knowledge, of several million dollars that
              are going to leave the State because of the unjust burdens heaped upon it. In
              accomplishing too much in one direction we lose in another. He hoped the bill would
              not pass.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY said compelling these townships to bear this expense, would load the poor
              with burdens which they are unable to bear, and relieve the rich from burdens which
              they ought to bear. If Indiana would not vote to increase the tax four cents and feed
              the School system so that it shall become what it ought to be, he was in favor of
              striking down the whole system. He thought the system ought to be made so strong and
              perfect that it will afford a good education to every child in the State.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLSON, of Ripley, moved to lay the bill on the table, </p>
            <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas 44, nays 43.Mr. JONES' bill [H. R. 316,] a part of
              the special order, was next taken up, and the House went into a committee of the
              whole, Mr. Peed in the chair.</p>
            <p>The bill authorizes the levy of additional taxes, not to exceed in all 25 cents on
              the hundred dollars in one year, to pay off debts incurred in the construction and
              repair of school houses, the levy to be made every year until the debts are
              liquidated.</p>
            <p>Mr. RICHARDSON moved that the committee rise and report the bill back to the House,
              with a recommendation that it lie on tha table.</p>
            <p>The motion was agreed to. The report was made accordingly and concurred in by the
              House.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN'S bill [H. R. 410] was then taken up and the House went into committee
              again, Mr. Woollen in the Chair. The bill provides that Trustees of townships, towns
              and cities shall levy a tax, not to exceed 25 cents on the hundred dollars, and 25
              cents on each poll, until the amount collected, in additional to the revenue from
              other sources, shall be sufficient to mantain the schools for at least six months in
              the year &amp;c.-,see page 96.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY said this bill came right down to compelling townships to do what he said
              the State ought to do, to compell them, without reference to their ability to tax
              themselves to do that which they are unable to do, and which is the duty of the State
              to do. It is the effort on the part of the rich to crush the poor.</p>
            <p>Mr. KIMBALL denied that proposition. He said it was an effort to compel the poor to
              educate their children an effort of those who represent the interests of the people to
              compel those to pay a tax they will not pay unless compelled by law. There are many
              who will not pay any tax for school purposes unless compelled by this law. What good
              reason has the gentleman for putting additional burdens on the rich in order to
              educate the poorer classes. The speaker lived in a township where probably they have
              as many poor people as he has in Morgan county, and yet, as citizens of that township,
              they were perfectly willing that the trustees should levy a tax to educate their poor.
              He was tired of hearing so much said about the poor. He was as willing as any other
              gentleman on the floor to educate the poor, but let every township, as far as it can,
              take care of its own poor. We have been liberal as a State in levying 16 cents for the
              tuition of poor people and all the people of the State. We have been still more
              liberal by concentrating all the surplus funds into one fund for the education of the
              people of the State, Last year the levy for tuition was $2,100,000. Since this
              Legislature has been in session we have added to that school fund, and the last
              session of the Legislature distributed the Sinking Fund for the purpose of common
              school education. And it seems to me that when the gentleman from Morgan and Johnson
              gets on this floor and charges this Legislature or any part of it, with a desire to
              grind the poor man down with taxation in order to compel him to educate his children,
              he is stating that which he can not prove. If a man is poor how much tax does he pay?
              If he has nothing to be taxed he is not very heavily burdend with taxation. Under the
              old levy, Marion county paid nearly $25,000 into the common school fund of the State
              for the education of children of other counties, and under the new assessment law we
              will add probably a million more to the taxable list of the State. If you Increase the
              levy to twenty cents you increase the burden of these counties. Marion county can
              point to the monuments of her liberality for the education of the poor. Every child
              should bo educated, and not let him grow up to manhood unable to read his Bible or the
              laws that you pass to govern <pb n="391" xml:id="VAA8558-14-391"/> him, and unable to
              do anything in business. Educate him, enable him to do something that will add to the
              revenue of the State and the improvement of society and the advancement of the arts
              and sciences. Whenever you take that step forward, then the State will take the
              certain step to prosperity, and every child in our glorious State will be enabled to
              read the Word of God and contribute intelligently his proportion to the commonwealth -
              its wealth and its honor.</p>
            <p>Mr. RENO said that was the very reason he wanted the other bill to pass. This bill is
              putting a burden on the people where they are not able to hear it. It is just as hard
              for a man who is worth only $1,000 to pay his 16 per cent, as it is for a man worth
              $10,000.</p>
            <p>Mr. BUTTS voted against the former bill because he knew this bill was coming up, and
              it suited him. He believed these counties did not improve the money given them by
              other counties. But when a man knows that he is paying money out of his own pocket for
              the education of his children he will send his children to school day after day when
              otherwise they would stay at home.</p>
            <p>Mr. BILLINGSLEY said there was one more point. In many rural districts the districts
              are divided and subdivided and the schools rendered inefficient. If they had to
              provide the money out of their own pockets they would cast about them to see where
              they could consolidate and improve their schools.</p>
            <p>Mr. KIMBALL now moved that the committee rise and report the bill back to the House
              and recommend its passage.</p>
            <p>The motion was agreed to, the committee rose and reported accordingly, and the House
              concurred in the report. The bill was then read the third time and put on its
              passage.</p>
            <p>Mr. RICHARDSON moved a call of the House, which was not sustained by a majority of
              members pressent.</p>
            <p>He then moved to adjourn, which was rejected.</p>
            <p>Mr. GIVAN moved to lay the bill on the table.</p>
            <p>This motion was also rejected, yeas 34, nays 51.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM said several years ago 25 cents on the $100 was fixed as the limit which
              townships might levy for the support ot schools; 12 cents was the amount that the
              State should afford outside of the interest on common school fund. Afterwards it was
              advanced to 16 cents on the levy for State purposes with the supposition that Township
              Trustees would levy up to the limit to maintain the schools, which they have failed to
              do. This bill simply provides that this additional levy shall only be made where it is
              necessary to provide the means to keep the schools open six months in a year. He was
              in favor of making them do their duty.</p>
            <p>The question was then taken on the passage of the bill, and resulted as follows:</p>

            <p> Mr. SCOTT'S bill [S. 95,] to prevent the fouling of streams (by slaughter houses,
              etc.,) from which water is taken for use of cities or towns, which was under
              consideration at the adjournment last night, was taken up - the question being upon
              the amendment of Mr. Glessner as modified by Mr. Dwiggins to wit: so as to provide
              that no penalty shall attach unless the water-works are erected above the limits of
              the city: and that the bill shall not apply to the owners of pork-houses,
              manufactories, etc., heretofore erected.</p>
            <p>Mr. HARNEY contended that the pollusion of streams was a necessary incident of the
              growth of cities, and contended that public policy was opposed to such wholesale
              destruction of the rights of property as the bill contemplated. This question requires
              more careful consideration than can be given to it by the Legislature at the present
              time. In the city of Indianapolis it might be a question whether the city's supply of
              water shall be kept pure, or whether it is better to banish the factories using that
              stream as a sewer, or remove the water works above the city. This matter will develope
              itself hereafter into a great question, and even now it is worthy the gravest
              consideration. And it seems to me this question is one that should be adjudicated by
              the Courts. The soot from hundreds of smoke stacks in the cities blackens the snow on
              the streets, and all cities have drains that bear their refuse into streams, which
              makes them unwholesome. This city could not exist if it would not empty its sewers
              into a stream somewhere. It is a fact we must admit that we cannot preserve the water
              of streams pure and the air pure and at the same time congregate large masses of
              people in one place and carry on manufactories on a large scale. Great cities are
              watered by measures reaching beyond such effects. New York conveys water thirty or
              forty miles, and Boston had to acquire a primary right before it could get water.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. It may be possible that this bill will need some amendments, but it is not
              that terrible monster the Senator would have us believe. As yet I do not know where
              all these factories and great public improvements are that he talks about; if there
              are any along this river here, I have never heard of them to any great extent. The
              idea that a woolen factory or a pork house must of necessity occupy white river so as
              to destroy its waters is utterly preposterous as a question of necessity or fact. It
              is only a matter of tolerance and does not <pb n="393" xml:id="VAA8558-14-393"/>
              militate against that principle of common law that a person using the waters of a
              stream above shall not use them so as to destroy them for the use of his neighbor
              below. Science is preparing itself to consume and utilize that smoke the Senator
              speaks of. It is only a question of time, sir; and if it must be used it should be put
              up so high in the atmosphere that it will not injure the health of people in the
              neighborhood, but because we allow smoke to escape in the air is no reason why we
              should allow our streams to be poisoned. There has been a law on our statute books as
              long as I can remember prohibiting persons from contaminating streams by throwing
              refuse in them. A man cannot obtain a prescriptive right - the statute and the law are
              in advance of him - and because people have erected pork-houses on the banks of a
              stream it does not give them the right to foul it. About a month ago I was on the
              banks of this river about fifteen minutes and I think I saw five wagon loads of refuse
              from the pork-house, I suppose, emptied into the river right where the waiter works
              are that supply this city with water. Will the Senator say that is a matter of
              necessity? that it is a matter of right of presumptive right? that the men owning
              pork-houses have the right to enjoy that privlege? If the Senator had a dead cow and
              should throw her into the stream he would have to answer for the crime before the law;
              and what is the difference? Now, sir, while these things are in their infancy it is
              time they should be checked. Where a great city like this is permitted to take water
              from a stream for the inhabitants, they should be protected from impurities being cast
              into the stream. I think probably the number of miles above the stream named in this
              bill is too high; I think five miles is little enough. I think the stream would purify
              itself in that distance, I don't think the Senator has thought enough about that bill.
              I would like to move that this bill be referred back to the Committee with
              instructions to shorten the distance. Let it go to the <orgName>Committee on Rights
                and Privileges</orgName>.</p>
            <p>Mr. GLESSNER. Let it be referred without instructions.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. I have no objections, I wan't to get it right, that's all I want.</p>
            <p>The motion was agreed to, and so the bill was referred without instructions, to the
                <orgName>Committee on Rights and Privileges</orgName>.</p>

            <head rend="center">[Afternoon Session.]</head>
            <p>Mr. TAYLOR'S bill [S. 105,] to authorize the Courts of Common Pleas to determine the
              heirs of legatees, who distributees of a decendent are, and to order partial
              distribution of his estate among such heirs, distributees, or legatees, prior to the
              final settlement, declaring an emergency, being read the second time - </p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN moved to strike out the emergency clause, holding that the constitution
              required the character of the emergency to be stated, in order to make the emergency
              clause effective. He called attention to the constitutional provision referred to and
              made the motion to strike out in order to give opportunity for discussion.Mr. TAYLOR
              stated the emergency in in this case; a gentleman died some two years ago leaving a
              large estate in money which cannot be distributed from the fact that the heirs are
              non-residents - indeed it is hardly known who they are.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE. I understand the motion to be to strike out a part of the body of the
              bill, because an emergency clause is a part of a bill. What is the body of a bill?
              what forms a bill It is sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on ; and if section four contains
              the emergency clause it is in the body of the bill, and in conformity with the
              constitution of the State. I understand that the Senate acts upon and determines,
              before they place it in the body of the bill, that such an emergency exists. So it is
              placed there under the constitution, and for a purpose the framer's of the
              constitution deemed proper, therefore it is part of the bill. You must have the
              emergency clause in the body of the bill, and the body of the bill would be whatever
              was between the preamble and the emergency clause and nowhere else as the gentleman
              argues. I understand an emergency clause is one of the sections of a bill. If the
              Legislature thinks there is no necessity for an emergency they will not enact the law.
              If they think that there is an emergency and it is required, in that case they put it
              in the bill. Then I cannot see the force of the gentleman's constitutional objection
              to the emergency clause.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. The Senator from Grant [Mr. Steele] has not comprehended the point I made.
              I am a friend to this bill and a friend to a valid constitutional emergency clause,
              not a clause that is void. The section of the Constitution I refer to is this: "No act
              shall take effect until the same shall have been published and circulated in the
              several counties of this State, by authority, <pb n="394" xml:id="VAA8558-14-394"/>
              except in case of emergency; which emergency shall be declared in the preamble, or in
              the body of the law."-Sec. 28, Art. IV. This clause has special reference to the time
              when the acts shall take effect. It is well known that every act which has no
              emergency clause does not take effect until the laws are published in every county.
              All laws which have an emergency clause go into effect upon their passage. The next
              thing is what should an emergency clause contain? What is an emergency? The emergency
              is the reason why the law should go into effect on the passage of the law.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE. I would ask if the Supreme Court have not already passed upon just such
              bills and decided that an emergency clause as in this bill is good and legal?</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. I don't know. The point I make is this: That the reason why the law should
              go into effect upon its passage, and not upon the filing of the laws in the counties
              as the other laws, should be stated in the clause of the bill professing to be the
              emergency clause.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. Suppose after we found there was an emergency it should turn out that
              there was no emergency. What would be the effect?</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. The cause for an emergency belongs entirely to the Legislature of the
              State, and it cannot be reviewed.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. Isn't it just as well to put our judgment forth on the reason?</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. If the Constitution said so.</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence. I would like to ask whether the Constitution provides that
              the Legislature shall set out in the bill the reason of an emergency or the cause for
              an emergency, or whether it directs that the Legislature shall declare there is an
              emergency?</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. I amswer by reading from the Constitution these words: "which emergency
              shall be declared in the preamble or in the body of the law." What is an
              emergency?</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence. The emergency is one thing and the cause of that emergency
              another.Mr. BROWN. What is an emergency?</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence. That depends upon circumstances. Certain reasons would
              create an emergency in one case at hat would not in another. It is not necessary that
              we should set out the reasons or cause that creates an emergency, it is enough to
              declare that there is an emergency.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. What is an emergency?</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence. It is not the cause of an emergency.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. The Constitution says the emergency must be declared either in the body or
              preamble of the bill. Is saying "whereas an emergency exists therefore this act shall
              take effect immediately on its passage," reciting that an emergency exists? Of course
              it does not. A declaration of emergency is setting out the reason in the body of the
              bill or the preamble, why the law should take effect immediately. For instance, if
              there is no law on the subject then It would be proper to say "whereas there if no law
              upon the subject contained in the body of this bill, therefore an emergency exists for
              the immediate taking effect of this act." Then, why does an emergency exist? Because
              there is no law on that subject. There the emergency is stated in the body of the act,
              and the constitutional provision is complied with. But it is not complied with when it
              is simply said there is an emergency, without stating what the emergency is. Why is it
              that an act should go into effect now and not wait the general course of the taking
              effect of the other acts? Whatever cause there is for the immediate taking effect of
              this act is an emergency, and that should be stated in the emergency clause. If there
              is no existing law upon the subject that perhaps is a reason why it should go into
              effect at once and that should be stated as the emergency requiring the immediate
              taking effect of the act. The Constitution says: "Which emergency shall be declared in
              the preamble or in the body of the law." It cannot be got around. It may not
              invalidate the law, but whether the emergency is a valid one or an invalid one I
              suppose the courts can review.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS moved to lay Mr. Brown's motion upon the table, whereupon Mr. Brown
              withdrew his motion.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS moved to amend the bill by providing that where the parties interested
              are residents of the county they may be served with personal notice instead of by
              advertisement. The amendment was adopted, and the bill ordered to be engrossed.</p>

          <p> The SPEAKER. The hour having arrived for the special order, the House will take up the
            bill (Mr. Mellett's committee bill, H. R. 55) to amend sections 33, 37, 39, and 43 of
            the Common School act of March 6. 1865, and adding supplemental sections thereto - the
            question being on the third reading.</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT. I wish to correct the bill conformably to some amendments which were
            yesterday recommended by the Committee of the Whole and concurred in by the House, such
            as these : The County Superintendent shall be a citizen of the county - subscribe to an
            oath - execute a bond in the penal sum of $4,000 - report as to all school money that
            may come into his hands, etc.,shall hold at least one public examination in each month
            for teachers - shall not grant license on private examination - all licenses limited to
            the county in which they are granted - shall have general superintendence of the schools
            of his county - visit each Township Institute and each school in the county at least
            once in each year - encourage Institutes, advocate the standard of teaching, etc.in all
            legal school controversies his opinion to be sought - thence an appeal in writing to the
            State Superintendent - shall carry out the instructions of the State Board of Education
            and constitute a medium between the State Superintendent and the subordinate school
            officers,cities excepted, etc. I desire that the vote of yesterday by which the bill was
            ordered to be engrossed should be reconsidered, for the purpose of referring the bill
            again to the Committee on the Whole. I am satisfied that the Committee on Education
            desire this bill to be passed, and I make this motion for the purpose of getting it
            intelligently before the House.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRETT submitted a motion [ineffectually] to lay the subject on the table, yeas 40,
            nays 50.</p>
          <p>The motion to reconsider was then agreed to, and the bill was again referred to the
              <orgName>Committee of the Whole House</orgName>. - Mr. Lenfesty in the chair.</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT. I think it best to have the bill, as amended, read by sections, so that
            the whole matter may come before the Committee intelligently.</p>
          <p>The CHAIRMAN. What is the pleasure of the Committee as to the bill No. 55?</p>
          <p>Mr. BILLINGSLEY. I move that we consider it section by section; but on the motion of
            Mr. HATCH, the Committee determined first to take up section 4, and it was read by the
            Clerk. It provides that the County Superintendent shall receive not less than $3 nor
            more than $10 for each day employed in the discharge of his duties.</p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. BILLINGSLEY this was fixed at $4 a day.</p>
          <pb n="396" xml:id="VAA8558-14-396"/>
          <p>Mr. GIVAN. I move to strike out these words: 'Provided the number of days so allowed in
            each year for visiting shall not be less than the whole number of schools in each
            county.' It is superfluous to give the County Commissioners power to fix the number of
            days, and then say the Superintendent shall visit every school. It seems to me better to
            give the discretion wholly to the Commissioners. They should call on him to visit the
            schools if they desire him to do so; but perhaps there might be no necessity for it.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. The object of this provision is, that some person shall be authorized to
            give his immediate attention to the interests of the schools ; and whilst the section
            limits the number of days, it also limits the discretion - so that the number of days
            shall not be less than the number of schools in the county. The House should recollect
            that the Board of Commissioners may justly consider that anything coming before them
            should be put down as a part of their duty, which would not be so here if this were left
            to their discretion. They might forget or fix it so that the Superintendent could not
            visit the schools at all. - Sir, this one of the provisions of the bill that should be
            retained : because it is essential to save the County Superintendent from total
            annihilation, if the Commissioners should be looking only to the saving of expenses.</p>
          <p>Mr. GIVAN. The County Superintendent has no control of the city schools---yet he is
            here entitled to pay for visiting every school in the countythose, as well, over which
            he has no control.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. We provide that the number of days in which he shall visit the schools
            shall not be less than the number of the schoolsone day to be given by the
            Superintendent to each school---not less than that. However,the suggestion of the
            gentleman from Dearborn (Mr. Givan) might be a good one in the shape of an
            amendment---if the bill should be modified so as to exclude the Superintendent from
            visiting the city schools; yet I do not see any reason for excluding him from visiting
            the city schools. I am sure it would be a very considerable benefit to the
            Superintendant himself.</p>
          <p>Mr. RUMSEY. This is a matter of too much importance to be lightly disturbed. The
            gentleman from Johnson (Mr. Woollen) alleged the other day in good terms, that all the
            children of the State are to be affected by this action for good or for evil. Sir, I
            have had some little experience in the school business for the past 28 years. I have
            taught in town and country ; and I believe that if this bill is passed it will elevate
            the country schools. Gentlemen have alluded to the log school houses as a hobby, which
            they say is brought into this House. Well, if it be a hobby, I am willing to ride it,
            for I am greatly indebted to the log school houses, and the energy of the fathers that
            built them. This amendment I consider as directed against the country schools. It was
            the tendency of the argument yesterday, that, having already the high schools in
            successful operation in the cities, we ought to work for the country; and that also is
            my argument. We want the country schools elevated. Why, sir, we have 900 districts
            virtually with schools in this State. Then let these Superintendents attend the
            institutes and the city schools, and hear what is taught and how ; so that he may be
            qualified to do better than a certain examiner in my mind, whose question to the pupil
            was this: "What is the first lesson in primary Geography?" And when that examiner asked
            me how I would examine the pupil, I answered, that I would give him the map of North
            America and say to him: How would you prove that the world is round?</p>
          <p>Mr. OFFUTT [interposing.] Did that occur in Tipton county?</p>
          <p>Mr. RUMSEY. It occurred in Tipton county, and I have no doubt that it is as bad in
            Hancock county. [Laughter.]</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. Gentlemen ought to keep cool.</p>
          <p>Mr. RUMSEY. I say that this amendment will strike down the county examiner.</p>
          <p>Mr. GIVAN. I would call the attention of the Committee to the 3d section, which
            provides that the Superintendant shall visit each school in the county once in each
            year. The object I have in view is to admit of the number of days being less than the
            number of the schools. He might visit half a dozen schools in one day.</p>
          <p>Mr. RUMSEY. That has been answered. The County Commissioners might cut down the number
            of the days so that the Superintendent could not get round, because they would not allow
            him the per diem. I am in favor of the section as it stands.</p>
          <p>Mr. SMITH. It seems to me that if this amendment is adopted it will cut off the power
            of the Superintendent. It would render the office of much less value than the Examiners
            office is now. It would destroy the bill.</p>
          <p>Mr. CLARK proposed to amend the amendment, adding: "Provided the number of days allowed
            in each year for visiting the schools shall not be less than the whole number of schools
            over which the Superintendent shall have control."</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT. I submit a substitute for these. Insert in the 5th line: "He shall receive
            no compensation except as provided herein."I am glad this discussion has come up. The
            objections which have been urged are just, and can very easily be reme- <pb n="397"
              xml:id="VAA8558-14-397"/> died. I am aware that it will increase the expenses of the
            common schools; but, with this amendment, I believe it will make the office of
            Superintendent what it ought to be. The law at present allows the County Examiner $3 a
            day for his services. It makes no provision whatever about his perqusites ; and the
            County Examiners are not perfect. There is a system of fraud and corruption that has
            grown up out of the Examiners office which has been presented to the Committee on
            Education, by which the office is somanaged that, while the County Commissioners under
            the present law give them each $3 a day, and they actually average some five dollars or
            more per day. They charge three dollars a day for visiting the schools, then they go
            before the Commissioners for expenses incurred in visiting the schools - the hire of
            horse and buggy - their hotel expenses, etc. And there is one County Examiner in the
            State drawing upwards of $1300 a year for his salary - staying in his office the whole
            time and practicing his profession besides. We want an officer whose duty it shall be to
            visit the schools, and not draw pay constructively. He should ask questions concerning
            all local schools, and matters connected with them, as do the city Superintendents. I
            say again, that there is more than one county in which the Examiner draws pay for every
            day in the year except Sunday.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRETT. Will the gentleman name some of those counties?</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT. There is a gentleman in my eye who will allow me to say he is my
            authority.</p>
          <p>Mr. JONES. The allusion is to Madison county.</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT. In the first place, three dollars a day is not enough for this officer to
            authorize him to take his horse and go out and visit the schools. Four dollars a day
            will be better. It gives a standard; and if nobody will accept the office there will be
            no harm done. But because the compensation is too low fraud has sprung up. You must
            allow to every man a just compensation for the service to be performed, and then you
            will get honest service; and God knows there in no department in which we need good
            service more than in the common schools How much do we pay for common schools? More than
            two millions are annually drawn out of the pockets of the people for school purposes;
            and will you have schools anc hchool houses, at such a cost, with no man to know or care
            whether this great publii work is well done or not? If you hire men to work the streets,
            you will place a man over them ; but here in your business of teaching the children of
            the State, you allow your men to go to the treasury andd raw their money with none to
            see whether they are doing their duty or not. You are leaving this to the people at
            large, and they disregard the work; they have something else to do; they are taking care
            of their homes and their business. I hope gentlemen will look after this interest
            intelligently, and be careful all the time (as I propose to be) to consider and vote for
            the benefit of the common schools. There are many teachers in the rural districts who
            are not qualified for their position, and you want some man to ferret them out. Now, it
            has been claimed that under this bill the teacher will draw his pay whether he does his
            duty or not. But section three requires the Superintendent to visit all the schools once
            in each year, and as much oftener as necessary to the usefulness of the schools. It is
            just as necessary that he should know the good teachers as the poor ones, to have them
            all to respect the law - to hold them to a stringent personal responsibility ; and this
            is not to prevent the Superintendent from visiting a half dozen in a day, if he wishes
            to do so. And the modifications in the fourth section leaves it just as in the other
            case. And then further: "He shall receive not less than $4 a day, and no compensation
            for expenses on any account except as herein provided." Does not that cut off
            perquisites? If not, then let us have something that will. You will stop all the leaks
            there, as it seems to me. Then in regard to the number of schools in the county. It has
            been urged that you should not allow him pay for visiting the city schools; and I agree
            to that. I will say, aye to that amendmentand does not this cut off all objection in a
            pecuniary point to the bill? It allows the Superintendent $4 per day - his account to be
            verified by his affidavit; he shall be allowed no constructive fees ; and he shall not
            be allowed for visiting the city schools, nor by construction for traveling or other
            expenses not herein enumerated. You provide him an office. You provide his duties. You
            provide his pay - and pay him for nothing else except the superintendance of the public
            schools.</p>
          <p>Mr. WILLSON, of Ripley. I do not want to be understood as being opposed to common
            schools. I heartily endorse everything that has been said in favor of common schools.
            But it is my right to get a just understanding of the present bill. This General
            Assembly can be easily imposed upon, if you simply appeal to the common sympathies of
            our nature, and so we might vote without knowing the provisions of the bill. This is a
            bill, which, as it seems to me, will not advance the interest of the common schools, for
            example: Take this 4th section, which provides that the County Superintendent shall have
            an office and $4 a day.</p>
          <pb n="398" xml:id="VAA8558-14-398"/>
          <p>He shall be allowed actual office expenses. But before the County Commissioners shall
            allow his account it shall be presented and verified by oath; and he shall not be
            allowed his per diem for visiting beyond the number of schools in his county. But then
            this Superintendent has to superintend and overlook the County Auditor and the justices
            of the peace of the county, and see that they perform their duty; so much has he to do,
            that it would be impossible for a man to discharge the duties of this office without
            occupying every one of the 365 days of the year. The object, it seems to me, is simply
            to make another office. We have now our county Examiners, and I have riot heard any
            complaint against them. Now, it seems to me that we ought to strike out that which
            authorizes this County Superintendent to be furnished with an office, and that his
            expenses shall be paid by the county ; for if we 1st that stand he has just as good a
            chance for perquisites as the County Clerk, and it will become an office to be sought
            after by all the small politicians of the county. Taking in all the perquisites it would
            count up perhaps to not less than $2,000 a year - and to do what? To do just what the
            Auditor, and the Grand Jury, and the justices of the peace of the county are now by law
            compelled to do, and what they are paid for doing! I say, sir, it is my candid belief,
            that this bill has been gotten up by parties already in office, and who want to increase
            their compensation. Do we suppose that the County Examiners will do their duty more
            carefully and efficiently under this bill than they do it now? I have before me what the
            law requires of the Examiners : Not exceeding 100 days in the year, and besides he is to
            examine the dockets of the justices of the peace. The law knows no part of a day. If ten
            minutes work is performed it must be paid for as one day. All this officer will have to
            do is to perform some little service every day and charge it. I say, that the children
            of the State are not to be benefited by this bill, but the politicians; and to get the
            place of the proposed Superintendent will become a matter of strife between office
            seekers. I am in favor of amending the bill in this particular, as to the offices, and 1
            am also in favor of providing that their per diem shall be in full for all expenses. I
            voted for the school bill which passed yesterday [Mr. Woollen's H. R. 410] because I
            thought it was right. I object to this - especially to the 4th in connection with the
            seventh section.</p>
          <p>Mr. COWGILL. I regard this matter of a County School Superintendent as important, but I
            have not yet heard an attempt on the part of the friends of this bill to reply to
            objections. I have listened to the objections of the gentleman from Ripley, but I do not
            find any material weight in them. It has been found necessary, sir, to have
            Supertendents of the schools in the cities and towns; and the office has worked well -
            as well as that of Roadmaster. It is always well enough to have some one to look after
            the "leaks." And if this has been found to be advantageous in our cities and towns, then
            the same system should be carried into the country; and the provisions of the bill are
            to make this matter a little more effective than the law is as it now stands. It is
            proposed to allow but a bare compensation for the discharge of these duties. I do not
            say that any wrong can grow up under it in any way. It is proposed by this amendment to
            cut off all constructive fees, and the Superintendent is to be paid a per diem for
            visiting every school in the county; - for as many days as there are schools - though he
            may visit half a dozen in a day. I hope the bill will pass with amendments as proposed
            to be modified by the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Mellett).Mr. JONES. The statement
            made by the gentleman from Delaware I received from a Mr. Metcalf, and it is stronger
            than the gentleman gave it - it was somewhere between $1200 and $1500 a year for the
            Examiner in our county.</p>
          <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH. In line five it is provided that he shall receive no compensation for
            expenses except as provided herein. I understand that all constructive charges are to be
            cut off.</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT'S substitute was adopted.</p>
          <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH proposed to amend further in section four by inserting in line seven
            after the word "account" these words: "Giving the date, specifying the character of the
            service and the length of time thereof." The object of this is to provide against the
            objection of the gentleman from Ripley.</p>
          <p>The amendment was adopted.</p>
          <p>Mr. KING proposed further to amend section four by striking out the words "not less
            than three nor more than ten."</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN suggested that, (while he was opposed to all these amendments), if the
            section was made to read not less than $4 a day he would be satisfied; but he would not
            leave it to the discretion of the Commissioners if they should desire to abolish the
            office by reducing the pay to 50 cents a day.</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT. While I believe that in nine tenths of the counties the pay would be $4
            per day, still there are some counties which are wealthy and able to bring better
            talents into the service of the schools than $4 a day would command. We do not limit the
            compensation which the cities may be willing to pay to their School Superintend- <pb
              n="399" xml:id="VAA8558-14-399"/> ents, and why deprive these counties of thes
            privileges which we accord to the cities. Some of the counties might want to pay more if
            it were left with the Commissioners and the people. I say then let them regulate it for
            themselves so as not to pay less than $4 a day, because that is as low as we can
            possibly procure the work which we desire.</p>
          <p>Mr. GIVAN proposed a substitute for the amendment of Mr. King : Striking out the words
            "not less than three nor more than ten," and inserting in lieu "not more than four."</p>
          <p>The substitute was adopted.</p>
          <p>Mr. WILLSON (of Ripley) proposed to amend by sriking out the first sentence in section
            four: "the County Superintendent shall have an office furnished him by the County
            Commissioners at the county seat."Mr. WOOLLEN. My friend from Ripley in opposed to the
            bill and wants to get that upon it which will carry it down; and I think his amendment
            would carry it down most effectually - to say that this Superintendent shall have
            neither a "local habitation nor a name."</p>
          <p>Mr. WILLSON of Ripley. The object of this bill is to make that office a good thing. Why
            should we furnish him with an office when he don't need it ?</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT. I should not now perhaps be surprised at any amendment that may be offered
            to this bill, since we understand now what this amendment means. The object is to make
            this Superintendent's office a responsible one - to specify his duties and oblige him to
            perform them. He is obliged to keep certain records - it is just as proper that he
            should have an office as any other county officer. But in everything that pertains to
            the jurisprudence and the courts - the judges, clerks, sheriffs, auditors, treasurers,
            and the recorders - the people must dance up and keep all these in fine offices - in
            everything that pertains to money the officer can have what he wants, but when it comes
            to the men having the care of the common schools there is no attention to be paid to
            them - nothing to be done for iheir convenience; and I wish I could say that this is not
            altogether the fault of the educators themselves, for they have not the faculty - the
            power to carry the needed legislation of the State which the lawyers can command. I wish
            they had.</p>
          <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH. How many days in the year would the Superintendent have to be in his
            office?</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT. I can't tell that.</p>
          <p>Mr. WILLSON of Ripley. The more I see of this bill the more I find that the entire
            object of it is to create a magnificent office.</p>
          <p>Mr. BARRETT. It does look a little singular to me to hear men say that they are friends
            of education and the common schools, and whenever a movement is made to better the
            condition of the schools, they are opposed to it. Now, we have perhaps the largest
            school fund of any State in the Union, and yet we are behind some of our neighboring
            States as to schools. We spend our two millions a year for the schools, and yet there is
            not a State in the Union where the schools are in a worse condition. There are 121,000
            inhabitants of the State over 10 years of age that can neither read nor write; and there
            are 30,000 voters dictating as to who shall make the laws for the people just in the
            same condition. Think of it! And yet gentlemen are offering everything that would better
            the condition of the schools. I look upon this bill, sir, as a move in the right
            direction. I am heartly in favor of it. I do not know what our County Examiner thinks of
            it, but I know he is a man, a friend of education, and that he visits all the schools in
            the county. I am willing to be taxed for it; and I do not inquire into the expense of
            this thing. The gentleman from Ripley has come out frankly and confessed that he is
            opposed to this bill; and yet he comes in with an amendment. I hope it will not prevail,
            for I would suspect him of anything else sooner than that he would offer a good
            amendment here. But if it were something in the interest of the lawyers the gentleman
            would doubtless support it. I want gentlemen on this floor to consider their duty to the
            children of the State.</p>
          <p>Mr. WILLSON of Ripley. How would it benefit the children to furnish an office for the
            County Superintendent?</p>
          <p>Mr. BARRETT. We would have a place for the examination.</p>
          <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH. Should he be always in his office?</p>
          <p>Mr. BARRETT. Always ; so that when a man wants a teacher or to be certified as one, he
            will not have to run all over town to find the Superintendent. As it is now, they have
            to run round to the store to find the School Examiner.</p>
          <p>Mr. COBB. Mr. Chairman, I did not propose to take any part in this debate. The Chairman
            of the <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName> has made an ingenious report; but he
            has made a very unkind thrust at those who differ from him as to the propriety of
            adopting this bill. Had it not been for that I should not take any part in this debate.
            As far as my county is concerned, we are in favor of education. We have secured good
            school houses, and care for them, so that when the children are not in them they are not
            occupied by the swine. Yet my people do not want this bill. And yet further---as far <pb
              n="400" xml:id="VAA8558-14-400"/> as the proposition of the gentleman from Ripley is
            concerned, I am opposed to that. We furnish our Examiner with an office, and he has an
            arm chair in it. And even if you pass this bill, though the School Examiner for us now
            may be changed, he will not discharge his duties any better,and he is satisfied with his
            pay.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. Does he get as good pay as the man in Madison county?</p>
          <p>Mr. COBB. I do not know. He discharges his duties well; and this bill will only change
            the name of his office. He is a friend of mine, and I will expose the fact that he got
            his position for his political services. He is considerable of an educational man for
            our part of the State. I do not know whether he has a certificate of qualifications to
            teach school ; but I think he has the qualifications that would get for him a State
            certificate. This bill, sir, commences at the wrong end; it commences with the
            Superintendent - so far away from the people that it will never get to them. If we are
            going to create an officer whose duties should be discharged by the township trustees,
            then I would say, let us do it with becoming dignity, let us give the incumbent an
            office to go in to, and to invite his friends, and of course the counties will pay the
            expenses. A gentleman here says: why provide him with an office when he will not be in
            it? Because I think he will be in it - on rainy days,and if not inclined piously, he can
            keep open on Sundays. It will be a good place for somebody. If we are going to adopt
            this swindle, let us do it in good style. I am opposed to the amendment of the gentleman
            from Ripley.</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT. I want to answer an honest man frankly.</p>
          <p>Mr. HELLER, I object, he has been hurling his speeches in my ears until my head
            aches.</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT, In response to the gentleman from Ripley, I will ask him whether his
            present Examiner is Superintendent of the county or town?</p>
          <p>Mr. WILLSON. I do not know.</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT. Then I undertake to say that there is a wrong here; that the Examiner of
            his county is the Superintendent of public schools at his county seat. I have been so
            informed, and judging from the warmth which the gentleman manifests, and the blandness
            with which he pointed it yesterday, I would as soon think his County Examiner has a
            personal interest in this bill as his member on this floor.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I submit that the gentleman is out of order.</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT (continuing). An attempt has been made to ridicule this bill by the
            gentleman from Huntington (Mr. Cobb). This opposition comes from counties where they
            have never had an Examiner, or where they can reward men for political services with an
            office that implies no labor. If gentlemen see fit to pander to political feeling in
            this matter I shall hold them to it. But some gentlemen do not forget the public
            interest, and I belong there. I shall never forget the interest of the toiling masses,
            and no clique, no ring can ever divert me from that position. The gentleman says he came
            here pledged to a certain measure. - Thank God, I am not pledged to any measure. I shall
            vote my principles upon all subjects. It comes with a bad grace from any gentleman to
            charge another with personal motives who himself comes here pledged to a person. I do
            not crawl, I stand erect here, and shall vote for what I conceive to be the interest of
            the people. But he says: so far as that is concerned he would have kept his seat
            considerately if I had not attacked the legal profession. I care not whether he keeps
            his seat or takes the floor - as far as I am concerned, when he wants to keep his seat
            let him keep it, and when be wants to take the floor, let him take it [laughter]. I want
            to provide for the country schools in the State of Indiana. I care not about his
            officers. This bill was drawn by the State Superintendant of public Instruction, whose
            duty and heart are in this great interest, who is conversant with every township trustee
            in the State, who knows their wants, and who has the integrity and the ready and
            requisite intelligence to recommend here what is for the good of the people; and it is
            my pleasure to honor him for it, aside from all political considerations. Though I am as
            bitterly opposed to the democratic party as any member on this floor, if a democratic
            Superintendent takes the lead on this question I will join him and support him, because
            I believe it is the most important question that can come before the General Assembly.
            Let the gentleman oppose the bill from political considerations, as he likes. But he
            insinuated that I attacked the legal profession. I did no such thing. Such a thing
            should be far from me, because I believe the leading members of the legal profession
            here are in favor of this bill. I said they had the talent, the power of getting their
            measures through the Legislature, and I wished that the educators of the State had the.
            same power. If that is attacking the legal profession, let him make the most of it. So
            far as this amendment is concerned, I simply ask the House to use its own sound
            discretion. It may not be a material point whether the County Superintendent have an
            office furnished him. It was recommended by the State Superintendent. But if it costs
            too much money, strike it out. The people are <pb n="401" xml:id="VAA8558-14-401"/>
            sovereign, and their will is law with the party to which I belong. They have always
            stood foremost in action upon this principle. In Connecticut they have Township
            Superintendents; in Pennsylvania the same; and their school system is in advance of
            ours, as it is shown by our 125,000 illiterates.</p>
          <p>Mr. GIVAN. It seems to me that the temper of the House is getting to be such that
            debate had better be postponed.</p>
          <p>Mr. BLOCHER. I move that the House adjourn.</p>
          <p>Mr. CHAIRMAN. That motion is out of order in <orgName>Committee of the
            Whole</orgName>.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. I move that the Committee rise.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. I propose to amend the motion by adding these words: "and ask leave to set
            again at two o'clock this P. M."</p>
          <p>Mr. WILLSON of Ripley. I propose to amend the amendment so as as to make the motion
            this: that the Committee rise, report the bill to the House, and recommend its
            indefinite postponement.</p>
          <p>The CHAIRMAN. The amendment to the amendment is out of order.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN'S modification was then adopted; whereupon the Committee rose and - </p>
          <p>The CHAIRMAN reported progress, and asked and obtained leave to set again at two
            o'clock P. M.</p>

          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
            <p>According to previous order, the House again resolved itself into <orgName>Committee
                of the Whole</orgName> - Mr. Lenfesty in the Chair - and took up again the
              consideration of Mr. Mellett's bill [H. R. 55] to amend Sections 33, 37, 39, 43 of the
              Common School act of March 6, 1865, and adding supplemental sections thereto.</p>
            <p>Mr. COBB rose to a privilege question occasioned by the remarks of Mr. Mellett this
              morning, not that he wished to reply to the gentleman from Delaware, but he felt
              unwilling to let the matter go without explanation to the House. He said: The
              gentleman was calling in question something I said with reference to the Rail Road
              Bill in which I said I was pledged to vote in a certain way. I wish to explain what I
              meant by saying I was pledged. It was not necessary that I should make pledges to
              secure the nomination for the Legislature. My pledges were all voluntary - that I
              would support certain measures. One of them was that I would be in favor of
              restricting the Rail Road Companies. Another was, that I would be in favor of paying
              the Garrett bonds: and still further, that I would vote squareley with my party upon
              all political issues, and as between the interests of the people and of the cliques I
              would vote in favor of the interests of the people; and as far as the temperance
              question is concerned, I would vote for the most radical bill that could be got
              through the Legislature and executed by the people. I give these simply as my views,
              and I do not think it was dishonorable in me to make these pledges.I desire only to
              say to the House this further: that I got 24 votes more than there were Republican
              voters in my county.</p>
            <p>The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the adoption of the amendment, of the gentleman from
              Ripley, (Mr. Willson,) to strike out the words from the fourth section "The County
              Superintendent shall have an office furnished him at the County seat."</p>
            <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. I move that the fourth section be now adopted as a whole.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRETT. Several gentlemen here don't understand the question.</p>
            <p>The CHAIRMAN, the question is on the adoption of section four as a whole.</p>
            <p>The motion was rejected on a division affirmative 31, negative 37.</p>
            <p>The CHAIRMAN. I understand that the section is still open to amendment.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLSON, of Ripley, proposed now to amend the section by striking out these
              words: "He shall be allowed his actual office expenses," etc.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRETT. It seems to me that if the friends of this bill desire its passage they
              ought not to load it down with their office and office expenses. We know that the
              expense of keeping an office the year round is considerable; and if the office must be
              opened the Superintendent must be paid for every day in the year; and it is alleged
              that one of the objects of the bill is to enable the Superintendent to get pay for
              every day. - The question for us to consider is, whether it is necessary for such an
              office to be kept open every day, or whether it is necessary to have an office at all.
              I was an officer of my county for fifteen years, and I had the care of the school
              funds, and I gave them as much care as possible. I have seen the folly of wasting the
              school money unnecessarily in getting the pay to the teachers; because the object is
              to get as much pay as possible for the teachers, and if we do not get the money to the
              teachers we do not give satisfaction. I once drew up a petition asking the Legislature
              to abolish the provision for three Commissioners. I saw that the pay of the
              Commissioners was a waste of money. At that time these officers were paid out of the
              school fund <pb n="402" xml:id="VAA8558-14-402"/> now they are paid out of the County
              revenue. But it all comes out of the pockets of the people; and it makes but little
              difference whether it is from the right hand or left hand pocket. - There is no
              necessity in my mind for this Superintendent so great that there should be an office
              furnished for him, to be kept open the year round, with office fixtures, furniture and
              expenses. I think there is no necessity for any thing of the kind. Whenever he desires
              to hold a school meting of any kind there will be no difficulty about finding a place
              in the Court House.</p>
            <p>Mr THAYER proposed this modification ; that the salary of the County Superintendent
              in Counties of fifty thousand inhabitants and over shall be $1,500 ; in Counties of
              less than fifty thousand and more than thirty thousand inhabitants the salary shall be
              one thousand dollars; and in Counties of less than thirty thousand eight hundred
              dollars.</p>
            <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH. Mr. Speaker, I believe that it is in the interest of the friends of
              this bill that the motion of the gentleman from Ripley (Mr. Willson,) should prevail.
              I think that we can do very well without the office for the Superintendent, and I will
              move to reconsider the vote by which that motion was rejected.</p>
            <p>Mr. MELLETT. I am perfectly willing to accede to the suggestion of the gentleman on
              my left (Mr. Butterworth.) I consider it immaterial as to whether the office is
              furnished or not - the Superintendent can do as the examiner has done in that regard.
              What we want is Superintendence. In regard to the motion just made by the gentleman
              from Kosciusko (Mr. Thayer,) I am satisfied that it is impracticable. His figures are
              too high, there is not a teacher in the country getting eight hundred dollars, and
              that is the lowest allowance in his figures.</p>
            <p>Mr. THAYER. I am opposed to any pay per diem with perquisites.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN submitted the point of order that, as an amendment to the amendment
              pending, the proposition of the gentleman from Kosciusko (Mr. Thayer,) has no relation
              to the subject matter pending, and is out of order. It might be submitted as an
              amendment to the bill itself.</p>
            <p>Mr. THAYER. I think it is not out of order. The amendment cannot be perfected without
              it, according to my views, as to a fixed salary. We know very well what it is when we
              have a certain amount per diem, and the scale upon which it is regulated by County
              Commissioners.</p>
            <p>The CHAIRMAN. The point of order raised by the gentleman from Johnson (Mr. Woollen,)
              the Chair believer to be well taken - that the amendment might be offered to the main
              bill but not to the amendment.</p>
            <p>Mr. THAYER. Then I withdraw it.</p>
            <p>The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the adoption of the amendment proposed by the
              gentleman from Ripley (Mr. Willson.)</p>
            <p>Mr. BRETT submitted this amendment to the amendment: Strike out from section four
              these words "Shall have an office furnished him by the Board of County Commissioners
              at the county seat."</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLSON of Ripley. I am willing to accept that.</p>
            <p>Mr. FURNAS. As I understand it, the motion of the gentleman from Daviess (Mr. Brett)
              has been before the Committe once, and is therefore out of order.</p>
            <p>The CHAIRMAN. The chair is of the opinion that the point of order is well taken. The
              proper way to reach this matter would be by a reconsideration of the vote by which the
              amendment of the gentleman from Ripley was lost.</p>
            <p>On the motion of Mr. BILLINGSLEY, that vote was then reconsidered, and the question
              recurred again on striking out these words from the first sentence of section 4:
              "Shall have an office furnished him by the County Commissioners at the county
              seat."</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. As I understand the motion in its present shape is it to strike out all
              of the section which relates to an office and office expenses,</p>
            <p>The amendment was adopted.</p>
            <p>Mr. BARRETT. I now move the adoption of the section as amended.</p>
            <p>Mr. MELLETT. As I understand the section now, it is $4 per day, and no
              perquisites.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. I will ask leave to amend the motion by substituting this for the
              section: "Section 4. The County Superintendent shall keep an office at the county
              seat, and shall receive $4 per day for every day actually employed in the discharge of
              his duties under this act, his account to be presented and verified by affidavit, to
              the effect that the account is just and true. The County Auditor shall draw his
              warrant on the County Treasurer for the amount allowed by the County Board in favor of
              said Superintendent, and the Treasurer shall pay the said warrant out of the ordinary
              county revenue; provided the number of days so allowed in each year for visiting the
              schools shall not be less than the whole number of schools in such county." The
              substitute compels the Superintendent to have an office at the county seat, but at his
              own expense </p>
            <pb n="403" xml:id="VAA8558-14-403"/>
            <p>Mr. BRETT. It seems to me that the whole question of an office is upon us again. By
              this substitute you compel the Superintendent to keep an office; and it would be very
              unjust to compel him to keep an office and not compensate him for it.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. I hope gentlemen will not provide so that this officer shall have no
              office. [A laugh.]</p>
            <p>Mr. BRETT. Certainly - this question has been once settled that he shall have no
              office.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. It was not put so rediculously, that he shall have no office, but that
              the county shall not pay for it.</p>
            <p>Mr. HELLER. I conceive that this would cut out a certain class of men from holding
              this office. It might be desirable to put men into these places who are capable but
              poor, and unable to go to the county seat and keep an office. It would crowd out the
              poor man into the cold. The mere bookworm - impracticables are always liable to get
              into these places and crowd out the practicable men, and unless this be put into
              better form I shall be compelled to vote against it. This burdening of the bill with
              things that are arbitrary and contrary to the institutions of our country, I stand
              here to oppose.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRETT. I desired to amend by striking out all that relates to keeping an office
              at the county seat.</p>
            <p>The motion was rejected. Mr. Thayer's amendment was also rejected.</p>
            <p>Mr. OFFUTT moved ineffectually to amend the bill by striking out the fourth section
              as amended.</p>
            <p>Mr. BAKER proposed to amend the substitute by striking out the words "at the county
              seat" and inserting in lieu these words; "At his residence."</p>
            <p>It was rejected.</p>
            <p>The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the adoption of the substitute of the gentleman from
              Johnson, which the Clerk will read.</p>
            <p>It was accordingly again read by the Clerk.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. That's the perfect section ; and when we adopt that, we adopt all that
              we have voted into the section.</p>
            <p>Mr. OGDEN. By the amendment of the gentleman from Ripley (Mr. Willson) the office of
              the Superintendent at the county seat was stricken out, and by another amendment the
              office expenses were stricken out.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. The substance of the amendment of the gentleman from Ripley was to
              strike out the provision that the expenses of the office shall be paid by the county.
              I insist that the substitute before the committee is the substance of all the
              amendments we have adopted.</p>
            <p>Mr. MELLETT. In order that the committee may understand the difference between the
              substitute and the section, as amended, I will simply recite the amendments: First, we
              struck from section 4 the provision that he shall have an office furnished by by the
              County Commissioners. Secondly, we struck out "not less than three nor more than ten,"
              and inserted "four" in lieu. Then we struck out "he shall be allowed his actual office
              expenses," then after the words "per diem" we struck out "and office expenses." Then,
              in line 7, we struck out the words "giving the date, specifying the character of the
              service and the length thereof," and inserted these words: "He shall not be allowed
              for services except as herein expressly provided." The substitute does not give all
              the counts. What I wonted was the County Superintendents.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLSON of Ripley. If we vote in this substitute, we vote in simply what we voted
              out; for we voted that he shall not heve an office at the county seat. If we vote that
              he shall have an office at the county seat we virtually vote that it shall be provided
              for hire; I propose to amend further</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN raised the point of order, (which was sustained,) that further amendments
              are not in order until the vote shall be had on the substitute.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRETT. It seems to me that the object of the gentleman's substitute amendment is
              to restore the section to what it originally was. There is nothing said about expenses
              to be sure ; but if the Superintendent must keep an office he must be there himself.
              All the objections that can be made to the original section apply to this amendment;
              therefore I move to lay it on the table.</p>
            <p>The CHAIRMAN. The motion is out of order. There is no table in Committee of the Whole
              House. The question is on the adoption of the substitute.</p>
            <p>It was rejected.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOODARD. I move that the Committee rise, report the bill to the House, and
              recommend its reference to a special Committeee.</p>
            <p>Mr. WALKER. If this bill has a friend in the State of Indiana he ought to second that
              motion. We have now advanced to the fourth section, and have expended perhaps 800
              dollars worth of time. And the enemies of this bill ought to be satisfied with the
              stabbing which it has received here. I don't think this Committee can sit half an hour
              longer in justice to themselves. The final decision of this matter does not rest up on
              the action of this Committeee. I intend to vote against this bill, and I desire that
              the Committee rise, so that I may meet the question fairly and squarely.</p>
            <pb n="404" xml:id="VAA8558-14-404"/>
            <p>Mr. MELLETT. As to that motion, I differ with the gentleman from Wayne (Mr. Walker).
              I think we have passed over the chief difficulty, but there are questions in it yet
              which demand the deliberate consideration of members ; and I believe the best way to
              come to an agreement, is the course we have taken. I think we have satisfied the
              enemies of this bill in this section.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOODARD. I insist upon my motion : to report the bill to the House and recommend
              its reference to a special Committee of five members.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. I will move to amend the gentleman's motion by making it: that the
              Committee rise and report the bill back to the House without recommendation and
              without amendment.</p>
            <p>Mr. OFFUTT. It seems to me that the motion of the gentleman from Parke (Mr. Woodward)
              ought to prevail. It is certainly apparent to every gentleman that if there are not
              defects in the bill - gentlemen think there are; and if it is referred to the select
              Committee and comes back with amendments, it may, in all probability, pass. The action
              on the bill in this Committee has resulted in no practical good, and if the bill goes
              through in its present shape and finally passes the House, in my judgment it will not
              be worth the paper on which it may be written. Now if there is any merit in the bill
              (and I am not here to deny that there is) let its friends refer it to a special
              Committee for amendment, if it needs amendment, and let it have further consideration
              at another time. I think that the motion of the gentleman from Johnson (Mr. Woollen)
              ought not to prevail.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN'S amendment was rejected and the question recurred on the motion of Mr.
              Woodard that the Committee rise, etc.</p>
            <p>Mr. GLASGOW proposed to amend the motion by making the recommendation of reference to
              a Committee of one from each Congressional district.</p>
            <p>It was rejected ; and then Mr. Woodard's motion was agreed to. Whereupon, the
              Committee rose, and the Chairman reported the bill to the House with the
              recommendation that it be referred to a special Committee of five members.</p>
            <p>The report was concurred in, and the bill was referred to the special Committee which
              the Speaker makes to consist of Messrs. Mellett, Woollen, Lenfesty, Givan and
              Branham.</p>

            <p> The bill [H. R. 211] To appropriate $50,000 for the completion of the Female Prison
              and put the grounds in order, etc., being read the 3rd time - </p>
            <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM, moved to recommit the bill to the <orgName>Committee on
                Prisons</orgName> with instructions to strike out $50,000 and insert $25,000.</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Lawrence, said he had the utmost confidence in the committee which
              recommended the passage of the bill but it seemed to him that this was a very large
              sum, and considering the condition of the State Treasury it would be well to refer
              this to a Committee with instructions to cut down the appropriation one half. If it is
              possible to get along with a less sum, than $50,000 it ought to be done. More than
              that, he was not very favorable to the object for which this money is appropriated. He
              did not believe that in five years from now the State would be satisfied with the
              action.</p>
            <p>Mr. DITTEMORE said there was $15,000 to $20,000 due for work already done, and the
              building is barely inclosed. It seems that this amount is absolutely necessary to pay
              off the indebtedness, and put the building in a condition for use.</p>
            <p>Mr. OLIVER understood that a large amount was now due on account of the construction
              of this building, and that those who had done the work and furnished the materials
              were greatly in need of the money.</p>
            <p>Mr. BEESON said he thought the object of the bill was not understood. Its object was
              twofold, to provide a place of confinement for female convicts and a reformatory
              department for girls. It is conceded that one of the most important steps toward
              prison reform will be accomplished by the separation of the sexes. If the
              appropriation is cut down to $25,000 it will barely pay the indebtedness, and the
              institution will have to remain unfit for use two years longer.</p>
            <p>Mr. NEFF moved to amend by striking out $25,000 and inserting $30,000.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE said he had been informed by Govenor Baker and others in whom he had
              confidence that the appropriation of $50,000 was necessary to pay off the debts and
              complete the building.</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Lawrence, said there were other institutions, the asylums for the
              insane, deaf and dumb, blind, and others, which would be asking for appropriations,
              and which he thought were more worthy than this institution. If this appropriation is
              made he feared it would necessitate the reduction of appropriations to the others.
              There are already institutions in which female delinquents can be confined, and it
              would be better to use them two years longer than jeopardize the institutions which he
              had named.</p>
            <p>The motion to recommit, with instructions, was rejected - yeas 15, nays 25.</p>
            <pb n="406" xml:id="VAA8558-14-406"/>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Lawrence, moved to recommmit to the Committee on Prisons with
              instruction to strike out $50,000 and insert $35,000.</p>
            <p>Mr. WADGE moved to lay the motion on the table. It was agreed to - yeas, 22; nays,
              19.</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH moved to recommit the bill with instructions to strike out $50,000 and
              insert $40,000.</p>
            <p>Mr. DAUGHERTY moved to lay the motion on the table. This motion was agreed to.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS moved the previous question, which was seconded.</p>
            <p>And under its operation the vote on the passage of the bill resulted - yeas, 27;
              nays, 13. So the bill was passed.</p>

              <head rend="center">[CONTINUED FROM PAGE 104 TOP OF SECOND COLUMN.]</head>
              <p>Mr. Collett's bill [S. 76] for an act defining the crime of libel, and prescribing
                punishment therefor was read the third time. [A libel is the malicious defamation of
                a person, made public by any printing, writing, sign, picture or effigy, tending to
                provoke him to wrath, expose him to public hatred or bring him into public
                disrepute, or any malicious defamation of a deceased person, tending to scandalize
                or provoke his surviving relatives or friends. The penalty for libel is fixed at a
                fine of not less than $100 nor more than $3,000, and imprisonment not less than ten
                days nor more than one year. The truth may be proved in defense. Malice will be
                presumed where the allegations are false.]</p>
              <p>Mr. HOUGH moved to recommit the bill to the <orgName>Committee on
                  Judiciary</orgName> with instructions to strike out that portion providing a
                penalty of imprisonment.</p>
              <p>Mr. WADGE moved to lay the motion on the table. The latter motion was agreed
                to.</p>
              <p>Mr. SLATER said this was simply a bill striking at newspapers. According to its
                provisions a man can't say anything against a political opponent tending to bring
                him into disrepute during the heat of a campaign without danger of being clapped
                into prison.</p>
              <p>Mr. HOUGH did not think the bill was striking at anybody, editors or anybody else
                who wanted to do right, but he was in favor of striking out that clause fixing a
                penalty of imprisonment.</p>
              <p>Mr. BROWN said the bill did not strike at newspaper men who ought not to be struck
                at. A custom has grown up of late that makes men's characters of little value to
                them, and the law on the subject of libel is not sufficient to suppress the many
                abuses of personal character which are now prevalent. This bill proposes to make it
                a misdemeanor to publish any false, or malicious statement about any one tending to
                defame his character, bring him into public scandal, disgrace and disrepute, or
                having a tendency to injure him or degrade and dishonor the memory of the dead. It
                seemed to him a very wise one. It was not restricted to newspapers, because any
                injurious or defamatory publication, by handbill, picture, or otherwise is as much a
                libel as any article in a newspaper. But if it has a tendency to restrain a custom
                which has grown up of late years for the press to scandalize, vilify, and traduce
                men's characters, in his opinion it will have accomplished a great and substantial
                good. The Senator over the way [Mr. Slater,] thinks if this bill is passed, the
                press will have no license to say anything against a man in a political campaign. It
                will not so operate, but it will say to editors of all political parties that in the
                heat of all political campaigns their publications must be circumscribed by the
                rules of decency and truth. During the late political campaign men of all parties
                whose characters and integrity were as pure as those of their neighbors and their
                associates were the victims of the malice and scandal and slander of newspaper
                editors, and it seemed to him that the safety of men's characters, the safety of
                men's virtue and the maintenance of public morals require the General Assembly of
                the State of Indiana to throw some restraints around the common scandalizers and
                retailers of falsehood and scandal against public men. And there is another class
                that needs protection. There is a set of men that ought not to bear the name of
                humankind that go about the country publishing and circulating falsehoods about the
                other sex. The victims have not the opportunity of defending themselves at the bar
                of public inquiry that men have, and yet to the shame of Indiana law, it can be said
                that there is no protection afforded them except the mere civil remedy, which is the
                right to sue and recover such damages as a jury may be pleased to assess. In his
                judgment, the best preventive against this indecent warfare and conduct is to let
                the authors of the iniquity know that they will be dealt with as they deserve. The
                press should be and is free, but no highminded man occupying the editorial chair who
                seeks to do exact justice in his publications, who seeks to publish the truth and
                only the truth against his fellow-beings, will complain of this rightful measure of
                legislation.</p>
              <p>Mr. SLATER. It seems to me this bill is unjust in all its provisions. It will have
                no effect apon any class of people, I repeat, except publishers of newspapers. Not
                longer ago than last summer the only reforms we have had in regard to the State
                printing were <pb n="407" xml:id="VAA8558-14-407"/> brought about by newspapers,
                notwithstanding the Court decided that you could not prove any thing wrong in regard
                to this State printing. The people no doubt believe the accusations made by the
                press just and proper.</p>
              <p>Mr. GREGG thought the protection which females need was lost when the bill in
                relation to slander failed to pass. He did not believe that editors were much in the
                habit of attacking that class of people. Public men, more than anybody else -
                politicians, were the ones who would be affected by it, and he seriously doubted the
                policy of a law which would protect politicians against fair criticism or
                investigation either on the stump or by the press of the country. If any man has
                been wronged, he has his remedy at law by a civil suit. He thought it would be a
                dangerous experiment to create the offense a misdemeanor and subject editors and
                newspaper men to indictment and trial in the courts, and possibly to
                imprisonment.</p>
              <p>Mr. GOODING said it seemed to him that this was simply re-enacting what past
                experience had shown was not good. He did not suppose any one there wanted to
                protect slanderers. The question was whether this bill had not great defects in
                itself. He would submit to every lawyer on the floor whether the offense, the crime
                of libel, was defined with the particularity which the Constitution requires. The
                judges would be compelled to construe the law, and one would decide that a certain
                squib in a newspaper was a crime, and the Judge in the adjoining circuit would
                declare that it was not. As the law now is we have certain sets of words that are
                known as slanderous per se, and when you want to allege slander outside of that you
                must allege special damages. The language of this bill is very vague, and we would
                have no uniform ruling by the Judges of the different circuits. We have a good and
                strong law now, providing for a civil suit for libel, whereby not only may actual
                damages be recovered, but the jury may pile up "smart" money. If convictions are
                hard to obtain where only a preponderance of evidence is required, how can a
                conviction be expected where the evidence must be beyond a reasonable doubt? If the
                newspapers slander a man, he can go before a Court and it will leach them a lesson.
                Again, in cases where a criminal prosecution is pending, exemplary damages cannot be
                awarded in the civil action, and he thought the loss of the opportunity to inflict
                exemplary damages upon the libeler would more than counterbalance any benefits that
                might accrue under this bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. HOUGH said the language of the bill was as definite and specific as that of
                what is known as the "provoke law," which had been held good by the Supreme Court,
                and which is executed in every County in this State.</p>
              <p>Mr. GOODING. Has not that provoke law been ridiculed everywhere ?</p>
              <p>Mr. HOUGH. The Superior Court holds it to be a good law - it is more indefinite
                than this bill; hence that objection is untenable.</p>
              <p>Mr. SLATER. If the Legislature has passed one law which has brought us into
                ridicule, is that any reason we should enact another ?</p>
              <p>Mr. HOUGH. This is the law substantially, in about all the States, and it seems to
                me this bill ought to pass. It will leave editors free to publish everything that is
                true of a man, and they ought not to want to publish anything that is not true, or
                which they have riot sufficient evidence to prove.</p>
              <p>Mr. SLATER. According to the provisions of this bill, the Senator or any other man
                may go into a public meeting and make a speech calculated to bring me and my
                newspaper into disrepute and I have no redress in the world.</p>
              <p>Mr. HOUGH. Why didn't you vote for the other bill ? [S. 75,]which just failed for
                want of the Constitutional majority ?</p>
              <p>Mr. DWIGGINS was in favor of the principles contained in the law, but thought the
                bill was defective. It provides that every person who shall publish any libelous
                matter shall be liable to prosecution. What is a publication ? Why, if any newspaper
                in this city should publish a libelous statement about any one, and the speaker
                should come into the Senate and read it aloud in the hearing of other members, he
                would be liable under this law, unless he could prove that it was done without
                malice. The offense, too was not clearly defined. He moved to refer it to the
                Committee on Judiciary, with instructions to define the offense more particularly
                and declare that the author of the libel alone shall be liable.</p>
              <p>Mr. BROWN denied that in the case put by the Senator from Jasper (Mr. Dwiggins,)
                the reading of a libelous article would subject him to penalties proposed by this
                measure, and thought the bill was definite enough. The Senator from Vanderburg, (Mr.
                Gooding,) said it would cut off exemplary damages. That is one of the strongest
                reasons for its passage. Why are exemplary damages allowed in actions for libel?
                Because the libeler has not only committed a wrong against the plaintiff, but an
                offense against society and it is sought to inflict a penalty upon him which will
                deter him from a repetition of this offense against so- <pb n="408"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-14-408"/> ciety, and others from committing it. Now, he did not
                believe it right to allow the plaintiff, over and above his actual damages, to take
                and pocket money assessed as a protection to society. It should go into the coffers
                of the community. If it is right to give exemplary damages because it it an offense
                against the community, why not make it an offense at once, and allow the courts to
                come to the direct question at once in a criminal pleading? Again, the
                impracticability of obtaining satisfactory redress for libel and slander by a civil
                action provokes men to redress their wrongs by personal violence, and leads to riots
                and breaches of the peace.</p>
              <p>Mr. RHODES thought the bill was a very clear innovation on the principles of
                criminal law. It is a rule in our criminal jurisprudence that a defendant who is
                charged with an offense shall have the benefit of any reasonable doubt of his guilt.
                The third section of this bill destroys, so far as this class of prosecutions is
                concerned, that principle entirely. There would be no trouble in prosecuting a
                newspaper publisher under this bill - there would be no difficulty to prove he was a
                publisher, but under the third section unless he can prove beyond a reasonable doubt
                that the libelous matter is absolutely true he stands convicted. I think it is
                unfair.</p>
              <p>Mr. BROWN. That is the law the world over.</p>
              <p>Mr. RHODES. I can't help that. In a civil transaction where one party seeks to
                recover judgment it is necessary to prove that the matter charged as libelious is
                true beyond a reasonable doubt. But that rule does not apply to crimical law, and
                this section changes the practice in regard to that. This third section entirely
                over rides that principle in our criminal law, and I shall vote against it. I move
                to amend the motion of the Senator from Jasper, [Mr. Dwiggins,] by instructing the
                Committee to strike out that third section.</p>
              <p>Mr. GLESSNER, I think the motion to recommit should prevail. The bill ought to
                define to some extent what a libel shall be. He thought the definition of the
                offense was too broad. It does not make it necessary that the party shall be
                disgraced or injured. It is sufficient that the alleged libel <hi rend="i">has a
                  tendency</hi> to disgrace or injure him. This would exclude all adverse criticism
                of any kind upon a public officer.</p>
              <p>Mr. STEELE moved to refer the bill to the <orgName>Committee on Rights and
                  Privileges</orgName>.</p>
              <p>Mr. DAUGHERTY demanded the previous question. It being, seconded by the Senate both
                motions to refer to a Committee with instructions, were rejected, and the bill
                itself was also lost by yeas 16, nays 19 - as follows:</p>

            <p>The Senate met pursuant to adjournment, President Friedley in the chair. The reading

            <div type="section">
              <head rend="center">INSANE ASYLUMS.</head>
              <p>Mr. CHAPMAN moved that the House concurrent resolution instructing the Committee on
                Benevolent Institutions to prepare plans for a building for the insane and divide
                the State into three districts, be taken up.</p>
              <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
              <p>Mr. O'BRIEN was opposed to the division of the State into three insane districts,
                and to this scattering of State institutions. It was unnecessary and expensive.</p>
              <p>Mr. DAGGY, too, was in favor of one central institution large enough to accommodate
                all the insane in the State, even if it costs five hundred thousand dollars. One
                objection urged against it is that it will make it inconvenient for their friends to
                visit them. This will be an advantage to them. The farther an insane man is removed
                from his friends, the better for him. It is the universal testimony that when the
                friends of insane persons visit them it always makes them in restless and irritable,
                and retards their cure.</p>
              <p>Mr. OLIVER said Mr. Daggy's remarks were strictly correct. Insane men, many of
                them, are remarkably acute. Even a paragraph in the newspapers concerning the
                erection of a building for them will excite them to such a degree that they will not
                recover for six weeks, and the visit of their friends do them far more harm than
                good. More than that, the expense of three separate institutions will be much
                greater than that of one. He hoped that Senators would give this matter serious
                consideration, for it is a collossal question;a big question; one of the very
                greatest interest. Such is our system of Railroads that out of the ninety-three
                counties in the State of Indiana, persons residing in eighty-four or eighty three of
                them can reach Indianapolis and return home the same day. So the argument against
                patients being too far away from their Mends is no argument against the location of
                a new asylum at the Capital of the State.</p>
              <p>Mr. CHAPMAN said: My purpose in calling up the resolution was not to provoke
                discussion. It was simply to get something before the Senate and House on this
                subject. The necessity of providing a suitable place for the care of the insane is a
                very pressing one, but after the resolution is reported from the committee it will
                be time enough for Senators to discuss the question. This is not the time for
                discussion. Perhaps gentlemen have not thought on this subject. I am in favor of
                providing ample accommodations for every insane person in the State of Indiana, and
                I don't care so much where the institution is located. It is an outrage upon our
                State to have our insane kept in the poor houses. I <pb n="410"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-14-410"/> have been almost ready to say that I never would vote a
                single dollar out of the Treasury for any purpose whatever until the insane are
                properly provided for. Now it is nearly the middle of the session and yet nothing
                has been done in this matter.</p>
              <p>Mr. GLESSNER. I understand this is a concurrent resolution from the House of
                Representatives. The proposition is to make appropriations for Insane Asylums, and
                we are called upon to determine the question whether we will construct and establish
                such institutions In different parts of the State. It occurs to me now is the time
                to determine this question. However I think it not best to take up much time in
                discussing it, but let the resolution go to the committee on Benevolent Institutions
                and let them examine and report what they think best under the present
                circumstances. I think it best to have the buildings erected adjoining the
                institution already built, and I am willing to vote any appropriation the committee
                may think right and proper. The want of proper accommodations for the insane of the
                State is a thing that has been complained of more than any other. There has been a
                greater outrage committed in Indiana upon the incurable insane than by any other
                State in the Union. I find we are behind most of the States in this matter. Men of
                any experience know that the insane have died in little cells in our county poor
                houses for want of the attention of persons who know how to take care of them. I
                have always been ready and willing to vote the largest appropriations for this
                unfortunate class, and I think the subject ought to be taken up and perfected at an
                early day.</p>
              <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. I move to amend the motion so as to refer the resolution to the
                committee named to inquire and report upon the best place for locating the
                additional building or buildings and the amount of appropriation necessary. If the
                committee are to procure proper plans and determine upon the best and cheapest mode
                of building, and select the places for them, they cannot do all that this session.
                It occurs to me that all we can do is to ascertain where we will put these
                buildings, make the appropriations and appoint a commission to adopt plans and let
                the contract. If we require the committee to present plans and specifications when
                they have only a few days to do it in, it will be a chance if we get what we want. </p>
              <p>Mr. ORR. I can see no propriety in making three seperate places for these
                institutions. Let us appropriate as much as is necessary to provide accommodations
                for this unfortunate class and let the buildings be erected in this city.</p>
              <p>Mr. HOUGH. I move to amend the amendment so as to instruct the committee to inquire
                and report as to the necessity for an extension of the building on the present site.
                The establishment of 3 seperate institutions will be attended with unnecessary
                expense. We see the folly of dividing our educational institutions. All are asking
                for enormous appropriations. One half of the money they ask for, if expended in one
                locality, would make an institution of which we would all feel proud, but squandered
                in different directions, we may appropriate all the money they ask and still our
                institutions will be of an inferior grade compared with younger States than ours.
                And it will be so with our benevolent institutions if they are divided. It will not
                be long if hospitals are established in different localities before we will have
                more offices connected with our State institutions than there are members of the
                Senate. They will have to be elected biennially and receive salaries that will
                amount to as much as the legislation of State costs. I thik this idea of dividing up
                these institutions savors of foolishness.</p>
              <p>Mr. THOMPSON, (interposing). There has been an expression from various portions of
                the State in favor of seperate institutions in different localities which caused the
                Governor to mention the subject in his message.</p>
              <p>Mr. HOUGH. It seems to me that inasmuch as we have one hundred and sixty acres of
                land where the institution is already located that the additional buildings can be
                located there as well and better than if they were one hundred miles apart. What I
                am talking about is the economy in keeping the institution where it now is and
                putting up additional buildings on the ground we now already own, so that one corps
                of ofticern may run the whole institution. If divided and two other buildings
                erected in different localities, we will have to have three seperate sets of
                officers. I hope the amendment I proposed will be adopted. Let the committee be
                confined to the inquiry whether additional buildings are necessary on the present
                site of the hospital for the Insane.</p>
              <p>Mr. HALL. I think it would be good policy if all our educational institutions were
                located at one point. Confine them to one spot and it would be economy to the State,
                but this rule don't apply to the particular item of expenditure we are now
                considering. We are obliged to take the opinion of medical men on this subject and I
                believe their judgment is almost unanimous against having too large a number of
                insane persons in one locality. They assure us that there should not be over six
                hundred in any one locality.</p>
              <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. I will now send up my amendment.</p>
              <p>It was read by the Secretary as follows: <pb n="411" xml:id="VAA8558-14-411"/>
                "Strikeout all after the word 'two' in line two, page two, and insert the following:
                inquire and report the amount that should be appropriated to build additional
                buildings lor the insane and also report where such additional buildings should be
                erected and all matters pertaining thereto and report by bill or otherwise.'"</p>
              <p>Mr. O'BRIEN. I offer the following as a substitute for the resolution and the
                amendments:</p>
              <floatingText>
                <body>
                  <div type="resolution">
                    <p>Resolved, That the <orgName>committee on Benevolent Institutions</orgName> be
                      and are hereby instructed to inquire into the propriety of enlarging the
                      present building for the accommodation of the insane of the State, or for the
                      building of new buildings on the ground now owned by the State, and report
                      plans and specifications for such buildings.</p>
                  </div>
                </body>
              </floatingText>
              <p>Mr. HALL. I believe I would favor the substitute but for one single matter and that
                is time. I think this a case where we ought to take some steps immediately towards
                providing additional accommodations for our insane. We must take some care of these
                fifteen hundred unfortunates now scattered over the State.</p>
              <p>Mr. GOODING. Gentlemen say that they have already ground enough and that it would
                be expensive to build elsewhere. I think donations of ground could be had in the
                northern and southern portions of the State for this purpose. I venture to say
                Vanderburgh county will give ground for an asylum to be established there.</p>
              <p>Mr. DWIGGINS, (interposing). Jasper county will give a section.</p>
              <p>Mr. GOODING, (resuming.) We have it from physicians of character that it is a very
                grave question whether these persons can be better benefited by being kept seperate
                than together. It would seem that the gentleman offering amendments don't wish the
                committee to have an opportunity to consider this grave question. He wants to
                instruct the committee to have this institution located at Indianapolis. I say let
                us leave this question of location to the committee and with the opinion of medical
                men thereon,we may go into a discussion of its merits. I don't think it right in the
                face of the suggestion of the gentleman from Floyd [Mr. Hall] that the medical
                fraternity are of the opinion that it is better for the patients to be seperated - I
                don't think it right for us to say that we will instruct the committee to pay no
                attention to that suggestion. I think that we had better leave the committee free to
                confer with medical men and come back here with information, make a recommendation
                to the Senate and then we can discuss the question. We are prematurely tieing up the
                hands of the committee. If those persons can be treated better seperately than
                together, I want to know what Senator will insist on forcing them together upon the
                plea of economy. If they can be better carred for seperate than together, I want to
                know what Senator will stand upon this floor, and upon the plea of economy have them
                penned together in one place.</p>
              <p>Mr. STEELE. The resolution should go no farther than to inquire if such buildings
                should be built. As far as the specifications are concerned, would it not be much
                better, instead of loading them down with that, to require them to report simply a
                finding whether any such buildings are required at all? We should first determine
                what we want. Then time should be given, and we have only about a month to work in.
                The specifications can be more properly made after we determine where we will have
                the buildings. It would be burdening the committee with a matter they should not be
                burdened with now. I am in favor of making such appropriations as are absolutely
                necessary and would desire the committee to make a report of what expenditures are
                necessary in their opinion. And I think that a report should be make at a very early
                day.</p>
              <p>Mr. SCOTT. I understand the proposition would bring us to a test vote upon the two
                plans, either to put the buildings here or somewhere else. If we adopt the
                substitute, here is the place; if we vote it down, then we are willing to put it
                some where else.</p>
              <p>Mr. GOODING. I don't think that necessarily follows.</p>
              <p>Mr. SCOTT. I call for the previous question. I think the Senate is ready to vote
                upon it.</p>
              <p>This demand for the previous question was seconded by the Senate and the substitute
                [Mr. O'Brien's] was rejected byyeas 18, nays 20, - see page 109. </p>

            <p>Pending the order for the introduction of new bills - </p>
            <p>Mr. THOMPSON presented a petition from certain colored citizens in favor thereof and
              introduced a bill [S. 276,] for an act repealing section 47 of the felony act of June
              10, 1852, prohibiting the intermarriage of white and colored persons.</p>
            <p>Mr. SMITH moved that the bill be rejected.</p>
            <p>Mr. WADGE moved to lay the motion on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. CAVE hoped the latter motion would be withdrawn. He was, perhaps, as much opposed
              to the bill as any Senator on the floor, but he did not wish discussion cut off.</p>
            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR (who had come in since the Senate was called to order)
              decided Mr. Wadge's motion out of order.</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Lawrence, hoped the gentleman from Fulton, (Mr. Smith,) would
              withdraw his motion for the present, even if it was to be renewed hereafter, for the
              reason that there was a great deal of work to be done, and the call of the ayes and
              noes would undoubtedly adjourn the Senate, as it is apparent that we have no quorum
              present.</p>
            <p>Mr. Smith - Will the gentleman agree to renew the motion when there is a full
              Senate?</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence, I will make no such arrangement. If the Senator feels
              disposed to make that motion when there is a quorum present I will make no objection,
              but I hope he will withdraw the motion for the present.</p>
            <p>Mr. THOMPSON said: Mr. President, I cannot believe that any motion or proposition to
              close this chamber against hearing and considering the claims of any portion of our
              citizens, however humble can receive the sanction, or escape the scrutiny and
              rejection of this Senate. To instruct his representatives and to apply to his General
              Assembly for redress of grievances, is the high privilege and sacred right of every
              American, and is confirmed by the legislative history of our country. The bill sought
              to be rejected accompanies and is an embodiment of the petition of the representatives
              of twenty-five thousand of Indiana's citizens, legions of whom have proved their
              devotion to the country, in the struggles and achievements on the battlefield of the
              Republic. The only plea for rejecting the demands of this bill is that the petitioners
              for its passage, have inherited from African ancestry black skins. True their skin is
              dark, but time and circumstances have mingled, in them, the blood of all nations.
              Underneath this dark complexion, their arteries circulate as generous blood as ever
              coursed through kings or <pb n="413" xml:id="VAA8558-14-413"/> senators. Their minds
              have freely imbibed the spirit of civil liberty, and to day moving forward in the
              great race of life, they aspire to lay hold of every aid the country affords; to
              enlighten their minds, to improve their condition and prepare them for the
              responsibilities and duties of citizens and patriots. To this exhalted position,they
              have been brought by the logic of events, and the sovereign will of the nation, and we
              will stop short of our duty to ourselves and duty to these our petitioners, if we fail
              to consider their rights or refuse to remove every obstacle to their progress in
              education, self respect, and virtuous deeds.</p>
            <p>Mr. SMITH (interposing.) This is not a motion to reject the petition - it is only a
              motion to reject the bill. I want the Senator to state the facts.</p>
            <p>Mr. FULLER. The only question is, shall the bill be rejected? Discussion is out of
              order.</p>
            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVENOR. I do not think the point of order is well taken.</p>
            <p>Mr. THOMPSON. The fourteenth amendment of our national constitution has clothed these
              people with all the rights of citizenship, and placed them on an equality of
              conditions, before the law, with the most favored classes of our country. And he is a
              short sighted statesman, who supposes, that, by rejecting the present bills from the
              consideration of this Senate, he can perpetuate the invidious Statutes of June 10,
              1852, which the Bill seeks to repeal, and which is clearly in conflict with the
              national rights of every citizen, of African descent. The constitution of the country
              has wisely placed its judicial power beyond the control of political factions, party
              ambition and personal prejudice. Its watchful care presides over the civil and
              religious rights of the humblest subject, and its final decision can cause even
              legislative acts to conform to the principles of law and justice. If party spirit and
              disappointed ambition, or personal pride and sectional prejudice shall prompt this
              legislature to drive these people, seeking a redress of their grievances, from these
              halls, they can have recourse to this our national Tribune. And although the process
              may prove tedious and expensive, yet the best legal minds of the nation join in
              assuring them of final victory. Will it not be regarded inhumane, uncivil and bad
              policy, in the lawmakers of Indiana, if by their act this day, they force her citizens
              to ask the Courts of the nation to enforce justice and protect their rights at home?
              When the Senator from Owen (Mr. Dittimore,) on a motion made by himself, to take the
              Beacon, (a paper published in the interests of the Colored people,) for the benefit of
              Senators, made a speech of such unparalleled beauty and Christian refinement, brim
              full of lofty sentiments of humanity - and burning eloquence - in favor of encouraging
              this rising people every kind heart responded to the music of joy, that suddenly, as
              by a mighty rushing wind, an able advocate, and a generous legislator, had appeared
              fresh from the sugar camps of Owen; who would be to the colored race a true friend and
              faithful councelor. Will he on this occasion by his vote."Make our expectations vain -
              and disappoint our trusts." [laughter.] For the sake of the interests and character of
              our great State, as well for the peace and happiness of our petitioning citizens, I
              implore gentlemen of all parties, who are here the representatives of an intelligent
              people, acting as legislators to calmly consider before they by their votes, drive
              these people from this hall to seek their rights in the Courts of the nation. Their
              success abroad, will be our disgrace at home. I would say to the author of this
              movement, the polite and very pleasant Senator from Fulton, (Mr. Smith,) withdraw your
              motion to reject the bill which proposes to remove the dishonoring barr from twenty
              five thousand of the citizens of Indiana; whom the nation has enfranchised and invited
              to the pursuits of equal honors and equal rewards. And when time shall call upon you
              to retrospect the work of life, you may not have to summon your tears to assuage the
              lashings of conscience, and apply to the Fountain of Forgivness to wash away the sin
              of refusing to hear the poor when they cried for help. The interest I feel in this
              subject before the Senate is my only apology for occupying so much of its precious
              time.</p>
            <p>Mr. SMITH. From the fact that there is not a quorum here, and out of respect to the
              Senator who has just taken his seat, I will withdraw my motion.</p>
            <p>Mr. SLATER. I renew the motion.</p>
            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVENOR. The bill will pass to the second reading if there is no
              objection. It was so ordered. </p>

          <p>The consideration of Mr. Taylor's bill, [S. 170,] making an appropriation for the
            completion of Purdue University, which was pending at the noon adjournment, was resumed;
            the question being on Mr. Bunyan's amendment to the amendment proposed by the committee,
            reducing the appropriation to fifty thousand dollars.</p>
          <p>Mr. DITTEMORE spoke against the bill. He said: Until the farming class come and ask for
            it, I am not willing to vote to appropriate this large amount of money. What caused this
            institution to be called the "Purdue University?" Why was not it called the "Indiana
            Agricultural College?" Simply because we were led to believe that munificent grants
            would be given by the man whose name the institution was to bear. The inducements were,
            the State would not be called upon for a single dollar. One of the largest inducements
            held out for the location of the University in Tippecanoe county, and the giving of its
            present name, was the assurance that it should never become a charge upon the State. I
            have before me a resolution offered by the gentleman from Monroe, [Mr. Buskirk] in the
            House of Representatives at the time this College was located, to strike out Purdue
            University and insert Indiana Agricultural College in lieu. [It is on page 168 of the
              <hi rend="sc">BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS</hi>, volume XI.] Mr. Buskirk said: "I have
            not had the opportunity of discussing the amendment which I proposed, and for that
            reason, if for no other, I should vote "No" on this motion. I would like to have tested
            the sincerity of these gentlemen who stand up here in favor of this location in
            Tippecanoe county, to see if they meant what they said when they told the people of the
            State if they got this location, this College should never cost the State a dollar."</p>
          <p>Other counties were represented, and county boards were sending up propositions to
            secure the location, but all these were overshadowed by the liberal proposition of Mr.
            Purdue. We have made experiments of this kind in favor of educational institutions over
            at Terre Haute, but do not want them built up at the expense of the State for the
            purpose of advancing real estate in certain localities. While I am willing to build up
            such institutions, I am not willing to advance the price of property in the various
            counties of the State at the expense of the tax-payers. I would cheerfully vote for
            liberal appropriations to have the educational interests of the State concentrated. The
            institution at Terre Haute has been an experimental very dear one to the people of
            Indiana. I have been unable to learn where any practical results have grown out of that
            institution except in so far as it is a beautiful edifice. This institution in
            Tippecanoe county smacks a great deal <pb n="415" xml:id="VAA8558-14-415"/> in
            similarity with the institution at Terre Haute inasmuch as it is for the purpose of
            enhancing property in that part of the State. We have not advanced any money to Purdue
            university hitherto, and I am opposed to it now.</p>
          <p>Mr. BOONE said large amounts had been appropriated to develope the mineral resources of
            the State. It began with small sums and had been increased from time to time until large
            sums were demanded and confidently expected to be appropriated to Geological Surveys.
            The results had been gratifying to every one whether farmer, manufacturer or capitalist.
            It had developed in a practical way, large coal fields and other mineral wealth in the
            south and southwestern portions of the State. It invited the investment of capital and
            stimulated indirectly manufacturers. These matters were now on a permanent basis and
            under the influences of capital would never go back, but would continue to expand. It
            was not for an hour nor a day only, but for all time to come. The addition to the wealth
            of the State from these sources was immense and the opening and working of the mines and
            quarries furnished employment for labor of all grades, from mere brute force to the very
            perfection of science and art.</p>
          <p>These appropriations were becoming local and individual rather than general over the
            State. The general limits of the coal fields of the State had been known for years and
            the business now was to show where and how individuals should operate with
            certainty.</p>
          <p>So with other quarries of valuable stone which were being tested and specimens placed
            before the capitalist, the artisan and the builder.</p>
          <p>There was no where that specimens of soils of Indiana could be found with analysis of
            their adaptibility to the production of the cereals or the grasses. This is still left
            to individual effort and individual taste.</p>
          <p>The State University has its Scientific, Law and Medical departments. Much of the
            instruction given is applicable to any profession or business. But there are also
            specialties in professional life, and the tendency is to lead young men into these,
            often against their inclinations because they are taught here, and others are purging
            that course.</p>
          <p>There is the learned Professor of the Law, who explains that abstruse science and by
            moot courts demonstrates the theory and the practice of that profession. The student is
            instructed and practiced in all the rules of our courts, pleading and practice so that
            he goes at once to business with professional skill that cannot fail of appreciation by
            the courts and tho bar.</p>
          <p>In the Medical department every facility is offered to the medical student. The theory
            and the practice are taught by men learned in the science of the profession. Surgical
            operations of great skill are performed in their presence, and by their own hands, under
            the direction of scientific men. Commercial men, bankers, merchants, engineers &amp;c.,
            are all provided with schools, and apparatus to demonstrate the complicated practice of
            their several professions. This is all well enough, except that we hear it said that in
            practice these professions and businesses are over crowded. There are too many young men
            quitting the farm and going into these professions.</p>
          <p>Why is this? Possibly because the State encourages it by appropriations and honors
            which lure them to the professions. The professions of the farmer and the mechanic ought
            to be learned. It is lauded by politicians before the elections, but is seldom heard of
            afterwards, except in derision or downright insult by the offer of a reward for
            fox-scalps or that their homes, their farms, and their stock are not to be
            protected.</p>
          <p>The offering of small premiums for their products through the State Board of
            Agriculture is mere surface work and does not go to the science of the profession. What
            they want is how and the where to operate, and the scientific demonstration of what the
            soil and elements of a particular locality will most successfully produce. As in the
            other professions, provide a place where both the theory and the practice of the art are
            demonstrated to the young mind and the novice in the practical way. Will this University
            furnish this want? The United States has made a liberal donation for the endowment of
            the institution. The State has already located it at a point where the donations have
            been large and liberal. It is in a fine agricultural region - among the finest in the
            State; and from the magnificent donations would seem to be surrounded by its friends.
            Let the experiment be tried as in the other great educational enterprises. The committee
            have reported the smallest amount which in their judgement will secure to this
            institution the magnificent endowments offered it and put it upon a self-sustaining
            basis. Then let the judgement of the committee be carried out.It is urged that people
            are not interested in this University; that they are not here asking the appropriation.
            The men who are to be benefited by this institution of learning and who are looking with
            pride ufon its permanent establishment, are not lobbyists; they are not talkers and
            lecturers but the every day workers in the developement of the substantial wealth of the
            country and of the State. It is not true that there is no desire among farmers and
            mechanics for the establishment of the University, There <pb n="416"
              xml:id="VAA8558-14-416"/> are hundreds of young men now in the State who are desirous
            to receive the instruction in theory and in practice of the arts.</p>
          <p>The State is not favorably situated to reckon a per centage of the products of other
            States as her profits. Cheap freights are a long way in the future to her products. She
            should therefore not send abroad her gross material, but manufactured articles. Then let
            us educate the heads and the hands that are to produce these results within our own
            State. Agriculture is no longer a success without science and this institution, with the
            proper means, will furnish facilities for the education of farmer's sons. It is not all
            of farming to follow the plow, and the science cannot be completed in a day. What is
            wanted is to know the where and the how, and leave the result to the skill and the taste
            of the individual, as in other professions. The farming interests is of the utmost
            importance to the State and we cannot longer depend upon the accidents of crops. Teach
            the art of using our soil and climate so as to produce the best results thorough
            culture, home adornments, home comforts and prosperity will follow.</p>
          <p>Mr. CARNAHAN. I think there was not a pledge made that Tippecanoe county never would
            ask the State for any appropriation. I am sure there was no such promise made. I held a
            seat in the other end of the Capitol at that time and I went for locating that
            institution at Bloomington, knowing that we had one there already, but thinking that by
            uniting the two, they would be more likely to make an institution of character. I
            remember distinctly that several counties put in their claims. Putnam and various other
            counties offered liberal donations providing the institution was located within their
            limits. I remember very well the proposition made by Tippecanoe county and I believe the
            promise on the part of that county has been fulfilled to the letter. If she had failed
            to do anything she had promised and if Mr. Purdue had failed to fulfill his promise, I
            would feel disposed to censure them, but I contend that both Tippecanoe county and Mr.
            Purdue have done all they agreed to. Now, Sir, I am decidedly opposed to this motion to
            cut down the appropriation proposed by the committee. I would prefer to increase it. I
            would be perfectly willing to vote one hundred thousand dollars to aid that institution
            in getting a start. A large donation has been made by Congress and by Mr. Purdue and by
            the county of Tippecanoe, and I cannot see how we, in the face of all this, can say that
            the State of Indiana shall appropriate nothing. The argument of the Senator from Owen,
            [Mr. Dittemore], is that farmer boys need nothing of that kind to aid them. I am
            satisfied that it is as equally essential that the farmers should be instructed how to
            manage the different soils as it is for the lawyer to be instructed how to advocate his
            case before a court. There have been large donations made to institutions of learning
            all over the State. At Bloomington we educate Lawyers, Doctors and Preachers, but they
            do not educate farmers there. This institution at LaFayette is the only one that will
            teach the farmer how to make the soil pay, yet we are so pernurious that we will not
            appropriate money to it. I am satisfied it is esential that a farmer should be
            instructed in these matters; and that the institution will do great good, I have no
            doubt. I remember when this matter was pending over in the House. When we discovered
            that we could not succeed in getting the location at Bloomington, Mr. Buskirk proposed
            to me that he should get up a resolution declaring that there should not be any money
            appropriated by the State to that institution and he told me afterwards that he could
            not find in the hotel one member that would support such a resolution. He then abandoned
            that idea and took up what we find in the <hi rend="sc">BREVIER REPORTS</hi> as read by
            the Senator from Owen, [Mr. Dittemore.] That shows that the State was unwilling to bind
            herself that she would not give anything. I am inclined to think that Tippecanoe county
            is not bound for a cent beyond what she promised, and no Senator has attempted to show
            that Mr. Purdue or the county has not done what they agreed to. It is as much the duty
            of the State to educate her farmers as her lawyers and preachers, and it is as necessary
            that they should be educated. I would rather increase the appropriation to one hundred
            thousand dollars than reduce it to fifty thousand dollars. I hope the motion to reduce
            the appropriation will fail.</p>
          <p>Mr. FULLER. I do not say that there was a promise made that the State would not be
            called upon for anything, but I do do say, that the time the bill was passed and the
            University located it was understood that the one hundred and fifty thousand dollars
            subscribed by Mr. Purdue and the fifty thousand dollars subscribed by Tippecanoe county
            would be sufficient. It was said and brought out in the discussion - when suggested in
            debate, that if the fifteen thousand dollars per year from the former and the ten
            thousand a year from the latter would not be sufficient, it was stated by members that
            Mr. Purdue had said if the amount was not sufficient he would pay in the money as fast
            as it was wanted. I can show that by the BREVIER REPORTS. It was brought up in that
            discussion, also, that this money was to be used for building purposes. When Mr. Buskirk
            put the question to the gentleman <pb n="417" xml:id="VAA8558-14-417"/> from Tippecanoe
            county whether any of this money would be used for building purposes, he replied that it
            was understood that it would be used for buying real estate. With that understanding the
            College was located. I am satisfied with the location but I am not willing to accept the
            doctrine, that because we withold a condition to this College we are opposed to
            education. It is not true. </p>
          <p>Mr. BROWN. It is a matter of some mortification that a measure like this should meet
            with opposition. A sense of gratitude as well as a sense of justice and a desire to
            advance the educational interest of the State should move all to make prompt
            appropriation in behalf of this institution. It was due to the generosity ofCongress and
            to the generosity of Mr. Purdue and Tippecanoe county who have donated liberally to the
            enterprise. It is well known to us that Congress donated land script to the State of
            Indiana, the proceeds arising from the sale of which to be considered an endowment fund
            to establish an Agricultural College. This endowment fund, large as it seemed to be in
            the first instance, has increased from two hundred and twelve to fourteen thousand
            dollars. This is the last ascertained amount of the fund, and to that we may add
            interest from January last. This fund cannot be diverted to any other use than that of
            an endowment fund. It cannot be used for the purpose of investing in realty, in
            buildings, in improving the site or any other purpose that is calculated to add to the
            property of the College. Congress made some limitation - that within a certain length of
            time the College must be put in working condition. The time has expired and the
            generosity of Congress has extended the time. If the people do justice this fund may be
            continued to the State and become a vast source of profit. Of course it was necessary to
            have buildings there and they are in process of construction, but without the means to
            complete them, they necessarily fall to the ground. All that is asked now is that the
            State come to the rescue and lend a helping hand in order that this great school of
            learning may be put into operation.</p>
          <p>Mr. THOMPSON, (interposing.) What became of the fund given by the great Purdue?</p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR. As far as the donation of Judge Purdue is concerned he has fully paid up
            all that was coming from him, and no more would be required of him under the law until
            1874. He has paid all the installments that are due up to that time - some sixty
            thousand dollars. Twenty-four thousand dollars has been invested in land and the
            remainder in buildings and materials with which to build. His donation was fifteen
            thousand dollars annually for ten years, making a total of one hundred and fifty
            thousand dollars.</p>
          <p>Mr. BROWN. Thus it appears, Mr. President, everything promised by the General
            Government, by Tippecanoe county and Mr. Purdue has been complied with. Indiana will do
            herself credit and profit her citizens by taking hold and completing the work. The
            farmers have never been backward in voting the means to educate professional men, and
            now, for the first time put in a plea in behalf of their own class. The justice of this
            claim needs no argument. It speaks for itself. It seems to me that any professional man
            who would refuse to aid it would exhibit a species of ingratitude unknown to the Hoosier
            character. Not having an opportunity to take advantage of these institutions of
            learning, yet as an humble member of one of the most distinguished branches of a
            professional character known to the country I feel that I would be doing injustice to my
            profession and dishonor to my character did I not stand by the Sons of Toil who produce
            the means of subsistance that you and I feed on, and contribute to the existance of that
            institution which will make their business profitable.</p>
          <p>Mr. STEELE called attention to the fact that before the meeting of the next General
            Assembly, the limit of time fixed by Congress in which the endowment fund may be availed
            of will have expired, consequently the question is presented now to the Legislature
            whether they will do anything or the grant thus lapsing all that has been done
            heretofore will be lost.I hope the Senate will vote the amount proposed in the bill. The
            funds have been placed partially under the control of the State Agricultural
            Society.</p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR. The State Board of Agriculture is represented by three members on the board
            of trustees. It nominates three members and they are appointed by the Governor.</p>
          <p>Mr. CHAPMAN. Has there been any report made so far?</p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR. I understand it is embodied in the State Agricultural Report.</p>
          <p>Mr. GOODING moved the previous question which was seconded by the Senate and the main
            question ordered.</p>
          <p>The amendment of Mr. Bunyan reducing the appropriation to fifty thousand dollars was
            rejected - yeas 15, nays 27. Pending the roll-call - </p>
          <p>Mr. ORR, in explanation of his vote, said: Gentlemen say that Tippecanoe county
            promised that no call would be made for money from the State and others say she did not.
            How can I ascertain who is right?</p>
          <p>Mr. STEELE (and other Senators). Go to the record.</p>
          <p>Mr. ORR, (continuing.) Our State is covered with Agricultural Colleges teach27 <pb
              n="418" xml:id="VAA8558-14-418"/> ing us farmers how to farm. I am a farmer myself, I
            vote "Aye."</p>
          <p>The result of the vote was then announced as above recorded.</p>
          <p>The report of the majority of the committee was then concurred in - yeas 28, nays
            14.</p>
          <p>Pending the roll-call - </p>
          <p>Mr. FULLER in explanation of his vote, said he had no confidence that this Agricultural
            College would be a success.</p>
          <p>Mr. HALL in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said he was obliged
            reluctantly to vote against the bill for we are frittering away our money on two or
            three institutions in different parts of the State when they should be nearer
            together.</p>
          <p>Mr. O'BRIEN in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said : I vote for
            this appropriation cheerfully, but I want it distinctly understood in doing so, I have
            not changed my notion. I think the State has been in error in legislation heretofore and
            agree, to some extent with the gentleman from Floyd, [Mr. Hall.] I hope to be able to
            vote for a measure remedying this evil to some extent, but I am willing to vote this
            appropriation in order to avail ourselves of the means within our reach.</p>
          <p>Mr. SLATER, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said : This appears
            to me to be an experiment and one hundred and fifty thousand dollars given by Mr. Furdue
            and fifty thousand given by the county of Tippecanoe and two hundred and twenty-eight
            thousand by the general government is a sufficient amount of money to try as an
            experiment a thing that all foreign countries have decided to be a failure. I therefore
            vote "No."</p>
          <p>Mr. THOMPSON in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: In the present
            depleted condition of our treasury I was in hopes that we could have agreed upon a less
            sum for Purdue University. I remember great promises were made in the Senate Chamber,
            with regard to this University. I think the Board of Trustees have not done all they
            ought to have done. I think the building ought to be up by this time.</p>
          <p>The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.</p>
          <p>Mr. BROWN moved that the order of business be suspended, and the bill read the second
            time.</p>
          <p>This motion was agreed to and the bill was then read the second time.</p>
          <p>Mr. SLATER moved to amend by inserting a section making an appropriation of ten
            thousand dollars to Franklin College, as an endowment fund.</p>
          <p>Mr. BROWN moved to lay the amendment upon the table for the reason that each
            institution asking an appropriation should stand upon its own merits.</p>
          <p>The yeas and nays being demanded this motion was agreed to - yeas 35, nays 7.</p>
          <p>Mr. DITTEMORE moved to amend by striking out sixty thousand dollars and inserting
            fifty-five thousand dollars.</p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR moved to lay the amendment on the table.</p>
          <p>The yeas and nays being demanded the motion was agreed to - yeas 27, nays 14.</p>
          <p>The bill was then ordered to be engrossed. </p>

          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the special order for half past ten o'clock - Senate
            Bill No. 238 to divide the State into circuits for judicial purposes.</p>
          <p>Mr. Brown moved to postpone the special order until to morrow at 10 A. M.</p>
          <p>It was rejected.</p>
          <p>The Senate then went into a <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName>, for the
            consideration of the bill, with Mr. Dwiggins in the chair.</p>
          <p>The bill was read by sections.</p>
          <p>Mr. GLESSNER offered a resolution that the bill be referred back to the <orgName>Select
              Joint Committee</orgName>, with instructions to increase the time of holding courts in
            the several districts each year from 36 to 42 weeks, and that all amendments submitted
            to the bill in the Committee of the Whole, be referred with the bill to the same
            committee.</p>
          <p>Mr. SCOTT moved to amend the resolutions so as to refer the bill to the Committee on
            Judiciary to perfect it.</p>
          <p>The CHAIR decided the resolution out of order.</p>
          <p>Mr. SCOTT then moved that the committee rise and recommend to the Senate that the bill
            be referred to the Committee on Judiciary to perfect it.</p>
          <p>Mr. GLESSNER moved to amend so as to refer it to the Select Joint Committee on the
            subject.</p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH made the point of order that the select Committee having discharged the duty
            assigned to it is now dissolved.</p>
          <p>The CHAIRMAN held the point well taken.</p>
          <p>Mr. BROWN moved to amend Mr. Scott's motion so as to refer the matter to a Select
            Committee of one from each Congressional District, and Mr. Scott accepted the
            amendment.</p>
          <p>Mr. RHODES offered a substitute to refer the matter to a Special Committee of thirteen
            with instructions to report a bill containing the following points: 1. Redistricting the
            State for judicial purposes, equalizing, as nearly as possible, the labor in the Circuit
            and Common Pleas Courts, making such changes in the number and territorial jurisdiction
            of the same as may be necessary to accomplish that object. 2. In counties where there
            are no Criminal Courts, transfering all the criminal business to the Common Pleas
            Courts.</p>
          <p>Mr. DAGGY said he wanted some expression from the Senate on the subject of abolishing
            the Courts of Common Pleas. For himself, he did not believe they were prepared to do
            that yet, but he would like to know how Senators stood. He therefore moved to amend the
            substitute by striking out of the instructions all that relates to Common Pleas
            Courts,</p>
          <p>Mr. GOODING. The only material difference between the Circuit and Common Pleas Courts
            is that the latter is charged <pb n="420" xml:id="VAA8558-14-420"/> with probate
            business. Why have two courts covering the same territory with concurrent jurisdiction?
            Why won't one court answer the purpose ? The bill under consideration simply requires
            the Circuit Courts to perform the duties heretofore discharged by the Common Pleas
            Courts, no more and no less. A surrogate system is not necessary. Some gentlemen say the
            Circuit judges won't have time; - I think they will have plenty time, and if we confer
            Common Pleas jurisdiction upon Circuit Courts, why can't the Circuit Court do all? By
            passing this bill we would save thousands of dollars to the State of Indiana. If we
            would provide a Surrogate Court we would increase the expenses of the Judicial system.
            The judges of the Circuit Courts, with the small circuits provided for, would be able to
            discharge all the duties required of them, and there would be no need of Surrogate
            Courts. The proceedings would thus be simplified; there would be but one set of records,
            and the system would be less expensive. When gentlemen desire to examine the records for
            a judgment they would have to examine but one set of books. If we can make our courts
            plainer and more simple than the courts of other States, and at the same time ample to
            discharge their duties, we ought to do it. Under this bill we have a plain system that
            any man can understand, and the judge will have time to discharge the duties of his
            office. I think we ought to abolish the Common Pleas.</p>
          <p>Mr. O'BRIEN. Like the Senator from Putnam (Mr. Daggy) I do not know whether I am
            prepared to vote for abolishing the Common Pleas or not. I will say I am not prepared to
            vote for it till I see a better substitute. There certainly can be but two objects in
            changing the judicial system - the first would be to make it more efficient, and the
            second to make it more economical. This bill as at present arranged I think does neither
            - it is neither more efficient nor more economical, but on the contrary it is less
            efficient and more expensive. I cannot vote for this bill unless it is materially
            modified. I don't care what you call the court so it is efficient and not too expensive.
            In the Circuit where I live, composed of three counties, we have now fifty-five weeks in
            the year, This bill proposes to give thirty-three in lieu of fifty-five; and I say to
            this Senate there is no Judge living can do the business in that time and do it well. A
            Senator says we must increase the salaries of our Circuit Judges. I grant the salary is
            too small and so it is with the Common Pleas Judges. But as a measure of economy this
            bill proposes to transfer the Common Pleas business to a Judge with a salary of $3000 or
            $3500 a year, while we are now getting it done for $1500. This bill proposes four terms
            during the year and with that a grand jury. At the last Spring term in our county the
            cost of the Grand Jury was $1200. Under this bill they would draw $4800 for the Circuit
            Court. That, with the increase of the salaries of judges, will more than double the
            expense of litigation. What argument is there in favor of this new system? It is an easy
            matter to abolish judges, but what will you substitute for it? Is there any economy in
            increasing the terms of the Circuit Courts the most expensive court we have? The great
            difficulty in all our courts is that we have criminal business mixed up with civil, and
            that ruins our civil litigation. If we could get that separate it would relieve us
            greatly. If we can adopt some system that will separate our business we can then
            systemize it, otherwise I see nothing that will. I favor the substitute as being a
            measure in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Mr. BOONE. I am not in favor of abolishing the Common Pleas Court yet. I know
            gentlemen, young ones in particular, can without much difficulty find fault with the
            provisions that are made for carrying forward the business of the country. It is very
            easy to find fault. It happens that I have had something to do with the courts ever
            since the organization of the Common Pleas Courts in Indiana, and as far as my knowledge
            extends, people who have had business transacted in it make but little complaint. The
            argument that the records are cumberous does not meet the question. It is not true that
            it takes more records when the business is divided than if the same business were
            transacted by one court. The same amount of record would have to be made, though not in
            two separate volumes. It is contended that the Circuit Judges have an equal amount of
            ability with Common Pleas Judges, but it is a known fact to gentlemen, not lawyers even,
            that a division of labor makes success. So it is with regard to business in the courts.
            The difficulty now which calls out anathemas against the Common Pleas is the
            conglomeration of civil, criminal and probate business in the same court. The probate
            business does not go to the Circuit Court except in cases where the Common Pleas Judge
            is interested. Even with this division which is partial only, it is contended that the
            courts are inefficient. Then inefficiency is not on account of the fact that there are
            two Judges, but because the business is not divided as it should be. The entire
            commercial world is divided that it may be efficient It is no less true of the bnsinew
            entrusted to Judges. You put all this diverse business in the hands of one judge, and it
            requires a versatility of talent and ability <pb n="421" xml:id="VAA8558-14-421"/> not
            necessary now because the business is divided. I am not ready to dispense with the
            Common Pleas Courts, certainly till we know of something that is better. There is no
            necessity of giving up that which, we know and fly to evils we know not of. It is
            contended that by this bill you will decrease the expenses of court business. That is
            not true; and if this system is adopted, next session will not pass over our heads
            before there will be loud cries from all parts of the State for County Judges or
            Surrogate Courts, or something that will result in the end more costly than the present
            system.</p>
          <p>Gentlemen who live in localities that have Criminal Courts which separates that from
            the civil business, say this Common Pleas system is a nuisance. Perhaps that comes from
            the fast that they have their criminal business taken out of the way, and they have
            their civil business divided. Criminals find this city and Lafayette and other places
            where there are Criminal Courts too hot for their residence, and the effect is they run
            to the adjacent county like rats from a sinking ship, to commit their depredations where
            the courts meet but once every three or four months, and they have an opportunity to
            break jails, and suborn witnesses or run them out of the country. In localities where
            they are not situated as we are - where they are remote from cities, perhaps it would be
            effectual, but with us it is not so. By this bill it is proposed to give us sixteen
            weeks in our county. We now have thirteen weeks and two terms, and are behind, and if we
            should be so unfortunate as to have a Clem trial or two I don't know as our civil cases
            would ever see the light. I see the Judge in the Senate chamber now; and it seems
            impossible, after holding two months of an adjourned term to keep up with the business
            on account of the conglomeration of this civil and criminal billing. I am not ready to
            abolish the Common Pleas system until I see a better and a cheaper system. I would vote
            for a system to divide the business making one court for civil business exclusively and
            another for civil business. I don't propose to enter into this discussion more fully as
            to this great importance of the division of the civil and criminal practice. In the
            early history of this State when the amount of criminal business was but small and the
            amount of civil business smaller, it made but little difference whether you had the two
            together in one court or separate; but now the counties and districts are thickly
            populated, and to protect the smaller towns against the depredations of these
            scoundrels, it is necessary that they should have separate criminal courts.</p>
          <p>Mr. BROWN said he thought the best remedy for the evil of which the gentleman from
            Boone [Mr. Boone] complained was to abolish the Common Pleas Court, and transfer the
            criminal business to those courts which will sit three or four times a year. This will
            insure speedy justice, and relieve the counties of the expense of boarding criminals for
            six or eight months, or a year, before they could be tried. The Common Pleas Courts were
            originally established as probate courts. But the aspiring judges thought their
            jurisdiction ought to be enlarged, and from time to time appealed to legislation until
            now they are nisi prius courts of almost equal jurisdiction with the circuit courts.
            Thus we have the anomaly of two nisi prius courts traveling around among the people
            transacting the same business, with no appeal from one to the other. And it has come to
            pass that the probate business, for the careful transaction of which Common Pleas courts
            were originally created, has fallen almost exclusively into the hands of the lawyers and
            the clerks of the courts ; the judges being too much occupied with cases in litigation
            to give their personal attention to the settlement of estates. In his district it rarely
            happened that an estate of $1,000 was settled in less than five years. So the Common
            Pleas Courts have become inefficient for the transaction of the business for which they
            were primarily created and unnecessary for the transaction of other business. If the
            circuits are made smaller and the number of terms increased, the circuit courts would be
            competent to attend to all business except probate, and he hoped that courts would be
            established to whom that business would be exclusively committed.</p>
          <p>The Committee then rose, reported progress and asked leave to sit again at 2 P. M. And
            the Senate took a recess.</p>
          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
            <p>The Senate reassembled at 2 o'clock, the Lieutenant Governor in the chair, and
              immediately resolved itself into a <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName> and
              resumed the consideration of the Joint Committee's bill [S. 238] for a division of the
              State for judicial purposes, Mr. Dwiggins again in the chair.</p>
            <p>Mr. GLESSNER said complaints came up from all parts of the State that the present
              judicial system is inefficient and inadequate to meet the necessities of the people. A
              reformation is certainly needed, and in his opinion the first step in that direction
              is the abolition of the Common Pleas Courts, whose existence gives rise to confusion
              and embarrrassment. The arguments urged against the bill had reference to the
              provisions of the bill in detail, but did not effect the principle which it embodied.
              If the districts are not properly arranged; or if the terms of courts provided for
              them are too <pb n="422" xml:id="VAA8558-14-422"/> long or loo short, these defects
              can easily be remedied. To the principle of the bill he believed no valid objection
              could be taken.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE said the reasons presented for the passage of the bill were not so cogent
              as to convince him of the necessity for taking this step in a hurry. He could not see
              why the Common Pleas Court should be abolished until a better system is found. One
              gentleman said they proposed that the Circuit Courts should do all the business now
              done by other courts. Another proposes that another Judge shall be created to be
              called Common Pleas or Probate, or Surrogate, or by some other name. He agreed that
              the business should be separated, that the Common Pleas Judge should have jurisdiction
              of probate business and nothing else. He would have their circuits made larger and
              confine them to probate business. In this way, quite a large number of them could be
              dispensed with, and what is saved in that way may be given to the Circuit Courts. If
              the probate business is intrusted to the Circuit Judges it will always lag behind. The
              Judge will not reach it until about the end of the term, when he is fagged out with
              the attending to the trial of cases, and he will call some lawyer to attend to it for
              him. If this business is committed to a particular court, and its jurisdiction
              confined to that, the judges will become familiar with the business, and it will be
              transacted more promptly and more intelligently than by any other system. It is
              suggested that we may establish a County Surrogate, and his salary is estimated at
              $1,000 per annum. As there are 92 counties in the fetate, that alone would amount to
              $92,000, nearly double what is now paid to the Common Pleas Judges. It is evident that
              this question should be very carefully considered by every Senator, and time should be
              given to mature the plans. It would be far better to take no action for the present
              than to adopt a doubtful system. He therefore favored the reference to a special
              committee.</p>
            <p>Mr. DAGGY'S amendment to Mr. Rhodes' substitute, to strike out the Common Pleas
              Courts, was lost.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN moved to ptrike out the word "territorial" from the substitute, so as to
              instruct the committee to make such changes in the number and jurisdiction of the
              Common Pleas Courts as may be necessary.</p>
            <p>Mr. GLESSNER moved to amend the amendment by striking out all of the instructions.

          <p>he SPEAKER announced the special order, viz : the consideration of Mr. Thayer's bill
            [H. R. 303] for an act to amend sections 2 and 6 of the act providing for a Geological
            survey and for the collection and preservation of a geological and chemical cabinet of
            the Natural History of the State, creating the office of State Geologist, defining his
            duties and fixing his salary, and making appropriations for the same, approved March 5,
            1869the question being on the pending amendment: Mr. Miller's amendment for striking out
            the $10,000 total appropriation and inserting $6,000 in lieu; and Mr. Gregory's
            amendment for striking put the $3,600 salary of the Geologist and inserting $2,500 in
            lieu.</p>
          <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH was unmilling to incur additional expense as to the survey, but would
            increase the salary of the Geologist. He did not think the interests of the State
            demanded an extensive Geological Survey.</p>
          <p>Mr. RENO. After giving this subject the most careful consideration, I think it would be
            unwise to cut down the compensation of Prof. Cox at this time. We never reapt the
            benefit of those immense mines of coal till the discoveries of science and scientific
            men draw the capital to our State to work them. Therefore I think it is economy to grant
            what Prof. Cox asks for in this bill. It is certainly to the interest of the people of
            the State to make this appropriation. It has been said that this is a local matter, but
            I can't see it in that light; for anything that increases the wealth and prosperity of
            the State certainly helps every tax-payer of the Slate. If, through the reports of
            scientific men like Prof. Cox, capitalists can be induced to bring their capital into
            the State to the amount of millions, will it not help the tax-payer? It is childish to
            talk of local benefits in this connection. If the city of Indianapolis were to grow
            rapidly into a city of 200,000 population, in connection with the development of our
            coal and iron I should rejoice at it, as I would rejoice at the increase of the taxable
            property of the State, and every farmer of the State would share in such a local
            prosperity; for then, under a just and economical administration of our affairs, we
            might reduce the taxes. We passed a bill here but the other day appropriating $24,000 to
            enclose the Tippecanoe Battle ground, which benefits nobody, and we passed it without
            grudging; yet now, when Prof. Cox asks for this appropriation of $10,000 which is to
            increase the taxable property of the State, we are higgling about it. I think, sir, that
            the manufacturing interest of the State has received a very palpable impulsion by the
            labors of Prof. Cox. I think we <pb n="424" xml:id="VAA8558-14-424"/> should show a
            liberal hand in fostering science by sustaining the State Geologist, and so through the
            enlargement and the increase of the number of our manufactories, we will have before
            long a market for our produce at home - for every pound of pork and every bushel of
            grain we can produce. Sir, I would be willing to vote $20,000 for this purpose.</p>
          <p>Mr. GREGORY. I am advised that the Geologist will be satisfied with a salary of $2,500,
            and that he can run the machinery of his office with a total appropriation of $8,000;
            and I wish to send this up and offer it as a substitute for the other amendment.</p>
          <p>The SPEAKER. It can not be offered now.</p>
          <p>Mr. GREGORY. It is the opinion of the State Geologist that $8,000 will answer, and that
            a salary of $2,500 will do him. It seems to me that amount should be sufficient here.
            There is no question but there ought to be an appropriation for the purpose of operating
            the machinery of this office and giving it encouragement. The only real question then is
            what amount should be paid to the Geologist ? and if I am correctly informed $2,500 will
            be sufficient for him ; and if not, when the next Legislature shall convene they can
            give him a compensation commenserate with his labors.</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT. The gentleman from Owen (Mr. Reno) speaks in opposition to cutting down
            the salary and the appropriation. I believe that, at present, the appropriation is
            $5,000 and the salary $1,800 - </p>
          <p>Mr. KIMBALL interposing. The salary of $1,800 is deducted from the appropriation of
            $5,000.</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT continuing - and the proposition before the House is to increase that
            appropriation. This is a liberal House of Representatives, but to pass this proposition
            as it stands would be a little more liberal than we have been yet. It would be simply
            multiplying the salary and the appropriation by two. We surely can be allowed to inquire
            whether this is not a little too strong. I think that probably a more prudent measure
            would be adopt the amendment which makes the salary $2,500, which is $500 more than we
            pay the President of the State University, and $1,000 more than we pay any professor in
            that University. The bill then would both increase the salary of the Geologist and give
            him a larger fund for extending his surveys.</p>
          <p>Mr. NORTH. I think the gentleman from White (Mr. Gregory) was certainly mistaken when
            he said Prof. Cox would be satisfied with $2,500. I have myself talked with the
            Professor on the matter, and I think he must certainly be mistaken in regard to it.</p>
          <p>Mr. GREGORY. I got the information from a member of this House who thought he was
            correct. But I have since been informed from the Professor himself that he can't get
            along with less than $8,000.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. I was glad to hear the gentleman from St. Joseph (Mr. Butterworth)
            modifying some statements which he was pleased to make the other day - he having
            probably come into possession of facts which he had not before. The gentleman should
            keep pace with the State Geologist who has been occupying his position for some years,
            developing the resources of the State and advertising them to the world. There is
            another fact which I have gathered, not from the Professor himself but from
            disinterested parties, that Mr. Cox has expended in this work some five or six thousand
            dollars of his own private funds - nearer six thousand than five thousand. I said the
            other day $2,500 is a good salary, but I would now vote for a salary of $3,000. I did
            not say then, and I do not say now, that $10,000 is too large an estimate. I do not
            think it is. I think it bad policy for us to stint this department, because now it needs
            nursing and nourishing with a liberal hand. I am sure the House is willing to extend to
            it the support it deserves. I am willing, I say, to give the salary of $3,000. I have
            been informed from a source that leaves not the slightest doubt in my mind of the fact,
            that offers have been extended to Prof. Cox from Kentucky, to leave here and go there on
            a salary even better than what we are proposing to pay him in this bill. But he has
            declined because he has been sometime in Indiana and has become thoroughly acquainted
            with the resources of the State, the manner of their development, and he is so wedded to
            her interests that he remains here, when he might do better outside; and it must be
            admitted that it would not be exactly fair in us to ask him to stay since he has been
            offered more. I would not cut down the appropriation of $10,000. The bill is well
            guarded; and, in the hands of the State Board of Agriculture the money will be well
            expended,it is well guarded and well considered in every sentence of it. I hope the
            appropriation will not be cut down, for it is no more than fair, as I think - no more
            than an honest, equal appropriation for much needed services.</p>
          <p>Mr. LENFESTY. I desire to say a word in reference to this matter. In the first place, I
            do not desire to be considered at all penurious in reference to the compensation of our
            public officers. I can say that the State Geologist has done a great work for the State.
            But, in view of the fact that we are called upon to pay out money in so many directions
            - in view of the <pb n="425" xml:id="VAA8558-14-425"/> tact that our benevolent
            institutions are suffering - our Insane Asylum is almost nothing in comparison with what
            it should be, - I am compelled to think that $2,500 should be sufficient for the salary.
            We can't expect to pay any public officer an amount in money equivalent to the amount of
            benefit he is expected to confer on the State; and there is no reason why we should
            compensate a public officer for all the benefits of his labors. I am in favor of giving
            to all our public officers a just compensation; and when we come to raise a salary from
            eighteen hundred dollars to twenty-five hundred dollars it is liberal; and as for the
            total appropriation - eight thousand dollars for salary and office expenses, I think
            that should be sufficient - leaving to the Geologist five thousand five hundred dollars
            for the expenses of his office. It may be that in two years from now this should be
            increased , and then I might be in favor of increasing this appropriation gradually. We
            have shown a very liberal spirit here - beginning with the members of the General
            Assembly, and going from the Governor to the Judges, but I believe this should proceed
            gradually.</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT. I desire to move for a division of the question : to proceed to vote first
            on the amount we will substitute for the ten thousand dollars.</p>
          <p> The SPEAKER. There will be a division of the question.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. This amendment can not be divided.</p>
          <p>The SPEAKER. The first question will be: Will the House strike out the ten thousand
            dollars?</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. Suppose we fix first the amount we will pay the Professor; my own
            conviction is that we should retain the three thousand dollars. I think if the office is
            not worth that we had better abolish it. When we shall have fixed that, then I would be
            willing to give an increased amount for the additional work of a Geologist. But I am
            opposed to giving ten thousand dollars. If it would be proper I would move that we fix
            the salary of the Professor at three thousand dollars. I want to get a direct vote on
            the salary.</p>
          <p>The SPEAKER. The first question will be on the striking out ten thousand dollars.</p>
          <p>Mr. RENO. We have a great many scientific men in the State of Indiana, but we have only
            one Professor Cox; and as the Professor desires this sum in order that he may carry out
            his Geological work for the State, I believe it is our duty to allow it; and I shall
            vote to retain that sum both as a matter of duty and a matter of courtesy to a faithful
            public officer; and I think it is reasonable.</p>
          <p>Mr. KIMBALL. I have said that this ten thousand dollars is to include the salary of the
            Professor; and the argument against the proposed salary has been made in this way : that
            we give the President of the State University, his professors, the judges of the courts
            but a meager compensation compared with what is here proposed for the State Geologist.
            But there are many incompetent judges, and many lawyers who are anxious to become
            judges, which is a consideration that cannot be urged against the Geologist.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN interposing with a question of order: The question is on the striking out
            the $10,000.</p>
          <p>Mr. KIMBALL; I thought I might strike some lawyer ; and may be the gentleman wants to
            be a judge too. But I will make this statement, that out of the vast number of lawyers
            who might make good judges it might be hard to find even one that would make a fair
            State Geologist. Now we pay this man on account of his knowledge, and for directing the
            attention of capitalists to those mineral deposits which his investigations have shown
            to be superior to any in the world ; whilst, by increasing the salaries of the judges,
            you only increase the development of crime. [Laughter.] But joking aside,looking back
            ten years, and seeing the millions of wealth that have been added to the State of
            Indiana by the researches of this State Geologist, and comparing it with any good result
            for the material benefit of the State growing out of any thing that has been done by all
            the judges, or even by the Governor of the State for that period, and the comparison is
            odious.</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT interposing. Does the gentleman attribute all the success that has attended
            the business of the State of Indiana to the State Geologist?</p>
          <p>Mr. KIMBALL. Not all of it; but I attribute very much of it to the advertisements which
            have been given to the world of our great resources by the State Geologist. The trouble
            was that we had not the capital; and capital came to the districts where the latent
            wealth was determined,and labor followed the capital; so that labor has benefitted the
            State by the coming in of the capital, which would not have come had it not been for the
            State Geologist. The State Geologist has made known to the civilized nations of the
            earth the superiority of the coal of Indiana for the manufacture of iron and steel, and
            that has given us a prominence above all other regions. And if our legislation shall be
            of such a character as will look to the future greatness of the State in this respect,
            instead of looking at the immediate expense of our geological surveys, the General
            Assembly will accomplish a good public work, <pb n="426" xml:id="VAA8558-14-426"/> not
            only for themselves but for generations to come, and though I may be charged with voting
            away the State's money wastefully, I thank God that I can stand here and do it for the
            honor and prosperity of the State. I cannot say that it is unnecessary to carry on these
            geological surveys further; for we have been confined to a few counties heretofore, and
            we want to survey the whole State. Some twenty-five years ago it was known that there
            was coal and iron in the State; but what good did that do? It was not until the State
            took it upon herself to organize an agricultural department, and to add the Geologist,
            that any good result followed from this knowledge. It was not until it was developed in
            those localities where our minerals existed, that the coal there had a peculiar value
            for the manufacture of iron and steel, that our iron ore was also superior, and hence
            the superiority of our State in these respects, and the importance of giving a knowledge
            of these facts to mankind. I can remember the time when land could be bought in these
            mineral counties from fifty cents to five dollars per acre, and new you can't buy the
            same lands for one hundred dollars per acre; and the whole region is marked by
            railroads. I can remember the time too, when the State of Indiana did not furnish one
            hundred bushels of coal annually to Indianapolis ; but now we send every year acres of
            coal to Chicago and Louisville and all this has been brought about by the labors and
            researches of the State Geologist Now, sir, it is proper that this man should be
            compensated at a reasonable rate, and that he should be enabled to push his
            investigations.</p>
          <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH. I have been much pleased with the speech of the gentleman from Marion
            (Mr. Kimball) and would be willing to subscribe to it as my own. I suppose that my own
            county is as prosperous as any in the State - conceding every thing that has been said
            about the prosperity of the coal region ; but I cannot acknowledge here that to the
            Geologist of the State, or to any other man, can be attributed all this prosperity. If
            the Geologist had been stricken by lightning, the State would still have gone on
            prosperously. My sentiment is this: I say, down with all pretentious for increasing the
            salaries. It is an easy tfiing to increase the salaries, but it is hard to cut them
            down. Besides this, we have now a fluctuating currency; and when it comes down to solid
            business, it will break up many seemingly solid men and jostle public measures. Then let
            us go slow - let us at least do this: let us down with the practice of increasing the
            salaries. If we had plenty of money and a stable currency I might agree with gentlemen
            who desire this in creased appropriation. I confess that the interest of one part of the
            State is the interest of all, the development of the resources and the prosperity of the
            center of the State is the pride of the entire State of Indiana, but we can't afford
            this thing, sir, and I think we should here take our stand, and declare that we are not
            going into a general increase of the salaries at this time.</p>

            appropriation to extend only to the next two years; and that will leave to the next
            Legislature the discretion and the power to increase it. It might be a very easy matter
            for us to pass this for an annual appropriation, but it is not always an easy matter to
            repeal a law. It is for that reason that I make this proposition.</p>

            <p>On the motion of Mr. FURNAS, the order of business was suspended, and the House took
              up the consideration of Mr. Butts' Local Option Temperance bill [H. R. 327] entitled
              "a bill for an act to regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors, to provide against
              the evils resulting from any sale thereof, to furnish remedies for damages suffered by
              any person in consequence of such sale, prescribing penalties, to repeal all laws

            <p>The motion was agreed to, and the bill, as amended was read through by the clerk.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCHMUCK - See his remarks on pages 127 and 128.</p>
            <p>Mr. BUTTS. Mr. Speaker: The subject of intemperance is one of very great importance,
              and is certainly the towering and gigantic evil of our land. It opens before us a
              wide-spread field of thought - a field that is watered by the crimson streams of
              humane gore and decked by the graves of fallen victims. It is constantly spreading
              devastation, misery and wretchedness throughout the length and breadth of our country,
              and its poisonous streams by its deep current are cutting their way through the vitals
              of our race. It is carrying upon its bosom the destructive elements of sin in all of
              its various forms and phases. It is another form of slavery, that is binding by its
              oppressive yoke and chrushing by its strong arms thousands of our noble and
              free-hearted citizens. If you open the dark pages of history, upon which is recorded
              the various evils of intemperance and the effects of its many crimes, the whole earth
              would be darkened and the broad canopy of heaven shrouded in mourning. Almost every
              day that we live we are called upon, in some form, to take immediate and continued
              action in endeavoring to suppress this great and destructive evil. It has created
              among us a history of corruption, of shame, and of crime. It is daily taking the bloom
              of health from the face and in its stead placing the reddish hue of the intoxicating
              bowl. It is constantly destroying the peace and happiness of families, and in its
              stead placing desolation, misery and ruin. It maddens the brain of the husband and
              father; and makes him a tyrant and a murderer. It darkens the pathway of a kind <pb
                n="428" xml:id="VAA8558-14-428"/> and affectionate mother, and makes her an object
              of sorrow and despair. It dethrones reason and transforms this body, so fearfully and
              wonderfully made the workmanship of God's own hand - into a loathsome and reckless
              mass of humanity. It is filling our streets with violence, crowding our courts with
              criminal cases, filling our jails and penitentiaries with criminals, our poor houses
              with paupers, our insane asylums with inebriates. It is stripping men of their wealth
              and clothing them with poverty and shame, turning the endearing and gladsome pleasures
              of home into a place of desolation, of weeping eyes and throbbing hearts. It has been
              asserted that it produces at least one-half of all the insanity, three-fourths of the
              pauperism, and four-fifths of all the crime in our land, and at a cost of about three
              million dollars per day. Indiana, our own State, pays annually for drams sixty-one
              million two hundred and eighty thousand dollars. This sum would he sufficient alone to
              build about 18 universities in each county in the State. The one hundred thousand
              imprisonments, the one hundred thousand suicides that occur annually, the two hundred
              thousand children that are made worse than orphans, the two million that are deprived
              of the privileges of an education, the three million tipplers, the six hundred
              thousand confirmed drunkards, and the sixty thousand of our citizens who die annually,
              are all examples, teaching us the great importance and absolute necessity of a more
              stringent legislation on this subject. Are we not ready, as the law-making power of
              this State, to take hold of this growing and overwhelming evil. Suppose, Mr. Speaker,
              that some one was to establish a slaughter house, a soap factory, or starch factory in
              the city of Indianapolis. How long would it be before the City Council or Mayor would
              go to such person and say to him, that "My friend, you must remove your place of
              business out of the city?" Your business is destroying the health and comfort of the
              people, and the law will not allow you to engage in a business where it will effect
              the health and comfort of the citizens. The same rule will hold good with any business
              or act that effects the health of the people. It is declared as a nuisance and is
              subject to the provisions of the law. Why is it that the whiskey traffic is an
              exception to the general law? It reaches directly or indirectly to the fireside of
              almost every family, carrying with it the most bitter cup. It affects the health,
              disturbs the peace, destroys the happiness and comfort of the people in nearly every
              city, town or neighborhood in the entire land. In fact it lifts its towering and
              gigantic form of misery and wretchedness and ruin above all the evils in the known
              world.</p>
            <p>Men have been committing murder and theft for these thousand of years and still we
              continue to legislate against these evils. Here is an evil that lies at the very
              foundation of nearly all the crime in our land; is it not right and shall we not
              continue to legislate against this wrong until we shall have placed it beneath our
              feet ? The poor unfortunate one who falls into the channel of becoming intoxicated
              commits at least a three fold murder. 1. He kills time. The golden moments that have
              been given him that he may be a blessing not only to himself but to all around him and
              that he may prepare in this life to enjoy a better and happier one, he spends in a
              state of insensibility under the influence of a poisonous liquid. 2d. He kills
              himself. He destroys that manly frame whose builder and maker is God. The face that
              once gave evidence of a light and glad heart is now carrying the mark of sorrow, pain
              and wretchedness, and the manly frame sinks down, down, beneath the effects of the
              deadly demon. 3d. He kills his own precious soul. He extends the slow, but sure, work
              of destruction to the very depths of his immortality. The spirit which is to live on
              when time ceases to move, and when the sun refuses to shine, and was given to glorify
              its Maker is made to sink so low as to curse even the day of its birth. Instead of
              enjoying home, friends and friendly associations his mind is actively engaged in the
              many devices of sin - learning the most successful route to perdition and ruin,
              although his name might have been written in the Lamb's book of life. No drunkard,
              saith the Scriptures, shall inherit the kingdom of heaven. Jeremy Taylor has well and
              truthfully said that temperance is reason's girdle and passion's bridle - the strength
              of the soul and the foundation of virtue.</p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, there are to-day in the State of Indiana two thousand one hundred and
              sixty five, engaged in the sale of intoxicating liquors, who are licensed by law to
              deal out this poisonous and destructive liquid to their fellow men, while there are
              hundreds of others indirectly engaged in the same work of destruction, carrying before
              them the most powerful wave of sorrow and pain. These men will stand behind their
              counter and deal out this poisonous draught until they have extracted the very last
              cent from the poor man's purse, and sent the poor, unfortunate victim into the streets
              staggering, without money and without reason. How many children are there to-day
              scattered all over our land who ask the poor, unfortunate father in vain for bread ?
              How many to day who have not <pb n="429" xml:id="VAA8558-14-429"/>clothes to protect
              them from the cold and thrilling blast of winter, simply because the father had spent
              his hard-earned money for the intoxicating draught ? How many wives to-day whose
              pillows are but too often bathed in tears from the effect of the whisky traffic, and
              whose prayers have ascended, no doubt to the Most High for relief? Thousands of
              petitions have been sent to this honorable body praying for a strong temperance law to
              relieve them from this tyrant wrong, waiting patiently to hear our action. The people
              are not only suffering by the effects of this traffic upon society, but they are
              burdened heavily with taxes growing out of cases caused by this evil. Mr. Speaker and
              Gentlemen of the House, we ought to do something on this great question of wrong, and
              do it without delay. We ought to take hold of this monster evil, and by the strong arm
              of the law stop as far as possible its destruction among our people. Other States,
              Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Ohio, Illinoise, and others, have felt the weight
              and power of this growing evil, and have passed laws to prohibit its ever widening
              path of destruction. Indiana can not afford to fall behind. The bill we have
              recommended is, with a few exceptions, no new work of legislation. It has proved
              satisfactory in other States, and I see no good reason why it will not in ours. The
              local option law has recently been adopted in Philadelphia. From a correspondent we
              have the following: "Our State seems to have solved, in a practical and satisfactory
              manner, the long pending and thoroughly perplexing temperance problem. Local option,
              or giving the people of wards and townships the exclusive right to prohibit the
              vending of intoxicating liquors within their respective localities, seems to have hit
              the happy means needed to strengthen the temperance cause. On a very brief trial it
              has worked so well here that it has already been favorably indorsed and adopted by the
              combined temperance organizations of the State of New York." I hope Mr. Speaker, that
              every member of this House will feel it his duty to vote for this bill. I believe that
              by so doing you will cause many a dark and dreary home to be a home of sunshine, love
              and happiness. You will by this act of your life carry tidings of joy, of comfort and
              peace to the fireside of many brokenhearted and sorrowing families. You will give
              bread to the hungry and clothes to the naked; and this Legislature will be held long
              in rememberance by the kind good wishes of a grateful people. Mr. Speaker, I earnestly
              hope the bill will pass. The people are demanding it. The welfare and prosperty of our
              State demand it. The happiness and comfort of our people demand it. The fact that so
              many precious souls are being lost in eternity is a sufficient reason that we should
              give it our earnest support.</p>
            <p>Mr. FURNAS. I hope the House will proceed to the vote without a demand for the
              previous question.</p>
            <p>Mr. BLOCHER submitted a motion for adjournment which was rejected without a
              division.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY demanded a call of the House to bring in the absentees.</p>
            <p>The call proceeded, and was dispensed with when a satisfactory quorum had been
              determined - eighty nine members responding.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. BAKER, the bill was again considered as engrossed and put upon its
              passage</p>
            <p>The Clerk reported - yeas 53, nays 36, on the final passage of the bill, as follows:
              - See page 128.</p>
            <p>So the bill passed the House of Representatives, and then, when Mr. Butts' motion to
              reconsider this vote was laid on the table by his own motion, the House took a recess
              till two o'clock P. M.</p>

            <head rend="center">CITY SCHOOL TRUSTEES.</head>
            <head rend="center">[CONTINUED FROM PAGE 132BOTTOM OF FIRST COLUMN.]</head>
            <p>The bill [H. R. 155] To provide that School Trustees shall be elected by the people
              in cities of eight thousand or more inhabitants instead of by the City Council, which
              was the special order for 10:30 o'clock was called up by Mr. Scott.</p>
            <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN said this bill proposed to make a radical change in the common
              school system, and he thought it ought to be carefully investigated. What is the
              necessity for the change? The present system has worked well and satisfactorily
              throughout the State, except perhaps in one instance. In the county of Wayne a few men
              have had a difficulty with their local Trustees, and this bill was framed to enable
              them to get rid of them. The Senator from Wayne presented a remonstrance against the
              passage of the bill much more numerously signed than the petition for ite passage. Mr.
              S. believed if this election was thrown into the hands of the people inferior men
              would be elected, because <pb n="431" xml:id="VAA8558-14-431"/> the men best fitted
              for the position would not engage in the struggle. All the local questions and the
              political differences and sectarian feeling would enter in to embitter the feelings of
              the people and restrain capable and competent and reputable men from entering the
              field. Mr. S. said: probably the most competent man for shool trustee in our county is
              Mr. who is such a modest man that he never would allow his name to be used as a
              candidate by either party, but he has been elected and re-elected from year to year. A
              member of the school board of the city of Fort Wayne, some twelve years ago had a seat
              on this floor and has been a prominent member of the Senate. Since that time he has
              retired entirely from politics, and he cannot be induced to take a political position,
              but he considers it a pleasure as well as an honor to serve on the Board of School
              Trustees. And you can find similar cases in almost all the large cities of the State.
              If the bill before the Senate should prevail the result would be that such men would
              not be elected because you could not, separate the election of school trustees from
              politics; and the result will be that another avenue will be opened to the
              introduction of politics in our public school management, and in the election of
              school trustees. In one ward the churches, in another ward politics, and in another
              ward local interests will be felt;Republican wards will not elect Democrats, and visi
              versa. There will be party issues made in the election of school trustees - you cannot
              avoid it because you cannot separate the election. Under the present law our school
              trustees are elected independent of such influences, at least such is the case so far
              as my knowledge and experience goes. We are told that the principle of the bill now
              pending is in force in cities of more than thirty thousand inhabitants. That is for
              the city of Indianapolis, only. I know the school law was changed two years ago for
              the great city of Indianapolis, but I am willing to believe it was for local reasons;
              and as I remember it met with no opposition at that time. And even if the law should
              give satisfaction here it is by no means certain it would work in the same way in
              other places. And I am entirely unwilling to vote away a system known by experience to
              try a doubtful experiment. In the light before me now, Mr. President it is my honest
              opinion that the law ought not to be changed, and therefore I move that the report of
              the Committee be amended by - </p>
            <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr Brown in the Chair.] It cannot be amended unless the vote
              concurring in the report be reconsidered.</p>
            <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN. I am of opinion that the report was not concurred in. Senator from
              Kosciusko [Mr. Chapman,] made the remark that the minority report could not be
              concurred in, but only could come up as a substitute for the majority report.</p>
            <p>On motion by, Mr. CHAPMAN the vote was reconsidered by which the majority report of
              the Committee on Education, recommending the passage of the bill was concurred in.</p>
            <p>Mr. CHAPMAN then moved that the report of the committee be amended by substituting
              for the majority report, the minority report, which recommends that he bill be laid on
              the table. The yeas and nays being demanded and being ordered and taken - The vote

            <head rend="center">TERRE HAUTE AND INDIANAPOLIS RAILROAD AND THE SCHOOL FUND.</head>
            <p>Mr. BROWN, from the Committee on Railroads, asked and obtained leave to submit a
              report in relation to the alleged failure of the Terre Haute and Indianapolis Railroad
              Company to pay over surplus profits to the school fund as required by its charter.The
              report sets forth that the committee took all the evidence which they reasonably could
              in the time allowed them. The officers of the company afforded them every facility to
              enable them to obtain the facts. They reported that said company has at all times,
              when called upon by the proper authorities, made full and complete reports in
              accordance with the 23d section of their charter. In the investigations made the
              committee found no evidence of corruption, concealment or fraud in the matter of the
              said company's relations and obligations to the State.</p>
            <pb n="432" xml:id="VAA8558-14-432"/>
            <p>The committee further report that the evidence shows that the reasons upon which the
              officers of the company act in failing to pay over any sum of money to the Treasurer
              of the State as a part of the earnings for the benefit of the common school fund are
              these: first, Said officers claim and insist that there is nothing due under any
              circumstances. Second, Acting under the advice and council of their attorneys, Hon. R.
              W. Thompson, J. P. Baird, Messrs. Porter, Harrison &amp; Hines and Maj. J. W. Gordon,
              the officers of the company claim and insist that nothing can be due to the State, or
              any funds thereof, until the Legislature first asserts the right of the State in the
              premises, and by legislation fixes and regulates the tolls and freights and income of
              said company. They claim that they have been strengthened by the opinion of the
              Attorney General of the State, dated April 29, 1869, and which, in the judgment of the
              committee, coincides with the views and opinions of the Company's attorneys. It is
              insisted, however, by the attorneys who claim to represent the State, together with
              the Attorney General, that no such precedent steps are necessary in order to fix the
              liability of the Company, but that the Company is bound to pay over without any action
              by the Legislature.</p>
            <p>The solution of this question depends upon the construction which is put on the 22d,
              23d, and 24th, sections of this charter of the Company. The Company claim that by the
              22d, section it has a perfect right to charge and receive such freights as shall be
              for the interest of the Company, and that the only limitation upon this right is
              contained in the 23d, section, which provides that when the aggregate amount of
              dividends declared shall amount to the full sum invested and 10 per cent per annum
              thereon, the Legislature may so regulate the tolls and freights that no more than
              fifteen per cent, shall be divided, and the surplus profits, if any, after paying the
              expenses and reserving a fund for contingencies, shall be paid over to the Treasurer
              of State for the use of common schools. They argue that all the earnings of the road
              belong solely to the corporation until the State has first asserted her right to the
              surplus profits by the regulation of the tolls and freights. This is purely a legal
              question, and a suit is pending, which will probably be decided this month, which
              involves this question.</p>
            <p>If the construction put on the sections of the charter by the company and the
              ex-Attorney General is not correct, and the State has a right to claim that no
              precedent legislation is necessary, is there, in reality, any thing due to the common
              school fund? We find from the evidence that if there is any thing due it grows mainly
              out of the Company's having diverted the earnings of the road, which would otherwise
              have been dividends for the purpose of subscribing for stock and purchasing bonds of
              other railroad companies to enable such Companies to complete railroads forming a
              connection with the road of said company. The officers of the Company insist that they
              have the right to do so. The attorneys claiming to represent the State insist that the
              corporation has no such right. So another legal question is raised which should be
              decided by the judiciary. The officers of the road insist that if such investment had
              proved a total loss, the investment increased the business and dividends of the road,
              and thus enured to the benefit of the school fund by enabling the Company to get back
              sooner its investment and put the State in a condition sooner to regulate the tolls
              and freights. Both parties claim that the committee have not all the evidence on that
              subject.</p>
            <p>The committee further report that the Hon. James C. Denny, Attorney General of the
              State, with Courtland C. Matson, Prosecuting Attorney, and Hon. Sol. Claypool and W.
              R. Harrison, all of whom claim to represent the State, appeared before the committee
              and advised the committee that it was unwise and unnecessary te recommend any
              legislation on the subject of their investigations. The committee therefore had no
              recommendations to make.The report was signed by Senators Brown, Dittemore, Sleeth,
              Gooding and Bird.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN moved the adoption of the report. He said a suit was pending in the Owen
              Circuit Court, commenced in the Putnam Circuit Court, for the forfeiture of the
              charter of this Company under the 23d, section. If the Legislature passes a resolution
              recognizing the existence of that corporation it will prove a complete stop to further
              proceedings in this suit. The attorneys for the State do not feel sure that they can
              collect this money under the twenty-third section but they do feel sure that they can
              mantain their action against the Company on other grounds so as to work the forfeiture
              of the charter. The committee think thnt it would be wise not to interfere with this
              pending litigation and jeopardize and hazard the collection of this money altogether
              under the twenty-third section.</p>
            <p>Mr. B. feared that precedent legislation was necessary before any liability is
              incurred on the part of this company to pay any money to the school fund. It will be
              remembered further, that a forfeiture of the charter does not necessarily obtain this
              money. Where a forfeiture is worked, a trustee or receiver is appointed to sell the
                <pb n="433" xml:id="VAA8558-14-433"/> property. He administers upon it something as
              a trustee on his trust. He takes the franchise and the property, and everything
              belonging to it, and makes settlement with the creditors of the corporation. So if
              this franchise is forfeited in this suit, before one dollar of money can be collected
              by the State for the school fund, they have got to go to some court and get that court
              to decide, unless they can make a compromise, that the construction of this charter
              claimed by those claiming to represent the State is the true construction. So it is
              thought by the lawyers claiming to represent the State that the Legislature had better
              not interfere. On the other hand, the corporation has been here by its attorneys and
              insisted that a resolution should be passed by the Legislature directing that a suit
              should be brought against them at once. They know that that will be a complete
              estoppel and bar to this suit in Owen county. The committee thought that it was the
              part of wisdom to allow the suit to take its natural course. There is full and ample
              remedy by reason of the existing law for the institution and prosecution of such a
              suit against the company. All there is involved now is this, that the Legislature make
              no decision on the merits of this controversy, but leave the case to be disposed of in
              the court where the suit is instituted. Another reason is that the Judge down there,
              in deciding a demurrer filed by the company to the complaint in the action, has
              construed this section twenty-eight in favor of the State, and it seems to me that we
              had better not legislate this case out of existence and pass it to another judge, who
              might possibly construe it the other way. The late Attorney General construed this
              section to mean this, that in the first place they had a right to charge just such
              rate of tolls as they pleased; next, they had the right, in the first place, to get
              back by dividends the full amount of the sum invested, and ten per cent. per annum
              thereon and that after they had done that the Legislature could then come in and
              assert its right to regulate their tolls, and if, in the regulating of the tolls the
              freights and tolls they received afforded an amount beyond fifteen per cent. upon the
              actual amount invested and the fund for contingencies, then and not till then could
              anything go to the school fund; and that seems to me to be the true construction of
              that section. But the learned Judge down here has construed it otherwise, and the
              committee think it is the part of wisdom now to leave that which properly belongs to
              the judiciary to the judiciary. The legislative department cannot forfeit a charter or
              collect a debt. It only affords the means by which the judiciary can cause these
              things to be done. The law is ample and the question is, shall we legislate this suit
              out of existence or leave it there to be adjudicated by the court?</p>
            <p>Mr. O'BRIEN said he understood that there was an information pending in the Owen
              Circuit Court against this company to forfeit its charter, and that that information
              contains an allegation of fraud on the part of the Company, but the committee express
              the opinion in their report that they have not been guilty of fraud.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. The committee say so far as any evidence presented to this committee is
              concerned.</p>
            <p>Mr. O'BRIEN. If the question is pending in that court, why make a legislative record
              on that point?</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. The committee was sent out to ascertain whether there was fraud or not. It
              has investigated that subject and finds none. But we have refused to put that question
              in the shape of a legislative expression upon that subject for the very reason that if
              we did it might prejudice the claims of the State.</p>
            <p>Mr. HARNEY said this was an old question. He had investigated the matter somewhat
              independently, and had come to a conclusion entirely in accordance with the report of
              the committee, but in some measure upon a different basis, looking at it not from a
              legal point of view, but merely from an equitable point of view. The act incorporating
              this Company was passed in 1847. It was the time when the State conferred special
              charters on all incorporated companies. On looking through the records of those times
              he found it was a very common occurrence for the State to reserve certain rights as
              immunities that would accrue to the State, as a consideration for the special powers
              and privileges granted to the companies. This company was chartered previously to
              1852, but the road was not completed, or at least had not begun to be remunerative
              until after the general act was passed allowing all corporations to come in under the
              general law. At that time all the special protection that the State had extended to
              this Company had ceased, at least they were no longer protected against competition.
              Section eighteen of its charter virtually implies that the State would protect it
              against competition. Under the act of 1852, no protection of that kind was passed, and
              now we have a road running parallel with this road. Finding that the State reserved
              these proceeds for the extraordinary protection afforded, and that the State
              afterwards, by general law, allowed all roads to come in under the same provisions the
              right in equity, to these proceeds would not exist, and he did not think because a
              road had been more prudently and economically managed it would be fare for the State
              to extort from it a portion of its earnings. If there28 <pb n="434"
                xml:id="VAA8558-14-434"/> is a legal liability in this Company, let the courts
              determine it.</p>
            <p>Mr. GOODING confessed that a short time ago he was in favor of a resolution directing
              the Attorney General, or the Superintendent of Public Instructions, to bring a direct
              suit for the purpose of testing in the courts this question that lawyers dispute about
              in the twenty-third section, and the further purpose of recovering any sum of money
              that might be due to the State, if the construction should be contrary to what the
              railroad says it is. But when the committee met the time before the last, the Attornoy
              General of the State, an officer whom they were bound to recognize, and the
              Prosecuting Attorney who had brought a suit in behalf of the State in the Putnam
              Circuit Court, and Judge Claypool and Mr. Harrison, all representing the interests of
              the State, came voluntarily before the committee and stated in most earnest and
              emphatic terms that they desire no action should be taken; that they had a case
              already pending for that express purpose, and that any action taken by us would tend
              to embarrass that case in court; and that they could recover to the State all that was
              due. For this reason the committee made no recommendation. On the other hand, a
              memorial, which was spread before the Senate here in behalf of the road requested that
              a suit should be brought. [See <hi rend="cc">BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS</hi>, Vol.
              XIII pages 201, 202 and 203.]</p>
            <p>If we were to recommend such action we would be recommending it against the advice
              and consent, and over the protest of men representing the State in cases now in the
              courts. The present Attorney General is of opinion that under the twenty-third section
              of the charter of this Railroad there is something due the State. The proper place to
              settle this question is the courts and not the Senate Chamber; and it is unwise to
              call upon this body, only part of which are lawyers to pass upon a legal question; and
              for these reasons the committee, against their own preconceived notions were induced
              not to recommend the commencement by the State of a suit. But suppose we had come in
              here, in compliance with the request contained in the memorial from the Railroad
              company, and over the protest and advice of the Attorney General and the prosecuting
              Attorneys, what light would it put us in before the country? Some gentlemen say we
              ought to take some affirmative action. What affimative action could we take? The
              committee has had some labor to perform, have spent some time at it, had some anxiety
              about it, and have arrived at the conclusion that the case being in court, we will not
              undertake to settle a legal question about which the best talent of the State differs.
              Suppose we were to undertake to settle the point made in that twenty-third section,
              how many members of the Senate are lawyers? We would be taking a great responsibility
              upon ourselves.</p>
            <p>Our government is organized upon the principle of three separate departments -
              executive, legislative and judicial. If there is any lack of legislative power let us
              supply it. If there is no law empowering an officer the State to bring such suits as
              are necessary, let us pass such a law, but Senators will find by reference to the
              power given the Superintendent of Public Instruction that no legislation is necessary.
              I desire to call the attention of lawyers in the Senate to section twenty-six of the
              Common School Law. It reads as follows: [Mr. G. read it.] Here is ample power given to
              bring all the suits necessary to recover money due the school fund. In view of the
              letter of the Attorney General which is made part of this report, your committee have
              seen proper to report back the facts to the Senate, and recommend that the facts be
              allowed to be litigated before the courts. Let us leave to the Judiciary the questions
              that properly belong to that branch of the Government.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. I do not desire to make an argument but a brief statement. It will be
              observed that my name does not appear as signed to that report. While I agreed fully
              with the Senator from Vanderburg (Mr. Gooding) as to the best policy to be pursued, I
              prepared a report, which I thought it was proper the committee should present, but for
              the reason stated such report has not been made. We were met by the Attorney General
              and requested not to recommend legislation on the subject - that is the reason.</p>
            <p>Mr. O'BRIEN was satisfied with all of the report except that part which exonerates
              the Company from fraud. While he thought probably no fraud had been committed, he did
              not believe it would be expedient to so declare by concurring in the report of the
              Committee. He said: In my opinion, when we concur in that report we put it upon the
              record as the opinion of the Senate that the officers of the Terre Haute Railroad
              Company have not been guilty of fraud. That being the case I want to leave that
              question also to be decided by the courts after investigation, after they have heard
              all the evidence - which this committee has not heard. Why gentlemen should come into
              this Senate and make a report exonerating a company from a charge made against it in
              the courts and leave other questions to be considered there, I cannot tell. I think
              this question might just as well be considered there as the other. I am inclined to
              think the committee are right in their opinion. As far as my information goes I am
              inclined to think the officers of this company have not <pb n="435"
                xml:id="VAA8558-14-435"/> been guilty of fraud; but if there is any necessity for
              leaving any portion of this question to the courts, that portion should go with it. I
              am not willing to vote for this report with that opinion in it.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN contended that this expression of the opinion of the Committee could not
              prejudice the case of the State, and that to strike it out would charge the Company
              inferentially with fraud, and he said that when a case is tried in the courts the
              questions of fact found upon the trial, are the only questions of fact that turn the
              verdict in the case, as far as the question of fact is concerned. And I go even
              farther and say that should both branches of the General Assembly concurrently
              investigate the naked question of fraud, and upon that investigation report no fraud,
              that that report would not be a bar to the trial of the case upon a question of fraud
              in any court in the State, but it would be a bar to a suit in which was involved the
              question of the franchises, because it would be a recognition on the part of the
              Legislature of the corporation, and that recognition of the corporation would be an
              estoppel to any previous inquiry with reference to the existence of the
              corporation.</p>
            <p>Mr. O'BRIEN. I would ask the Senator if, in his opinion, a concurrence by the Senate
              in the report of this Committee would be used against the State in any court ?</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. It is my opinion it would not. The investigation made here is certainly ex
              parte. And even if it would be introduced in evidence it could not control the case,
              because it is a finding of a case on facts presented to this body and this alone. And
              if this report should be introduced into evidence any way, the report would have to be
              accompanied with the evidence upon which it is founded. Here is what the report says:
              "The Committee further report that in the investigation they have made they find no
              evidence of corruption, concealment or fraud."</p>
            <p>Mr. GOODING. In another place it states distinctly that both sides claim the facts in
              the case have not been before the Committee.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE. The question is as to the effect of such action by the Senate.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. My judgment is that the State of Indiana is no party to this action down
              here.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE. The simple question is this: If the Legislature does not represent this
              fund - if the Legislature does not control this fund, what power is there to do so?
              That is the question.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. I answer that there can be no legislative expression, unless by concurrent
              action of both Houses, and in this case there is no proposition to concur. Here is a
              Committee charged with the duty of making an investigation, and upon it, here, as a
              question of fact, it has been unable to discover any fraud; and I say that all this
              talk about the Terre Haute Railroad Company bribing and buying members of the
              Legislature is the sheerest clap-trap and nonsense. I believe it simply to be an
              ill-founded charge, and in my place in the Senate, say that my opinion is adversely to
              such a charge; I don't believe gentlemen connected with that road have committed
              bribery and corruption. If gentlemen want to lay that charge to old Chauncey Rose,
              Dick Thompson, or, W. R. McKeen, I don't propose to.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. I would inquire if the rights of the State would be enlarged or
              diminished, whether fraud is found one way or the other?</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. Not in the least, because if the franchises of the road is stricken down
              on account of fraud by the managers that puts the road in the hands of a commissioner
              or receiver for sale, and he sells it, - for what, purpose? For the purpose of
              settling and adjusting with creditors and turning it over to the owners, but before
              the school fund gets one dollar they have got to show that they are entitled to it,
              and in my judgment they never have a claim until precedent legislation is enacted.
              That is my opinion.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. Other members of the Committee have a different opinion.</p>
            <p>Mr. O'BRIEN. I understand that there is a charge in that information that this
              Company enlarged their stock for the express purpose of preventing their dividends
              from being large enough to get into the school fund.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. The complaint expressly alleges bribery of members of the Legislature, and
              general fraud and dishonesty. These men did take their surplus earning and diverted
              them to the purchase of stock in other lines, which would have been dividends, and
              would have sooner paid back the sum invested. Whether they had the right to do that or
              not, depends upon the proper construction of this twenty-third section. If the true
              construction is that the school fund is not entitled to a share of the earnings until
              precedent legislation is had, of course they had the right to do it. They believe that
              construction is right, and supported by the Attorney General of the State, they acted
              upon that belief.</p>
            <p>Mr. O'BRIEN. Is not that part of the charge in the information, that they used their
              surplus earnings to enlarge their own stock?</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. Whether in the information or not, in so far as that act is concerned we
              have found no fraud, and in my judgment there is no fraud.</p>
            <p>Mr. O'BRIEN. Whv not transfer that to <pb n="436" xml:id="VAA8558-14-436"/> the court
              with the rest? I understand the duty of the Committee is to report the facts with the
              evidence, and not that they express an opinion upon a question of fact which is
              brought before a court. And at the same time the Committee don't pretend to have all
              the evidence.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. Then the opinion is worth nothing in the case. It is not a matter of
              public record recognized by any law of this State, as evidence in any court. As far as
              my personal opinion goes, I would be in favor of passing a resolution striking down
              that suit. In the first place, I do not believe the company is liable to the school
              fund; and in the next place, if liable it is solvent,and any judgment found against it
              can be made without striking down its franchises. But because the Attorney General and
              these men beseeched and implored that the case should be let alone, I gave up my
              opinion. The Terre Haute and Indianapolis road is the only railroad between the east
              and the Pacific coast that is a domestic road and owned by Indiana people. It is to
              the interest of foreign companies to break down its franchises and place it in the
              hands of the Pan Handle.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEEL. I think the report with a slight amendment should be concurred in, and for
              the purpose of testing the sense of the Senate I offer the following amendment to the
              report: Strike out that part of the report which declares that "in the investigations
              made the committee found no evidence of corruption, concealment or fraud." The action
              of this Committee should have no influence one way or the other, upon the trial of the
              present suit or suits that may be brought. I can not see the necessity of saying one
              thing or another. Why not leave it as the balance of the report leaves it - expressing
              no opinion one way or the other? The matter of fraud, is a matter I think will come up
              in the investigation of this case, or in suits that may hereafter be brought;
              therefore I can see no harm in striking out that part of the report. And I don't see
              why the Committee will not be exonerated as well by doing so as by allowing that part
              of the report to remain. I think it right to leave it to the Judiciary to find
              everything that is necessary to be found in the case. I think that would bring the
              whole Senate together. I think the main question presented to the Committee for
              investigation was to ascertain whether suit should be brought directly.</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH. An investigation has been had, and the report does not recommend any
              affirmative action. It is thought by some members that if the report is concurred in
              it may work a prejudice to the school interests; and if the report is laid upon the
              table the information will be as available as to concur in it. The case in the court
              may be disposed of during the present month and before the adjournment of this
              legislature; and it seems to me the best disposition of the report would be to lay it

            <p>Mr. DAGGY, in explanation of his vote, said: I will vote against laying the report on
              the table. The case may not be tried this term of the court; it may be postponed, and
              I think to lay the report upon the table we would be just as much in the dark as now.
              I vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. GOODING, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: I don't think
              to lay the report upon the table would be treating the Committee exactly right. If
              there is any part of the report wrong, let's expunge it, and not say that because we
              can not approve of one little particular therefore we will lay it upon the table. I do
              hope the Senate will not impliedly cast an impression abroad that they disapprove of
              the report of the Committee. I vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. GREGG, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: In casting my
              vote to lay the report on the table, I do not do it with any intention to reflect upon
              the Committee. If I understand it the adoption of this report would bind the hands of
              the General Assembly during this session, and for two years to come, from authorizing
              any direct suit to be brought to recover the money due the school fund, or to
              investigate the matter. I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: In making this
              motion and voting for it, I do not intend to cast any reflection upon the Committee. I
              vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. NEFF, when his name was called said in explanation of his vote: With the
              amendment offered by the Senator from Grant [Mr. Steele,] I would have no objection to
              the report; without that I would be in favor of laying it on the table, with a view of
              corrrecting the report. I vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. O'BRIEN, in explanation of hie vote when his name was called, said: I can't vote
              for this motion because I want <pb n="437" xml:id="VAA8558-14-437"/> this subject
              disposed of, I am inclined to think that perhaps the report of the Committee is right.
              They have investigated the subject, and the report meets my views with the exception
              of the particular in which we are proposing to amend it. With that amendment I want
              the report adopted. I vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. SMITH. I would like to enquire whether the Senator from Jackson, [Mr. Brown,] has
              accepted the amendment proposed by the Senator from Grant [Mr. Steele?]</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. Not yet.</p>
            <p>Mr. RHODES, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said : As the
              Proposition stands I shall vote "no." I understand there is a proposition to amend by
              striking out certain matter referred to in the report, and I am not in favor of laying
              the whole proposition on the table in that condition. I vole "no."</p>
            <p>The result of the vote was then announced as above recorded.</p>
            <p>So the Senate refused to lay the report on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN demanded the previous question on Mr. Steele's motion to strike out that
              part of the report expressing the opinion that there has been no fraud, etc. It is in
              these words:</p>
            <p>"And your committee further report that in the investigations made they find no
              evidence of corruption, concealment or fraud in the matter of said company's relations
              and obligations to the State."</p>
            <p>The Senate seconded the demand for the previous question, and under the operation
              thereof the motion to strike out was agreed to by yeas 24, nays 19 - [See page 133 of
              this book for the yeas and nays and explanations of the votes of several
              Senators.]</p>

            <p>The vote was then announced as above recorded.</p>

            <p>After the disposition of other business - see pages 133 and 134.</p>
            <p>About half-past three o'clock Mr. BROWN rose to a priviledged question. He said that
              at the adjournment an evening or two ago a motion to reconsider a certain vote and to
              lay that motion on the table was pending. He asked that that question be disposed
              of.</p>
            <p>(The motion was to reconsider the vote by which the Senate refused to concur in the
              House concurrent resolution indorsing the President's Indian policy, and to lay that
              motion on the table.)</p>
            <p>Mr. DITTEMORE, the author of the motion, sought to withdraw it, but Mr. Brown
              objected.</p>
            <p>Mr. FULLER made the point of order that the motion had not been stated by the chair
              before the adjournment, and therefore the motion expired with the adjournment. The
              chair stated that the journal showed that the question was stated by the chair.</p>
            <p>Various points of order and other stratagems known to parliamentary tactics came from
              the Democratic benches to prevent action on Mr. Brown's motion, but all in vain.</p>
            <p>The points of order were overruled, and finally Mr. Brown demanded the previous
              question, which was seconded - yeas 24, nays 20.The question then being on the motion
              to lay the motion to reconsider the vote on the table, it was rejected - yeas 20, nays
              24a strict party vote.</p>
            <p>The motion then recurred on the motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion was
              lost, which was carried.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN then moved the adoption of the resolution, and Mr. Dwiggins, demanded the

              <head rend="center">THE GRAVEL ROAD LAW.</head>
              <p>Mr. Miller's bill [S. 18,] to repeal the act authorizing the assessment of lands
                for plank, macadamized and gravel road purposes, and also the act authorizing the
                construction of plank, macadamizad and gravel roads, saving the rights already
                required, being read the third time - </p>
              <p>Mr. MILLER, said that was his bill and he hoped it would be voted down.</p>
              <p>Mr. GREGG said he hoped it would pass, for it was one of the most important upon
                which the Senate was called to act. The Senate has already indicated its feeling by
                its action in reference to assessments for the construction of ditches and railroads
                against the will of the people. It is correctly assumed that these corporations are
                always organized for selfish purposes, for the benefit of a few at the expense of
                the many.</p>
              <p>Mr. STEELE thought the law would work great injustice. In many cases roads have
                begun in good faith and completed for a distance of, say four or five miles. The
                effect of this law would be to enable those living along the line of the road to
                enjoy the improvement without paying a cent. In other cases it would stop work on
                roads which were greatly needed and desired by the people.</p>
              <p>Mr. GLESSNER made an earnest speech in favor of the preservation of the gravel road
                law.</p>
              <p>Mr. DITTEMORE demanded the previous question on the passage of the bill, and there
                being a second to the demand, under the operations thereof the bill was rejected by
                yeas 15, nays 25 - as follows:</p>

                lobbies with the representatives of these corporations. I vote "aye"</p>
              <p>Mr. HALL, when his name was called in explanation of his vote said: I wish the law
                repealed because it is productive of so much ill feelling. I vote "aye."</p>
              <p>Mr. HARNEY, in explanation of his vote when his name was called said : Mr, Glessner
                has given reasons why we should vote for this bill. It is very arbitrary and
                therefore I vote to repeal the law. I vote "aye,"</p>
              <p>Mr. NEFF, when his name was called in explanation of his vote, said : I would like
                to discuss the merits of this bill somewhat, but it has been a rule of this Senate
                that after certain members have discussed their side of the question fully they move
                the previous question and cut off the debate. I would prefer to say what I desired
                to before any one voted ; but now in explanation of my vote I simply desire to say
                that I vote in favor of the repeal of the law; first, because of its defectiveness.
                I would be in favor of wiping out the present law and then passing one not so
                defective. I do not favor its repeal because I am in favor of turnpikes, but there
                is another reason why I am in favor of a repeal of this law. I believe it is wrong
                to tax men against their will for the purpose of placing funds in the hands of any
                corporation. I was opposed to the Railroad tax law on the same principle. You take
                money out of the pockets of the citizen and place it in the hands of a corporation
                without giving him any value received for it. The same principle obtains in this
                turnpike tax law that does in the Railroad tax law, for this reason that it takes
                money unwillingly out of the pockets of the tax payer - the farmer, the mechanic and
                the laboring man and gives it into the hands of a private corporation. For that
                reason if for none other, I would be in favor of repealing that law. You might as
                well tax the people to support a particular church or school, for instance the Roman
                Catholic's, as they believe their mode of tuition best, might ask for a tax to
                support their kind of schools, and yet I apprehend the people of the State would
                rebel against it. So if you were to attempt to build up a Presbyterian or Methodist
                school I apprehended the balance of the people would rebel against that. For these
                reasons I favor the repeal of the law. I vote "aye."</p>
              <p>Mr. ORR, when his name was called said: I wish to explain my vote. I believe the
                law passed regarding turnpikes was wrong, and its operation upon the people of the
                State oppressive. I am well satisfied that in my neighborhood it has produced ill
                feeling, heavy litigation in the Courts and we have not succeeded in getting our
                roads built. Entertaining these views I think it is my duty to vote to repeal any
                law that has produced so much discontent in neighborhoods. It has been a great
                expense both in money and kind-feeling in our locality, and I therefore vote
                "aye."</p>
              <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: The
                present law has some provisions in it that ought to be repealed, but so long as <pb
                  n="439" xml:id="VAA8558-14-439"/> there is no better I cannot vote to repeal it. I
                vote "no."</p>
              <p>Mr. SMITH, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said: I agree with
                the Senator from Shelby, [Mr. Glessner,] that it would be ill advised to repeal the
                law, and therefore I vote "no."</p>
              <p>Mr. STEELE, when his name was called in explanation of his vote said : I am opposed
                to the repeal of of this law. Like the gentleman from Randolph, [Mr. Neff.] I am in
                favor of passing some law well guarded. But I am opposed to repealing the present
                law, and therefore vote "no."</p>
              <p>Mr. THOMPSON, in explanation of his vole when his name was called, said: If this
                law would take effect giving notice six months in the future, I think I could vote
                for it, but I am afraid it would do great damage to contracts already let.</p>
              <p>Mr. NEFF. It saves all.</p>
              <p>Mr. THOMPSON. From my stand point I believe I shall vote "no."</p>
              <p>Mr. WADGE, when his name was called said: I wish to state the reasons why I shall
                vote to repeal this law. I was, sent down by my constituents to repeal all laws
                which give to corporations the power of taxation without representation. For that
                reason, therefore, voting as I did for the repeal of the Kankakee Valley Draining
                Company I will also vote to repeal the gravel road law. I vote "aye."</p>
              <p>The vote was then announced as above recorded.</p>
              <p>So the bill was rejected. </p>

          <p> The SPEAKER announced the order, viz: The consideration of Mr. Mellett's bill [H. R.
            55] to amend the Common School law of March 6, 1865, and adding supplemental sections,
            as returned with the recommendation of the special committee thereon - the question
            being on the final reading in the House of Representatives.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRETT. This is another of the bills I that involve a considerable increase of
            taxation. Some of its provisions might be well enough, but one of the chief
            objectionable features is, that it creates the office of County Superintendent, which is
            to be a substitute for the office of County School Examiner. It also provides, I
            believe, for town Superintendents, if certain officials see fit to appoint them. Now the
            question is whether we ought to create this new office of County Superintendent? It is
            not sufficient to say that the office can be abolished, because we see but very few
            offices that are. Under this act the County Superintendent will manage to put in his
            time most of the year round. It is true there are restrictions which the County
            Commissioners may put upon these Superintendents; but the County Commissioners are
            generally good natured men and easily imposed upon. It would be a very easy matter for
            them to persnade the County Commissioners to authorize them to go round to the county
            offices and the justices' offices and see whether they may find anything belonging to
            the school fund. I am certainly in favor of getting all that belongs to the school fund,
            but I am not in favor of getting one dollar of it by expending five dollars. Gentlemen
            here around me are saying that every dollar obtained in this way would cost at least
            five.</p>
          <p>Another objection to the bill is, that it allows none to act as county Superintendent
            unless he has been a successful teacher. That certainly ought not to be an objection to
            a man so acting ; but I insist that successful teachers are not the only persons who are
            qualified to make good Superintendents. I have known some successful teachers who could
            not successfully manage a hundred dollars. Now, while I would give the preference to a
            teacher, I certainly would not exclude a man well qualified for the position of County
            Superintendent, because he might not have been a teacher. We have a man in our county
            for examiner who is a college graduate and well qualified - he could instruct almost any
            man in the county; - yet that man would be excluded under this act, for he has never
            been a teacher. [He proceeded to read an extract from a letter he received yesterday
            from a Mr. Donahue, of whom he spoke as one of the most intelligent men in the State.
            The extract referred to this proposition to create County Superintendents in place of
            County Examiners - one <pb n="441" xml:id="VAA8558-14-441"/> in each county - at high
            salaries, and alleged that if it be passed, it will entail a heavy burden upon the
            people ; and that the present system is satisfactory to the people where the writer
            resides ; and therefore (so the extract closes) why not let the present system remain so
            long as it costs comparatively nothing? - He also showed from the report of the Auditor
            of Marion County, the comparative nothingness of the cost of the school examinerin this
            county of a hundred thousand people, the cost of the examiner last year was three
            hundred and ninety-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.] He continued : The question is
            simply this: Whether we will take out of the pockets of the people two hundred thousand
            dollars a year, which it will take to pay these County Superintendents? - two thousand
            dollars to each of the counties. It will be much better, if it is desirable to do so, to
            increase the school tax directly, and have the examiners as they are.Have we any
            assurance, Mr. Speaker, that your County Superintendents will be better qualified than
            the Examiners are now? I hope gentlemen will consider this question properly ; and not
            as if they were voting for or against the common school system of the State. We all
            desire the success of the Common Schools: but, at the same time, it is our duty to see
            that no money is wasted even in that direction.</p>
          <p>Mr. HELLER. I was living in Pennsylvania when a law of this kind was adopted there; and
            I lived there many years afterward. Men were appointed superintendents there as this
            bill proposes, and their pay was nearly the same. And I do know that in two of the
            counties - the one in which I lived and the one adjoining it - that one-third of the
            schools were not visited on any occasion during the year. Now then, if they could avoid
            the law there and get their pay, the same class of men may avoid the law in this State.
            We shall not advance the interests of schools by such a class of officers. The expense
            will run up to hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
          <p>There is a special objection to the seventh section, which opens the books and accounts
            of the clerk of the Court, Auditor, Prosecuting Attorneys and Justices of the Peace and
            township or school trustees at all times to the inspection of the county Superintendent;
            and whenever he shall find that any of said officers have neglected or refused to
            collect, and pay over to the school fund fines, forfeitures, licenses or other claims
            due the school fund and revenues of the State or have misapplied the school funds or
            revenues in their possession, he shall be required to institute suit in the name of the
            State of Indiana for the recovery of the same.</p>
          <p>Now, sir, have the people of the State of Indiana become so corrupt that we must send
            spys and commission men to go through the books of the county officers and find oot
            whether there is anything wrong in their records ? Has it become a necessity that we
            should send men to spy out what is done in the county offices? I think we should look
            this question square in the face, not only as to the direct expense which this bill will
            involve, but as to the expense of the law as it now is. I insist that it will be a very
            easy matter for these Superintendents to bring in their accounts, each of them, that
            they have been employed three hundred days of the year. I have not heard a word from my
            constituents on this subject; but I speak from my personal knowledge of the workings of
            this law. I do not pretend to say that this bill will not do some good but the good will
            be overbalanced by the harm that will be done by it.</p>
          <p>Mr. REMSEY. In the vote on this bill a few days ago, we were agreed on two points, as
            to the Superintendents' offices furnished at the county seats; and, as to the high
            salaries These were modified. Now, I can't conceive how gentlemen can bring in an
            argument against the bill that it is wanting in economy, since we have agreed that the
            pay shall be but four dollars a day for the time actually employed. - Looking through
            the Report of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, we find that the school
            tax is seventy thousand dollars. This is a large sum; and the question is: Shall we
            husband these funds for the benefit of the children of the State? - The gentleman from
            Daviess [Mr. Brett] has urged one objection : That under this bill, these county
            superintendents will put in most all of their time. But, if their time can be put in
            profitably, is not that an argument in favor of the bill ? But really their time is
            limited to the number of schools in the county, with certain conditions. The gentleman
            contends also, that these superintendents will cost the State two hundred thousand
            dollars a year.</p>
          <p>Now we have ninety-two counties in the State; and ninety-two superintendents at four
            dollars a day for the time that each of them will be employed will not probably run up
            to as much as forty-five thousand dollars a year; and to-day it costs us about twenty
            thousand dollars a year under our present Examiner system, which has done us no good,
            from the fact that the county Commissioners are not generally posted in matters
            connected with the common schools. As to the opinion of Mr. Dnahue, that gentleman does
            not seem to know what we want. We want; we demand, that each of these superintendents
            shall visil all the schools in his I county at least once or twice in every year: and it
            shall be a good service and cheaply <pb n="442" xml:id="VAA8558-14-442"/> obtained in
            the long run, I do hope the bill will pass.</p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. GIFFORD, the House took a recess till two o'clock P. M.</p>

          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
            <p>The SPEAKER recurred again to the consideration of Mr. Mellett's bill [H.R. 55] for
              amendment of the Common School law of March 6th, 1865, and for supplemental sections,
              etc. - the question being on the third and last reading in the House of
              Representatives.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. I cannot see why we may not even save money by this bill. I am in favor
              of the change it proposes in our school law ; yet this placing it in the hands of the
              Township Trustees does not suit me as well as to have it in the hands of the County
              Commissioners. I think also that these teachers should pay a license for examinations,
              as it would help to pay a part of these expenses. I would have to them pay a fee of
              one dollar for their certificate for one year and fifty cents for six months. I am
              obliged to say, sir, that this bill does not come op to the idea I had of it awhile
              ago ; and I hardly know what to do about it. I believe that for the present, if it is
              not modified, it will be defeated and, I do not want to see it defeated.</p>
            <p>Mr. GIVAN. I admit of the difficulty of getting at a bill of the importance of the
              one now under consideration that will meet the views of all the members of the House.
              This bill has been before the General Assembly for some time. It was introduced and
              printed during the Special Session, and it has been several times specially considered
              during the present regular session. We have also considered it in Committee of the
              Whole House. It has been printed and laid on the table of each member, and the
              amendments which have heen applied to it might make it difficult at this time, to
              understand precisely the present provisions of it. And these modifications of it are
              of no small importance involving questions that necessarily claim the honest and
              careful consideration of each member. While we are, perhaps, all ready to admit that
              radical changes ought not always hastily to be made, yet we should all admit that
              changes are necessary sometimes - that they are made necessarily to suit the temper of
              the timesand that our system to-day should be in advance of what it was ten or fifteen
              years ago, and that we even might require a different system from that first adopted
              might not seem strange.</p>
            <p>One of the objects of our school system is that it shall be uniform throughout the
              State - that the State shall furnish the system and the money by which free schools
              shall be carried on - and that its benefits shall be extended to every child within
              the State, And in order to make the system efficient, it is necessary that the schools
              should be so regulated as to be conducive to the greatest good of the people.</p>
            <p>Since the adoption of our present system we have had the school officers known as
              county Examiners, whose duty has been to examine all applicants for authority to
              teach; and the duties of these officers have been increased from time to time until it
              seems to me that at the present time we have arrived at a period when we should make a
              more perfect and thorough organization of our schools. If this be so, then how are we
              to accomplish this reorganization? Are we to do it by leaving the system as it was
              fifteen years ago? Certainly not.</p>
            <p>As our schools are becoming more numerous, we see plainly the increasing necessity
              for a more perfect organization. I apprehend that there is not an incorporated city in
              the State but employs a City School Superintendent to superintend the schools of the
              city, and at from fifteen hundred to three thousand dollars a year. Yet gentlemen here
              complain because we propose that the school superintendent of the county shall have
              fifteen hundred dollars a year - complain that it is an enormous expense.</p>
            <p>A VOICE, Vincennes does not employ a superintendent.</p>
            <p>Mr. GIVAN. Vincennes, then, is behind the times. I will not admit that Vincennes has
              better schools than Lawrenceburg. I have great respect for the opinion and the
              judgment of the gentleman from Daviess [Mr. Brett,] yet he has objections to this bill
              - too, I believe. The first with reference to the expense; and the second that the
              bill compels the superintendent to be an experienced teacher. Now it seems to me that
              the gentleman's objections are not good - that they do not apply to a question of
              ordinary business management, we should look at this question as a man regards any
              business interest. And I submit that it would be just as reasonable to refuse a just
              remuneration to the supervisor of the roads as to a school superintendent. The first
              question is, do we require a County School Superintendent ? If we do, why then,
              certainly we must expert to pay him a reasonable compensation. I am not in favor of an
              extravagant compensation, nor am I in favor of paying a compensation not commensurate
              with his duties; but I am in favor of paying a reasonable compensation for what he is
              required to do under the law. Now what is that compensation? Simply four dollars a day
              - only one half what a member here receives. I submit to the gentleman from Daviess
              whether he would like to wade through the mud in his county for less than four dollars
              a day? It <pb n="443" xml:id="VAA8558-14-443"/>seems to me that the compensation is
              not too large.</p>
            <p>But the gentleman has another objection to the bill - that the superintendent shall
              examine the dockets of the Justices of the Peace and the Clerks' and Auditors' offices
              in order to see that the funds collected there to go into the common school fund shall
              be paid over and applied, and report to the State Superintendent what is done with
              this school fund. You find, sir, that in many of the wealthy counties they do not pay
              over a single dollar of these collections. There are many fines and forfeitures that
              are never paid over, and there is nobody to see that they are lawfully applied. In
              very many of the counties these officers have in their posession large amounts of
              money which the law says shall be applied to the common school? Perhaps the reference
              to the justice dockets is unnecessary because our justices in the country generally
              pay over promptly. But in many instances justices in the cities are not so prompt, and
              large amounts of money collected in the cities which the law says should be applied to
              the schools go into the pockets of the officers. It seems to me that the
              superintendent would be able in this way to bring into the school fund a larger amount
              of money than their annual compensation. With reference to the other provision to
              which the gentleman objected - that the superintendent shall be an experienced teacher
              - we certainly would desire to have the services of competent men.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRETT (interposing.) The gentleman in my county has never been a teacher, yet he
              is a good examiner.</p>
            <p>Mr. GIVAN The gentleman is mistaken. I am certainly informed that his county Examiner
              has taught school six months. But there may be exceptions to all general rules, and it
              is said that exceptions prove the value of the general rule. But it seems to me that
              this is a wise provision; at least it commends itself strongly to my judgment. It
              seems to me that no one can be better qualified for this position than the individual
              who has been a practiced, experienced, and acceptable teacher. If the gentleman were
              going to build, I think he would not employ an attorney for the purpose, but he would
              go to some individual experienced in building. So when we go for a superintendent, we
              go for one who is qualified for the position by experience. I submit then that this is
              a wise provision to compel these superintendents to be selected from the practical
              teachers of the county; and this provision will commend itself to the people.</p>
            <p>What has been the fact with reference to our County Examiners? It has too often been
              the case that individuals have been selected for this position without practical
              qualifications. Individuals having no experience as school masters have been appointed
              county examiners and consequently they have not commanded the respect which ought to
              be accorded to them by the teachers of the county. But still, as far as these
              objections are concerned, I have no doubt they have been raised here in all candor and
              honesty.</p>
            <p>But now, Mr. Speaker, with reference to the other features of this bill: (and there
              are other features in it which commend themselves to my judgment most heartily:) If
              there is any one thing in which the people of this State have been imposed upon more
              than in any other thing perhaps it is by those agents who have been traveling over the
              State to sell worthless school furniture and indifferent school books. Next to our
              insurance agents and patent right agents I know of no class which have inflicted upon
              us a greater wrong than that which has been imposing upon our people their worthless
              school books and furniture. The various means which they resort to in order to carry
              out their devices it would be long and useless to tell - for if thwarted in one
              respect they would not be avoided in another.</p>
            <p>And there is a provision in this bill which has been framed for the purpose of
              preventing this very thing. And by the operation of this provision (if this bill pass
              and I believe it will) there will be more money saved to the people of the State than
              the entire cost of these county superintendents. Where is there a township in the
              State that has not been imposed upon by some vendor of maps, school furniture, or
              school books which have been absolutely worthless? Now this bill provides that the
              school boards shall meet once a year upon a certain day and take this thing into
              consideration - so placing themselves as a barrier between these agents and the
              people. And the law provides that there shall not be a change of the school books
              oftener than once in three years. It seems to me that this is a provision demanded by
              the interests of the people.</p>
            <p>As to the other provisions of this bill it seems to me that they are well understood
              by the members here, and it can not be necessary for me to go into a discussion of
              every section. There may be in it some provisions that could be made better; yet
              taking the bill as a whole it seems to me that it can not fail to commend itself to
              the House.</p>
            <p>Mr. RENO. I believe our present school system is just as good a one as we can get. I
              am opposed to any system that will eat up the money of the people by official
              emoluments. The gentleman remarks upon the necessity of seeing what should be paid
              over to the school fund in the shape of fines, for- <pb n="444"
                xml:id="VAA8558-14-444"/> feitures, etc., but now we have officers whose duties are
              to look into the matter: and what assurance have we that the county superintendents
              will discharge their duties better than those officers? This system of collections, if
              we conduct it right, it is promised will be self-sustaining. But now I am informed
              that, in the State of Illinois, they have county superintendents and that the law is
              unpopular there - that they are greatly dissatisfied with it. Therefore I think we
              ought to go a little slow in this matter. The present school examiners I think are
              blamed where they ought not to be; and I think our county examiners know about as well
              the needs of their schools as any county superintendent could know. In my county we
              are so hard run to get competent teachers, that we have to petition the county
              examiner to give license in cases where he would withhold it: and hence he is
              sometimes blamed.</p>
            <p>Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. With reference to the objection of the gentlemau from Morgan and
              Johnson [Mr. Shirley,] to the clause requiring township trustees to elect the
              superintendent - surely the trustees are better distributed locally, and therefore
              better qualified to act in this matter than the county Commissioners ; and they are
              more directly interested in all the schools of the county. So I think this objection
              is not well taken.</p>
            <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH. If this measure will not bear discussion, it ought not to pass. If
              the friends of the bill can not defend it, it ought not to become a law. I have
              objected to the bill till it was amended - and we can not all agree precisely on any
              one thing. The amendment as to that feature of the bill which required the county
              Commissioners to provide an office for the superintendent - that has been stricken
              out, and that has been a principal objection to the bill. But gentlemen talk against
              creating a new office. Had this bill come into the House with a title like this : A
              bill to change and to prescribe the duties of school examiners, no man would have
              fretted himself at all about it, for you have in this bill precisely the same number
              of officers as you now have examiners, and almost the same office.</p>
            <p>As far as my county is concerned, the superintendent would discharge about the same
              duties as the examiner discharges now. In my opinion this bill ought to pass - and
              there are good reasons for it. Throughout the State our common school system is not
              working well: and I am in favor of the proposed change on this account. And I am in
              favor of it because gentlemen who have made teaching a specialty have recommended
              it.Our State Superintendent who stands as high as any man in his profession has
              recommended it; his predecessor recommended it, every teacher in the State with whom I
              am acquainted has recommended it, and the Superintendents of Public Instruction in
              other States has recommended it.</p>
            <p>Now how do we form our opinions upon questions that we have not examined? Why it has
              been a rule amonst us here to take advice; and, when a bill comes in proposing to
              amend the practice act, we inquire if it is recommended by the lawyers, and we take
              their advice and vote with them upon it. And when my friend from Daviess [Mr. Brett]
              comes in here and make a speech to tell us what he thinks about the duties of the
              State officers or of the county officers, I would regard what he says, because he has
              ably discharged the duties of these offices himself. Therefore, when that gentleman
              gives me instruction how I should vote on a fee and salary bill, I feel that I am
              voting right when I vote as he advises me. And when my friend from Elkhart [Mr.
              Thompson,] who is an experienced county Commissioner, advises me in regard to any
              legislation concerning county and township business, I am disposed to take it and vote
              as he does. And just so now, when all these professional educators come up here with
              concurrent and unanimous voice asking for this thing shall we not heed their advice
              ?</p>
            <p>The bill does not create new offices. It plants no new man in the court house; and it
              does not add to the public expense. We certainly have not much to boast of about our
              schools above those of other States around us. In the State of Michigan which is a
              good model they have these county superintendents?</p>
            <p>Mr. BRETT (interposing.) I have recently seen a petition in the State of Michigan
              asking for the abolition of this office.</p>
            <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH. That may be so; but we have here another neighboring State also with
              county superintendents; and we are told that this law meets the endorsement and
              approval of the people of the State of Illinois. This superintendent is to overlook
              others, having in charge the schools and the school funds, and all cases of
              incompetency and fraud must come to him for correction and remedy; and he is to be the
              medium of communication between the State Superintendent and all his subordinates. He
              is to give to the school system a unity of idea and a harmonious action, looking
              constantly to the interests of the common schools; and he will most certainly defeat
              the schemes that are palming their worthless school furniture and books upon the
              people. There is special complaint that we have too many book sellers coming around
              for our common schools. I would say, let us have one set of books and adhere to it at
              least four or five years.</p>
            <p>Now about the expense: I doubt very <pb n="445" xml:id="VAA8558-14-445"/> much if
              this bill will add a dollar more to the public expense. In fact I believe it will be
              diminished by it, if we count the proceeds of the additional security which it gives
              for the collections of fines and forfeitures, for there is scarcely a large county in
              the State where all these fines and forfeitures are all paid into the school fund. I
              have a list of the amounts paid in from this source by all the counties for the last
              ten years. There is the great county of Allen - she has paid in but five dollars. How
              many hundreds of dollars must there be in the county of Allen due and unpaid that
              belongs to the children of the State! In Bartholomew they have paid in two hundred and
              seventy-three dollars in that time; in Benton two hundred and seventy dollars; in
              Dearborn eight hundred and eight dollars; in my own county they have paid in about two
              hundred dollars; in Vigo nothing; in Wabash nothing; in Warren nothing; and so on down
              the list of counties. My opinion is that if these claims of the school are faithfully
              paid in - and I think they might be under this bill - that the amounts gathered by the
              several superintendents would more than pay them. I think sir, that there is a good
              deal in this argument; for if Dearborn county has paid eight hundred and eight dollars
              in ten years, what should be reasonably due from the counties of Allen, and Marion,
              and Vigo, and from my own county, which have paid in little or nothing! It seems to me
              that something should be done in this matter. I am told that it is the duty of the
              Prosecuting Attorney to attend to this matter, but the Prosecuting Attorney does not
              do it. Make it the duty then of somebody to do it, and I believe we will have done
              something for the good of the common schools. The idea of a fee for a license to teach
              - I think that is contrary to public policy. The Examiner gets a fee if he gives a
              license, and nothing if he gives not the license. So many a worthless man has got the
              license because he paid the dollar. It is a bribe to the examiner. I see nothing wrong
              in this bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. LENFESTY. Having been one of the committee appointed by the Chair to examine the
              bill and amend it, I desire to be heard for a few moments. I am at a loss to
              understand why we are so slow to act in the interest of common schools. There have
              been hundreds of speeches here prefaced by the remark, that the speaker would go as
              far for the support of common schools as any other member on this floor; and here we
              have a bill the sum of the labors of the entire Session in this matter, and I think
              now is the time that we should take advantage of the amendments of the school law
              which it proposes, as it is probably the last measure for the improvement of the
              schools that will come before us during the Session. We as a people of Grant county
              made the improvement of the common schools an issue in the last canvass. It was
              discussed on the stump, and it became evident that the people desired that something
              should be done.</p>
            <p>The fact is, Mr. Speaker, the school system is defective; and hence the labors of the
              Committee on Education and of gentlemen here proposing many changes. And gentlemen, in
              their opposition to the bill here, have not attacked the change of the system
              particularly. They have said that the County Superintendent would not work well; but
              their amendments have been for the purpose of killing the bill, because the County
              Superintendents may be, perhaps, a little more expensive than the system which employs
              the county Examiners - because we increase the pay one dollar per day, they will stand
              against the bill. I can hardly believe that this opposition is because gentlemen are
              not willing to meet any proposition for the improvement of the common school system.
              It has been objected that we are creating a new office; but, if this is true, then I
              do not understand the bill - we simply change the name of the officer - and I am
              obliged to say to the House that the compensation which gentlemen would propose is a
              niggardly compensation - to take a man's services for less than four dollars a
              day.</p>
            <p>In order that the bill might meet the narrow views of gentlemen, the proposition for
              furnishing the office of the Superintendent has been cut off entirely; and the School
              Commissioners will be compelled to go around and hunt up the officer, because
              gentlemen rise up here and say we are paying too much. As far as this superintendency
              is concerned, one gentleman speaks of its operation in the State of Pennsylvania, and
              another gentleman speaks of its operation in the State of Michigan, but I have had on
              my table for several days a communication from the State Superinterdant informing us
              that the system of County Superintendency works well - that it is a step in
              advance.</p>
            <p>The Examiner is paid three dollars a day now; and I say pay the superintendent four
              dollars a day, and let the teachers pay him what is right for their license. We can't
              pay the teachers yet a compensation sufficient to secure good talent. The question of
              expense then can not be urged as a good objection to this bill, and I believe it ought
              to pass. But I believe also that it does not go far enough. I believe that these
              superintendents are restricted too much. I believe that they should devote their
              entire time during the entire school term. Still we must do what we are able to for
              the passage of this bill.</p>
            <p>It is claimed that this bill is in the inter- <pb n="446" xml:id="VAA8558-14-446"/>
              est of the school furniture or school book men, but I would ask gentlemen if there
              could be a system devised more favorable for these furniture and school book men than
              that we have now? Their agents come in at discretion, representing concerns who know
              very little about the schools; and the consequence is that there is no county in the
              State that has entire uniformity in their school books. There should be a uniformity,
              and I say that this bill, being gotten up by the proper hand, and carefully drawn in
              the interest of the common schools, it should be favorably considered by the House;
              and I hope no further amendment will be offered for the sake of defeating it. I am
              afraid that this is the secret of the opposition to the bill; that gentlemen regard
              this county superintendent as one who will be too efficious about the matter of
              collecting the fines and forfeitures of the school fund. But we need just such a man
              in every county to attend to this very thing, for which we have no special officer;
              and the reason this matter is neglected is because, what is everybody's is nobody's
              business. I am sure that these superintendents will secure to the school fund from
              this source in every county more than five times what their compensation will amount
              to. I am informed by a gentleman of this city, that there are not only hundreds of
              dollars belonging to the school fund and: presumptously withheld in the hands of
              public officers, but there are thousands more resting in the hands of officers and
              ex-officers, simply because there is no officer whose special duty it is to look after
              this interest. There can be no possible harm in examining these dockets and books; and
              there is a reason for it in the real and numerously alleged official delinquencies in
              this matter.</p>
            <p>Mr. HELLER. Does this bill abolish the office of county Examiner ?</p>
            <p>Mr. LENFESTY (in his seat.) Yes sir.</p>
            <p>Mr. HELLER. Well, a good many think differently. The next question is this: Will the
              good growing out of these superintendents be sufficient to reimburse the money they
              will cost ? Have you ever tried them, sir ? Do you know the expense they will make ?
              This bill will place these superintendents in a position where they will form rings,
              so that they may all be charged with the same elective fluid - all share in the
              plunder.</p>
            <p>Mr. KIMBALL in his seat. Did you ever have the rheumatism and use electricity as a
              remedy ? What do you know about electricity?</p>
            <p>Mr. HELLER. I do not know anything about it - only that it gives one curious feelings
              [Laughter.] - The gentleman from Grant [Mr.Lenfesty,] says he has strong evidence that
              the people of Pennsylvania, do notwant to adolish their offices of County
              Superintendent. The reason and the foundation of this is in the fact, that the
              Superintendents have formed such strong rings that the Legislature dare not interfere
              with them. I do know that this Superintendent business would have been abolished by
              the people of Pennsylvania in less than ten years, if they could have done it. I know
              whereof I speak: and I know that their superintendents license school teachers that
              can't spell the commonest words.</p>
            <p>Mr. LENFETY in his seat. I under-astnd that the gentleman from Allen graduated at
              Stordsburg, Pennsylvania(having ref-ence to a phamphlet of biogriphical notes of a few
              members of the Legislature, by , - who was subsequently excluded from the hall as a
              black-mailer.)</p>
            <p>Mr. HELLER. No sir, since you have misapprehended that thing as well as myself, I
              well tell you what it says: "He (Heller) attended school in Stordsburg about six
              months." Nothing said about graduating there. Its best always to tell the truth
              exactly. [Laughter.] But now, as I said this morning, you are placing a guard over
              your County officers, who is to go like a sneak-thief into those offices and poke his
              long nose and bony fingers into what is lawfully other peoples business. And if he
              should be a bad man, those officers who may be corrupt, knowing their man, might get
              round him, and the wrong would be made worse, and if he should not happen to be a bad
              man, in all such cases he would get up cases of litigation. I tell you, sir, this is a
              desperatly bad bill, and the people will find it out when it is too late : For you
              can't get a Legislature that will vote down such a law, for the simple fact that the
              cry will be raised, that all opposition to it comes of opposition to common schools.
              As I said before, when this thing gets to be four or five years old, and when all
              those school shysters and hangers-on get fastened in their places, you can't wipe it
              out; and the sooner you put your foot on it the better. I know these Superintendents
              in Pennsylvania, they would not visit half the schools in the county, and the people
              were powerless; they could not remedy it; and the same thing that stared them in the
              face will stare you in the face. If you put them offices into the hands of bad men
              they will use them for their selfish ends. I never will vote for a bill that strikes
              at the liberties of the people by enacting injustice, as this thing does. The salary
              has nothing to do with this objection. If a man does work he ought to be paid for it.
              But this bill allows the Superintendent to use up the whole year, and charge for
              services he has not rendered.I do not concieve that the bill is right, and I shall <pb
                n="447" xml:id="VAA8558-14-447"/> vote against it; and I stand upon this without any
              instructions from my constituents as to the matter.</p>
            <p>Mr. WILLARD demanded the previous questiou ; but withdrew it immediately for</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. Before the vote is taken I desire to ask the unanimous consent of the
              house to amend the bill so as to suit the mind of the gentleman from Ripley.</p>
            <p>The SPEAKER. The Chair hears an objection.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. I have regretted Mr. Speaker that whenever this amendment has been
              before the House there has been a quiet attempt to talk it down - to cast a gleam of
              ridicule over it, and sink the members down into indifference to the whole subject;
              and I think gentlemen need to be reminded that we were sent here to protect the common
              school interests by a revision of the school law - This was made a prominent thing in
              the canvas : and if this really proposes an improvement in the School law or in our
              common School System we ought to consider it as becomes legislators accountable to
              their people I do not know so well whether this is an improvement or not. But as the
              gentleman from St. Joseph [Mr. Butterworth] has well said this bill is the result of
              the labors of the man who is at the head of the common schools of the State: and if
              such a man comes in here, with an expression of his views on this subject and asks of
              us this bill for the purpose of enabling him to carry out the School System which we
              have placed in his hand, shall we not grant it? Why should we not grant him this if it
              be reasonable and right ? Is it expensive, as gentlemen say? I say sir, there is no
              economy in keeping up a system which is weighing down the Schools; and if it requires
              hundreds of thousand more to make our system more effective, we should at once go for
              it. But this is only to change the County Examiner for the County Superintendent. It
              is very little if any additional expense: and should we not yield our prejudices and
              our cruel notions to the larger experience and maturer judgement of the superintendent
              of Public Instructions? Should we go contrary to the well being of our own children
              and say we will put our experience against the experience of the State Superintendent
              ? We have already done all that this bill proposes for the cities and towns. I speak
              of this one principle, that is the principle of County Superintendency. This is the
              main feature of this bill, and I shall vote for it if you strike out every other
              principle in it. It has been adopted in almost every city and town in the State, and
              every teacher of experience tells us that the County Superintendency is absolutely
              necessary for their success of the schools : and it is certainly right that we should
              grant to this department of the government that which experience tells us they should
              have, The constitution has wisely provided that our system shall be uniform: and, I
              will ask again why is it when this honorable and fair and open-handed movement is thus
              considerately thrown into our legislation that we should desire to cut it down with
              considerations of economy. I insist that we should grant it when experienced men have
              said it is necessary. Where do we go to find our model schools. Do we go into the
              country ? No sir: the people of my county come up to the county seat, to see our
              schools and school buildings; and they see and admire and imitate them : and I believe
              that the people of the entire State are now here by their representitives, demanding
              this imitation of the city schools, and it is also because the experience of the city
              schools has inaugerated the demand for this relief in our system that I demand it as a
              representative of the people in this House : and I believe the House will accord it
              and give to the common schools the Superintendency which the times demand.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. I had not intended to say a word on this subject; but I wish to say now
              that if this matter was canvassed before the people I have not heard of it. If it was
              demanded by the people of the State I have not heard of it till now. If there are
              petitions for it I have not seen them. I feel that the opposition of members to this
              bill is misconstrued. There seems to be a disposition to heap upon this opposition the
              odium of opposition to the common schools. But be this as it may I propose to vote as
              my people want me to vote; and if that is to be construed into opposition to the
              common schools, let it be so. If there is any gentleman who has not heard it charged
              here that this bill is in the interest of rings and cliques he has not very good
              hearing. I do not myself say it is so, but I do say this, that the manner in which the
              friends of the bill have conducted this discussion should make a thinking man doubt
              its propriety. When you clothe these Superintendents with authority to go all over
              their counties and examine every book in them to hunt up those fines and forfeitures
              it puts an entirely different construction upon the thing. The reason why Dearborn
              County paid that eight hundred dollars forfeitures into the fund was simply because
              her people violated the laws more than others. But it is the duty of the County
              Commisioners to take care of this fund; and is also made the duty and business of the
              prosecutors. Do you suppose that by putting the title of County Superintendent upon
              any man that it will make him any bet- <pb n="448" xml:id="VAA8558-14-448"/> ter? I
              want the friends of this bill to look upon it in the light of the experience of the
              past. I tell gentlemen that the obvious result of this measure will be to tax upon the
              common school fund for every Superintendent four dollars a day for every day in the
              year. It will be like the Missionary contributions to the heathen - giving ten cents
              to the heathen and ninety cents to get the missionary to him. I confess to you, sir,
              that I have not brains enough to comprehend this system; and if I had I should not
              want to use them in this way. One gentleman desires this amendment of the present law
              so as to secure uniformity in the school books; but does he not know that when you
              strike down competition in the manufacture of school books you necessarily raise the
              price. I would respectfully ask the House to pause before enacting such a provision -
              to say that your child, or your people shall be furnished with such books only, as are
              prescribed by law! You might as well say that we shall all wear the same cut of
              clothes.</p>
            <p>A VOICE. That would be all well euough if the State would provide them.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. Just so; and then the bill goes on to provide that all the furniture in
              all the schools of the State shall be provided by one man. Of all the objections to
              the bill these certainly ought to be striken out; but I cannot think that in its
              present shape it ought to pass.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY desired unanimous consent to amend the bill by striking out the emergency
              clause; but there being an objection, he desired to indulge in a few words in answer
              to the gentleman from Jefferson [Mr. Branham.] He said: As to the gentleman's
              objection to changing the school books, my experience is that the teachers generally
              want to change them every term : and my sentiment is that we need a statute to
              prescribe at least what shall be the text books - that the changes should not be too
              frequent.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. The objection I made was that the bill prescribes that the books shall
              be of a particular character or kind. I object to all snch proscriptions because they
              will give jobs to particular houses.</p>
            <p>Mr. LENFESTY. I do not wish to be misconstrued as to what I intended to say. What I
              intended to say was this: that under the present system we are frequently required to
              change our school books every school term; and under the present bill the educational
              men of the State will perhaps be required to get books, that may be continued for
              several years.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. If I thought there was any job to come out of this bill I would
              certainly refrain from voting for it: but I believe the bill has merits - that the
              committee on education have exercised sound judgment - have acted singly for the great
              school interest. As to the objection against allowing the books to be prescribed, I
              think that the system should be controlled throughout by statute, that there should be
              uniformity about it; and we all know that these changes induce an enormous expense;
              and that uniformity in the text books will be economy. Of course we shall expect of
              these book men that they will not charge an exorbitant price. And then it is a matter
              of policy to have this uniformity - the school system is a State institution, and the
              Constitution requires uniformity. If I am in error as to my vote, the responsibility
              is with the <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName>. I confess that I do not know
              myself what is the best system, and I am obliged to leave this responsibility in the
              hands of the State Superintendent and the Committee on Education. I cast my vote
              freely upon their advice, and hope that good may result.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRETT. In the few remarks that I submitted this morning I made no reference to
              the matter of uniformity, nor as to the character of the books. And now I wish to say
              another word: upon all these school books there are copy rights and the owner of the
              copy right of the books which are adopted, of course can charge as high as he pleases,
              or as high as he can induce the school officers to allow him to go. And I am not
              willing to turn over to him my interest and my children's interest, and give him
              absolute control of my purse, and this power of dictation to the State Board of
              Education. I am unwilling to give this control to the copy right man, or any number of
              men like him. In regard to the school furniture, there is the same danger in giving
              this discretion to the State Board; for these furniture men also have their patent
              rights upon all their improvements; and it can not but result in giving jobs to
              favorite men. I have known good scholars to come out of schools with indifferent
              furniture. I do not think we should make laws to enrich either the school furniture or
              the school book men.</p>
            <p>Mr. KIMBALL. This uniformity in school furniture and school books is a question which
              the bill refers to the counties. One class of books may be uniform in one county and
              another in another county.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. Is that a provision of the bill, and an argument for it by the framer of
              the bill ?</p>
            <p>Mr. KIMBALL. It is. And then it seems to me that we should adopt the clause to which
              gentlemen object, because they say it is an attempt to throw our school interest into
              the hands of patent right men. The bill provides that the County Superintendent shall
              sit with the school board and trustees, and shall be allowed to vote with them on all
              questions as one of themselves on all <pb n="449" xml:id="VAA8558-14-449"/>matters
              relating to school furniture, school tooks maps charts and the town library, and the
              township's and districts shall conform to their action; but these shall be changed but
              once in three years. These county boards have supreme control of this matter : and if
              any direction as to books or furniture should not happen to suit Daviess County or
              Jefferson County, - there is no compulsion that any county shall adopt any special
              fashion of books or furniture. It seem to me impossible that under this bill any
              considerable ring can control this matter, because it is in the hands of the township
              trustees. Now it seems to me, Mr. Speaker, that it is good management that brings
              prosperity. The people are taxed for the purpose of raising the school fund to educate
              the children of the common-wealth : and the people themselves, en masse, cannot attend
              to this matter. Hence we have the representative forms. Here is an immense sum of
              money collected every year and thrown into the treasuries of the counties and
              townships for the purpose of education, and in their hands it requires care and good
              management. If my friend from Jefferson [Mr. Branham,] were in charge of a railroad,
              having in his hands millions of dollars for the construction of the road, he certainly
              would appoint competent and well qualified Superintendents, in all the branches of his
              business. He could not attend to all the business himself. He would look around for
              assistance, and when he found a competent man he would be willing to give him a good
              price. The gentleman from Jefferson [Mr. Branham,] has said, that we should be
              governed by the experience of the past. Well if we look back twenty-five years or even
              fifteen years we find that the common school system of Indiana has not amounted to
              much. But you say that the legislatures have directed the system: when the last
              constitutional convention was called, it was deemed proper and wise by that body to
              provide for a State Superintendent of Public Instructions : and I can say with
              pleasure that that provision of the constitution has brought great good to the State.
              But the State Superintendent cannot look after every interest of the Schools: like the
              man who builds a Railroad or who manages the affairs of a bank, he must have
              assistants to enable him to see that the money of the people is not wasted, We ought
              to look at ever question in a practical light: for, when I part with capital, I want
              it to be productive. So the people having capital in the schools they want it properly
              taken care of and wisely directed so as to produce the desired result. Hence it does
              seem to me that there is a lack of this just precaution when gentlemen determine that
              they will not have these County Superintendents. Then as to the objection to four
              dollars a day for the Superintendents in the ninety two counties of the State. If the
              superintendent is employed for three hundred days of the year it will cost one hundred
              and ten thousand four hundred dollars: if he is employed one hundred days of the year
              the cost will be twenty-six thousand eight hundred dollars. Now sir, what is this four
              dollars a day for the proper application of the school fund of the people?</p>
            <p>These Superintendents we should remember must be competent men - we should remember
              that they must see that all the teachers do their duty, and that they are well
              qualified; and that the school money is all faithfully applied under the law. And we
              should remember that the Superintendent is to have nothing whatever to do with the
              school furniture nor with the books. Now, sir, where is that dangerous power entrusted
              to his hands ? Where that great injury that might result to the people ? I say to
              gentlemen that we take the responsibility of this bill. I care not what portion of my
              constituents may petition me to vote for a wrong measure - I would die before I would
              support a pernicious measure. This has been my rule here. I ask myself in the
              meditations of my own heart, is this thing right ? and when my judgment says it is
              right, the measure has my vote. And my judgment, and my sentiment is to give this
              great work into the charge of men that are competent. There are men here who can
              remember all the past history of our common schools, and I might ask them for the
              result of their meditations upon it. The pride of our system has been in our city
              schools. In all these we employ a city superintendent; and the price that we pay him
              is repaid to us four fold in the resulting benefits. Now why is it that the gentleman
              from Davies is in favor of retaining the examiners in preference to the
              superintendents ?</p>
            <p>Mr. BRETT. Just, simply, because the examiners cost little or nothing, and because
              the superintendents will cost two thousand dollars a year to each county.</p>
            <p>Mr. KIMBALL. Well, then as to the value received, how much of real value,
              educationally, do you get from the services of your county examiner for this little or
              nothing ? It sounds like the conclusions which I sometimes hear on the temperance
              question - the values are balanced evenly. But on the contrary I find millions of good
              from the superintendency. And while I could find no good to come from the liquor sales
              I was unable to vote for the bill that would encourage them. The gentleman has not
              pointed out the value received from his county examiner.</p>
            <p>Now, gentlemen, I ask you to do your29 <pb n="450" xml:id="VAA8558-14-450"/> duty in
              spite of all that may be said. You are preparing the way to educate all the people;
              you are building a superstructure the foundation of which was laid in the sacrifices
              of the founders of our government; and let us proceed upon the principle that all good
              government is founded upon the intelligence of the people.</p>
            <p>Mr. THOMPSON of Elkhart. The sixth section prescribes the duties of these
              superintendents. It is this</p>
            <p rend="blockquote">SEC. 6. The County Superintendent shall carefully examine the
              dockets, records, and accounts of Justice of the Peace, Clerk of Court, county
              Auditor, Commissioners and Prosecuting Attorney, and see that all fines, forfeitures,
              unclaimed fees, liquor licenses and surplus dog tax, etc., are promptly collected,
              reported and paid over to the proper fund or revenue. He shall see that the full
              amount of interest on school funds is paid and apportioned, and when there is a
              deficit of interest on the school fund, or a loss of any school fund, or revenue by
              the county, that proper warrants are issued for the reimbursement of the same.</p>
            <p>Now, there are duties enough to employ the time of the Superintendent one full year;
              examine the Auditor's books, the books of the county Commissioners, and the
              Prosecuting Attorneys, Clerks, Sheriffs, and Collectors, and the dockets of the
              Justices of the Peace. I tell you, sir, there is more service to be performed by him
              than can be done inside of any one year, and further; if I were a county officer, or
              any other of these officers, on my honor as a man, I would not ask any man to overlook
              my work ; your man might be hooted out of the office.</p>
            <p>This bill, it seems to me is gotter up more than any thing else for the purpose of
              creating another office; and it will involve an expense which the people will not
              bear. So far as this matter has been managed in my county they have no cause to
              complain there. My people are not in favor of this bill. I might go on and point out
              other defects of the bill but the time of this discussion is exhausted; and I only
              wish to enter my protest against, its passage.</p>
            <p>Mr. MELLETT. I do not wish to add any reasoning for the passage of the bill, but
              simply, if it is possible for me to do so, to give the House a clear understanding of
              what the bill is, and what are its purposes. The bill before the House is to provide
              for the amendment of certain sections of the present school law. It might be well for
              us to know what the present school law is; in the first place, in order to see what it
              needs and whether the proposed amendments are proper and prudent.</p>
            <p>The first section to the thirty-third section of the common school law provides, that
              the county Commissioners shall elect a person called the county Examiner, requiring
              him to take an oath of office etc,, etc. This isproposed to be modified by changing
              the name of the officer to that of county Superintendent instead of county Examiner.
              In other respects the requirements of the Superintendent are identical with those of
              the county Examiner, excepting as the bill now is, that the Superintendent shall be
              elected by the township trustees. This is one radical change of the bill and I am
              willing to accept it as a more prudent and practical arrangement. The township
              trustees have charge of the common schools of the county and I should think would know
              more about the schools because the schools are under their charge. There is one thing
              yielded to the school government of the cities which are made elective. These are the
              only changes in the first sections of the law - changes in the name and in the mode of
              the election of the superintendent.</p>
            <p>The next amendment is in section thirty-nine of the school law - in the second
              clause; they shall visit the schools of their respective counties as often as they
              shall deem it necessary. We come in here with an amendment and say that it is
              necessary for the Superintendents to visit every school in their respective counties
              at least once in every year. We restrict the Superintendents thus because the county
              Examiners have abused the law in this respect. Is once a year too often? surely no
              gentlemen can object to that; but my friend on the right, [Mr. Thompson of Elkhart,]
              has read the sixth section, and excepts to the creation of a new office - the office
              of county Superintendent. I would like to read that section again sir, and ask you
              whether there is anything in it on account of which your constituents will condemn you
              for voting for it. There is not a county in the State but has a large sum belonging to
              the school fund in the hands of its officers, collectors and justices, to be accounted
              for by somebody - large sums of money to be found in every county that has never been
              turned over to the common school fund. It is a notorious fact that the amounts
              forfeited in bonds by the non-appearance of criminals forms a long list of
              indebtedness to the school fund standing against every county in the State. The
              Prosecutor generally gets his bill, and nobody looks after the remainder. In my own
              county the remainder is five thousand dollars, which would be sufficient for the
              support of the office of county superintendent for several years. What is everybody's
              business is nobody's; and so this interest remains uncared for. But neither you nor I,
              nor any decent man is going into these offices without authority of law; for if he go
              without specific authority, he will be counted an intruder. But, make it his duty, as
              proposed in this bill, and he goes there as any other officer of the law.</p>
            <pb n="451" xml:id="VAA8558-14-451"/>
            <p>My friend on my right said he would hoot the intruder out of his office: - I know he
              gpeaks from good motives. But then any man that has a hundred thousand dollars
              dishonestly retained in his hands would tell you the same thing - would be as
              indignant as the gentleman from Elkhart.</p>
            <p>Of course such a provision as this would not be necessary in the case of any private
              fund, because the party interested would look after it himself. But here in the matter
              of this public common school fund, you must employ somebody to look after it. And that
              very allegation of the gentleman from Elkhart was an argument in favor of the bill
              when he said, it would employ a man every day in the year to examine into these
              offices. So much for section six. It has been well said, that this superintendency
              will ten fold repay all the cost of it to the counties.</p>
            <p>There is another thing -that in regard to the per diem. Gentlemen seem to think that
              the present county Examiners get nothing. The present school law provides for them
              three dollars per day for every day employed. The difference we make in this is four
              dollars per day instead of three; and we secure it so that the superintendent can't
              put his own construction upon his own services. Now, here is the provision according
              to which the Examiner is limited under the present law: " Provided said Board of
              Commissioners may determine the number of days he shall visit the schools." The
              Commissioners may cut his per diem down to nothing at all. But I have never heard of
              this cutting down by the Commissioners; on the other hand, the difficulty is well
              known to be this: that the Examiners refuse to visit the schools.</p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, the great fight over this bill is about the name of an office. We
              propose to substitute Superintendent for Examiner. Otherwise the language of our bill
              is almost identical with that of the present law - .There is great power in a name,
              sir. "Examiner:" does it not sound to you like a spy looking after defaults? But
              "Superintendent" is one looking over matters in general. The bill places the schools
              under the control of the Superintendent and makes him responsible for them. How is it
              now? We are outraged by placing incompetent teachers in the schools. And when there is
              complaint about the teacher, the examiner will tell you that he examined him, and that
              he found a creditable examination. The fact is, examinations make up all the business
              these examiners have in the schools. On the other hand, by the very name
              Superintendent, we show that it is his duty, whenever complaint is made, to go round
              and see if it is well founded, and to apply the needful corrections. The whole
              question then is about this: whether this County officer can better serve the schools
              by his examinations of the teachers, or by visiting the schools.I would like to put
              this one question to the gentleman from Jefferson [Mr. Branham.] I would like to ask
              him if he were employing a man to work in the building of a railroad, whether he would
              have him come into his office and examine him, and feel of his muscle ? No sir, he
              would not do that: but he would happen along some day as his man might be digging upon
              the embankment where the sun was burning down upon him, and see how he took hold of
              the thing: for he might find the most promising in appearance to be the most useless
              man in the lot.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. In the first place, I would have the man come to the office, and I would
              examine him ; then I would send him out with the squad to work, and let him try his
              hand. But I would never dream of sending a man there one day in the year to see how he
              got along. [Laughter.]</p>
            <p>Mr. MELLETT. He claims then, that the Superintendent of his men is as the
              Superintendent of the schools: and that is just the case. The workmen are the teachers
              : they are the workingmen of the land, educationally speaking: and the Superintendent
              does not have to sit there all day or an hour every day: but a single hour of
              visitation would do more good than all the examinations in the State. This giving a
              license is not according to the way in which we do business for ourselves. The friends
              of this bill would be glad to have a Superintendent for every township, and pay him
              well for it, as they do in the State of Connecticut. But it seems that we are to be
              satisfied with but one for each county.I believe I have referred to all the changes of
              the law proposed in this bill except one: that is the one in regard to the school
              books and furniture. - As the law is now, book agents or the school furniture agents
              can start out for Indianapolis and go into every county: and whenever he can find a
              Trustee that can be bought or persuaded, he can make a contract with him for his books
              or his furniture: and there is no power that can say to him nay. It is all between the
              two men. Does that give to your book agents or your furniture agents any room to
              practice imposition? You see here it is then, The wiley agent meets the parent or the
              trustee again: and tells him: it won't cost you a cent. Give us your old books, and we
              will exchange and give you new books for them; and it turnes out that the school has
              got worthless books; and the worst of this feature of the law is, that the trustee can
              perpetrate this imposition as often as he pleases.</p>
            <pb n="452" xml:id="VAA8558-14-452"/>
            <p>But how do we do? We say in section eight, that the County Superintendent with the
              Township Trustees and the School Trustees of the cities and towns, shall constitute a
              Board, with authority to make these changes in books and furniture, and without the
              consent of the Board no change can be made. Here we have the judgement of perhaps
              twelve men or more to control in these matters, instead of the judgement of one man.
              Is that better for the book or furniture agent ? I trust no man can say that it does
              not throw a protection around the people. Again: this section proposes, that when text
              books have been introduced they shall not be changed for three years. Gentlemen have
              tried to insist upon the idea that this bill is to induce a change at once: but they
              should be informed that this is groundless. The bill provides that this County Board
              shall considered the wants of the schools in regard to furniture, books, maps, charts,
              etc.: and all changes shall be made according to the directions of the Board, as far
              as practicable : and their authority is confined to their single county. But, of
              course, if the school is supplied with a set of books, the compliance is not
              practicable. Then it is provided that no change shall be made for three years.Is there
              any thing wrong in that? It says to the book agents, after the books have been once
              introduced: you need not go there any more for three years ; they can't change their
              books in that time. Then follows this provision; Shall not be changed in three years
              without the unanimous consent of the Board. This is the very question that was
              introduced at the time the provision was adopted: certainly gentlemen will not say,
              the Board will be unanimously corrupt.</p>

            <p>The Senate having under consideration Mr. Orr's bill [S. 117] regulating the granting
              of divorces, on the second reading - </p>
            <p>Mr. ORR said: I am free to say that I am not in favor altogether of the bill as
              reported by the Committee; but I shall vote for it believing it a much better law than
              the present one on our statute book.</p>
            <p>Mr. GOODING. I think that a great deal of unnecessary calumny has been cast upon the
              State of Indiana on account of this law. As has been said, it is not the fault of the
              law that there has been abuses, but the fault of the officers who executed the law. I
              would like to know if there ia any good reason for refusing to afford the protection
              of law to a man who has been here one year any more than to a man who has been here
              five? Is he not entitled to the protection of law to the same extent as though he had
              resided here for twenty years? I say then the fault is not in the law but in the
              frauds perpetrated under the law. A complaint is made that the courts are imposed upon
              by false evidence, yet we know that the law makes it the duty of the Prosecuting
              Attorney to appear and defend against all actions brought for divorce, and that the
              judge is to determine for himself whether he believes the witness or not. The Judge
              may say "I do not believe that witness;" and disregard the evidence.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS (interposing.) Has the Judge that right?</p>
            <p>Mr. GOODING. He has; he may believe or entirely disregard the evidence. I think it is
              a matter undenied in this country that there are more unlawful divorces granted in the
              city of New York than in the whole Stale of Indiana. This bill proposes that the Judge
              shall not believe a man on oath in court unless he is a freeholder. Who ever heard of
              the like before? I do not believe this Senate is prepared to say that a man cannot be
              believed on oath simply because he is not a freeholder. I think if the bill is
              referred to the Judiciary Committee with instructions to strike out the omnibus clause
              we will have a good divorce law.</p>
            <p>Mr. HALL. I have no doubt the people of Indiana will regard the statements made by
              the honorable gentleman, but in contrast to his statements as to whether our law is a
              good one or a bad one I request that this statement of Governor Baker, made in 1871,
              be placed alongside: "Some of the reproach that has been cast upon the State in this
              connection is doubtless undeserved; but a candid review of our laws and their
              practical operation on this important subject will, it is believed, satisfy any
              impartial mind, that a reformation is imperatively demanded:" (BREVIER LEGISLATIVE
              REPORTS, vol. XII, page 43.) Whether it requires a freeholder to stop this abuse or
              something else, let us <pb n="454" xml:id="VAA8558-14-454"/> have whatever it is;let
              us cast this reproach and shame from us. This thing of having any man from the street
              corner come up and swear that the applicant has been a resident of the State for a
              year should be done away with; and we should have men of sufficient character</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence (interrupting.) Does the Senator want it shall go to the
              country that because a man don't own land, he can't tell the truth?</p>
            <p>Mr. HALL. No, sir, but in Indianapolis there are men who could barter their souls
              away for a simple fee ; and there are men to be found in Vanderburgh and other
              counties that will do the same, but you can't find such commonly among men who have
              sufficient self respect to hold property.</p>
            <p>Mr. HUBBARD. It seems to me that the statement made by Governor Baker was made after
              careful consideration, and in view of the fact that the papers of the United States
              hold us up to scorn and our own press cannot successfully deny it, is enough to teach
              us that some reform is necessary. In my experience I have never known a divorce under
              that omnibus clause, nor have I seen but few attorneys that have used that omnibus
              clause. Only the other day a decision of the Supreme Court of Michigan was published,
              in which that tribunal has set aside and disregarded a decision made by one of the
              inferior courts of this State. They questioned it on the ground of residence,they said
              the residence in Indiana was a fraud according to the law of Michigan. They say that
              the party proving a residence in Indiana was committing a fraud ; not because the
              residence was required by the State, but because he had no residence here at all, and
              the courts of Indiana had no jurisdiction over the other party.</p>
            <p>Mr. O'BRIEN. I had hoped that gentlemen who seem to be so much opposed to this law
              would be filling to take a fair and square vote upon this bill. If gentlemen are well
              satisfied that the people are content with the law we now have, why don't they come in
              the Senate and vote in that way? Why undertake to refer this bill back to a committee
              confining the committee to instructions that do not avoid the very evil complained of
              all over the State of Indiana? It is begging the question to get this bill referred to
              a committee and thereby dodge the responsibility of what the people demand we should
              do to change our divorce law - which is a disgrace to Indiana. We ought to take a vote
              upon this bill - upon its merits. I am in favor of striking out the omnibus clause. It
              is under that our courts are continuously imposed upon. Let us require that proof be
              made by citizens who are responsible, so that if they testify falsely they can be
              dealt with. What can you do with a person in New York who sends a deposition out here
              swearing that the plaintiff has been a resident here for a year? I say unless the
              court has some ground for disregarding the testimony of a witness - if the testimony
              is not contradicted a court can not refuse to grant a divorce.</p>
            <p>Mr. SLEETH. Owners of real estate are not transit persons, and for the reason that
              they are fixed and settled inhabitants they are taken to prove the residents of
              transient persons. And I must say to the Senator from Vanderburgh that this is not a
              new rule of evidence. Not many years ago the Senator himself could not have voted
              unless he had his name registered without resorting to this very class of persons. I
              have never known, where any evidence was required for the purpose of ascertaining a
              residence as in the case of the registry law, but what this is the rule usually
              resorted to. We cain't prove the residence of a transient person by transient persons;
              we have to take fixed residents to prove the residence of a transient person, I have
              known men to steal the seal of a notary public and manufacture depositions from
              beginning to end, upon which they would go into the courts of Indiana. And suppose a
              man goes into court with depositions in proper form, how can the court refuse to
              administer the law, when the facts necessary are proven? But suppose the law was in
              force and he required to bring on to the stand freeholders, he would have made but
              slow headway. Instead of one we should have two years residence and a different order
              of proving that residence. It is too convenient for a citizen of New York,
              Connecticut, or Ohio, to rent a room in a hotel or some country village, returning
              there month after month while living in some other State, and after the year expires
              come here and prove by some one that this is his residence. And the courts have to
              decide this question on the evidence. I have seen divorces granted* where there was no
              other cause than simply incompatibility of temperament. It depended on whether the
              Judge thought that was sufficient; if he did he must grant the divorce. That is
              another defect in the law.</p>
            <p>Mr. SLATER. No Senator has yet shown that there has been any injustice done by the
              leniency of this law. As for me I am in favor of meeting this question fair and
              square, and will vote against every provision in this bill. I think our divorce laws
              are just, and that no parties should be compelled to live together who do not desire
              to. It has been said that this land is the home of the oppressed, and if it is not the
              hardest kind of oppression to compel a man to live with a woman he does not want to, I
              don't <pb n="455" xml:id="VAA8558-14-455"/> what is. Our laws allow a man after the
              State six months to become a legal voter, and now to say by a new law that he shall
              not have the right to come into her courts under three years is proposing to deprive
              him too long from that privilege. I am in favor of voting the bill down.</p>
            <p>Mr. THOMPSON desired to offer the following amendment which was read for information:
              " Providing that except in cases of adultery and the commission of an infamous crime,
              no divorce shall be decreed upon petition filed within three years."</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS demanded a division of the question - see middle of second column, page
              146.</p>

          <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the special order, being the consideration of Mr.
            O'Brien's State Printing and Binding bill [S. 257] with the majority and minority
            reports thereon - the latter recommending the passage of Mr. Beardsley's bill [S. 245],
            to let the public printing to the lowest bidder, with sundry amendments. The question
            being on concurring in the report of the minority - </p>
          <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence said: These are unquestionably quite as important bills as
            will come before the Senate. I have noticed that it is difficult to make such amendments
            as ought to be made in open Senate, and I believe it preferable to refer these bills to
            some Committee. I believe these reports and bills ought to go to the <orgName>Judiciary
              Committee</orgName>, so that they may suggest such amendments as may be proper, and so
            believing I make the motion now to refer these reports and bills to the
              <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>.</p>
          <p>Mr. GLESSNER. My judgment is that we ought to decide in the Senate which system shall
            be adopted. One bill proposes to establish a printing office by the State, and the other
            to let it out on contract. It appears to me that we ought to have a test vote in the
            Senate, and after that refer the bill whic provides for the system adopted by the Senate
            to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee.</orgName>
          </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH suggested the reading of Mr. O'Brien's bill [S. 257] and it was read by the
            secretary.Mr. O'BRIEN. Mr. President: This matter has been before the Committee since
            the first of the present session - I might say since the commencement of the special
            session. It is known that the State has been largely swindled in the matter of public
            printing, for that is a matter of public record in the courts of justice. In examination
            of the subject I find that the State has been swindle by raised vouchers, and there is a
            suspicion that the State has been swindled by false affidavits. I believe the courts
            acquitted the accused of the charge - and the State has been swindled in the measurement
            of the amount of printing done, and been swindled by parties getting orders for printing
            through here, done at the expense of the State, with the State's material, which is as
            useless as dirt, and which has cost the State thousands of dollars. I refer particularly
            to the Adjutant General's report, which cost the State some eighty odd thousand
            dollars.</p>
          <p>I am no printer and don't profess any science in that direction but I am a practical
            business man and I know that when you put the business of the State in the hands of
            private parties you are liable to have advantage taken of the State, especially when you
            allow a man to act upon that which he is familiar with and that which no officer of the
              <pb n="457" xml:id="VAA8558-14-457"/> State is familiar with. This bill proposes no
            price except the usual prices for hands - under it the State simply pays for the work
            actually done. I have letters from the Secretary of State of Ohio; and from other States
            where they have been swindled under the contract system. The only way is to remove this
            matter where there will be no private ends to meet and make the men responsible upon an
            official bond to the State.</p>
          <p>Let any member of the Senate take up the Auditor's report: the Auditor of the State, in
            his last report, says that the State has been swindled out of one hundred and fifty
            thousand dollars - enough to buy any three printing offices in the State of Indiana. I
            would like to know where the State ever got a dollar back except from Mr. Conner who
            voluntarily refunded it. I think the Auditor might have increased that amount one
            hundred and fifty thousand dollars more and it would probably be nearer the truth. I
            think the State in the last ten years has been swindled out of three hundred thousand
            dollars in the item of printing alone, to say nothing about the amount on public
            buildings, of which there is no record. Now what is our duty ? We have lost that much
            money - there can be no question about it. The Auditor of States puts it at one hundred
            and fifty thousand dollars, and I think he is not half high enough in his figures. There
            is no remedy for the past - this money is gone. This thing occurs in various ways, and
            one of the ways is by a collusion between printers and stationers in the purchase of
            material by which twice and three times, and even as much as twelve prices, I think some
            of them said, has been paid by the State. Then there is the overmeasuring of work. The
            price fixed by law is about the sum paid to the type setters, and yet these State
            Printers have made immense fortunes. That law is wrong which discriminates against the
            printers, yet they have made money under it.</p>
          <p>But what I desire now to say is this that the adoption of the pending motion will not
            facilitate this matter. I know you cannot pass a law regulating the prices for public
            printing, any more than you can regulate the prices of meat or flour. It is fluctuating
            every year. Whenever you make a law seeking to regulate these prices you must
            discriminate against the printer or liable yourself to be swindled. For these reasons a
            majority of the Committee concluded to adopt a system which would give the State a
            responsible public printer, who should give a bond to the amount of fifty thousand
            dollars; then a supervisory Board, and make them responsible; and then compelling the
            Secretary of State to make a record of every item contracted for and the price paid. We
            have no law upon that subject now.</p>
          <p>Another thing provided for in this bill is the purchase of fuel and stationery. We have
            two or three laws on this subject - one providing that the Secretary, Treasurer and
            Auditor of State shall furnish the stationery. I am imformed that the Secretary, Auditor
            and Treasurer have wholly disregarded this law. In the matter of stationery for the
            General Assembly, the last Legislature cost the State seventeen thousand dollars, and
            the special session footed up about twelve thousand dollars in addition for the single
            item of stationery. Where are we drifting? Then there is another law which provides that
            the State Librarian shall purchase all the stationery for the use of himself and the
            General Assembly, and his certificate shall be sufficient authority to the Auditor of
            State to audit the account. There is a man who is given unlimited power to draw money
            out of the Treasury for stationery, fuel and any other service he may desire. Here are
            two sets of officers authorized to purchase stationery. Both officers exercise the
            right, and the State foots the bills. I provide that all this stationery shall be
            purchased by the supervisory Board.</p>
          <p>Another thing provided for is all the contracts for the repairs of public buildings;
            the contracts for repairing public buildings no one knows anything about. The State has
            been saved eight or ten thousand dollars recently on repairs of this old State House by
            the vigilence of some State officer.</p>
          <p>This bill provides another thing. That all the printing done at the expense of the
            State shall be done at the State's public printing office.</p>
          <p>I hope this Senate will not refer this bill back to a Committee without first
            expressing an opinion as to whether this thing shall continue. If we place the printing
            in the hands of private parties what is the effect of it ? They are hounding the
            Legislature to allow printing to be done at the expense of the State and documents are
            printed by the thousands when there is no law authorizing their distribution and they
            are never distributed. The State Auditor reports that the public printing for the past
            ten years has cost some four hundred and fifty-five thousand dollars, and adding eighty
            odd thousand dollars, the cost of printing the Adjutant General's report to this sum,
            would run that item up to five hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars, instead of four
            hundred and fifty-five thousand dollars as the Auditor has it, which makes this printing
            cost the State fifty-three thousand dollars per annum.I have talked to printers familiar
            with the business and they estimate the cost of an office at from fifteen to thirty
            thousand dol- <pb n="458" xml:id="VAA8558-14-458"/> lars - I believe two went over
            thirty thousand dollars - leaving a clear margin in any one year of twenty-three
            thousand dollars to run the office. -And I am told by men who know what such material
            costs and are familiar with the business who say that material for the State printing
            proper ought not to cost more than eight to ten thousand dollars at the very outside;
            yet we are paying forty-five thousand dollars for printing which I am satisfied we could
            procure by hiring the services of from three to five ordinary printers.</p>
          <p>I think the Senate ought to come to a vote on this question. I, for one, desire to know
            what Senators mean to do - whether they intend to lease this thing out a year longer or
            make somebody responsible. I have yet to find the first man who says this is not the
            plan to get out of this. I hope the Senate will send a bill to the Judiciary Committee
            that will do some good. The Committee concur in the report with the exception of Senator
            Beardsley, who introduced the other bill, and his adverse position was for the reason
            that he desired two drafts before the Senate.</p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. Taking what the Senator from Hamilton [Mr. O'Brien] has said as true, we
            are doing things pretty wild in this State, but he is altogether mistaken. The State
            Librarian is required to make an itemized statement of his expenditures to every
            Legislature. The honorable Senator further states that the State Librarian is authorized
            to improve this old State House and that there is no check upon him, whereas the truth
            is he can only expend money for the improvement of the State House grounds with the
            consent of the Auditor, Treasurer and Secretary of State. If he expends money without
            their concurrence, that is no argument against the law. There are just two things the
            Librarian has no check in - one is to employ firemen and another is to buy fuel; and his
            bills are to be paid when presented.</p>
          <p>The honorable Senator has labored long and loud to prove that the mode heretofore
            adopted has worked deleterious to the State. I presume every Senator believes that there
            should be some change in the matter of public printing. I have not examined the subject
            but will make one or two suggestions. If we purchase a press and employ a superintendent
            of public printing about six months in every two years there will be an abundance of
            printing to do; and then, sir, there will be about eighteen months the State will have
            comparatively no printing to do.</p>
          <p>Mr. O'BRIEN (interposing.) Who is to print the reports of the officers of State when
            the Legislature is not in session.</p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. I say there will be comparatively no printing - as compared with what
            there is to do during the session of the Legislature. During the session of the
            Legislature and immediately thereafter until the laws and journals are published and
            bound it will require a large force in this office to do the printing; but after that
            there will be a small amount of printing to do. Then printing material will waste away
            and become unfit for use - </p>
          <p>Mr. SLATER (interposing.) That's a mistake.</p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. I don't know anything about it. The Senator says he has made inquiries of
            gentlemen in other States where they do the printing by contract, and they say that the
            contract system is worse than a public printer; but it is a strange thing to me that a
            State cannot go into the market and let a contract for doing the public printing and get
            it done at a reasonable cost. It occurs to me that Senators should look at this question
            in the light: "How would I do it? If it were to be paid for out of my own pocket would I
            trust it to a hired man or would I let it out by contract?" I make these suggestions
            without knowing anything about it.</p>
          <p>Mr. HALL. I move to refer both bills and reports with the amendments suggested by the
            Committee on Printing to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, with instructions
            to report a bill providing that the State printing shall be let to the lowest
            responsible bidder.</p>
          <p>Mr. HARNEY. I think we ought to decide this question now. As has been remarked there
            have been outrageous frauds perpetrated under the contract system; and it originated
            from the fact that the men who let this contract didn't perform their duty. There is no
            reason why the public printing should not be done under the contract system cheaper than
            under any other system; the buying of a State printing office would open an avenue for
            more fraud than the other. The contract system has this advantage : in two years if it
            don't work well we can abandon it. It strikes me the best thing now is the contract
            system.</p>
          <p>Mr. STEELE. I am unprepared to vote for either of these bills. If there is anything
            better to be obtained I am anxious we shall do so. As far as furnishing a press for the
            State and running it is concerned, I am wholly unprepared to say what the cost will be ;
            and I think a large majority of the Senate are in the same fix. If this subject is sent
            to a committee with instructions to report a bill of course they will do so, but if they
            chose to report a bill different allow them to do it; we will then have these bills
            before the Senate and will be better prepared to adopt one or the other. I would be glad
            to see it referred <pb n="459" xml:id="VAA8558-14-459"/> to a select committee rather
            than to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> as I am a member of that Committee
            and would be glad to get rid of the responsibility for I feel myself incompetent. At any
            rate I think we had better refer these bills to some Committee, and not tie it down to
            these two particular bills, but allow it to report such a bill as in its judgement may
            seem best.</p>
          <p>Mr. SLATER. This <orgName>Committee on Printing</orgName> has been considering this
            subject for weeks. They are in earnest in this matter. They desire some reform, they
            think some money can be saved to the State in this matter of the public printing. They
            have examined into these propositions and thoroughly canvassed the matter in every
            manner possible; and if a reform is desired we think the bill reported by the Committee
            should be passed. If it is the wish and desire of the Senate, as it seems to be, to
            throw overboard all the work that this Committee has done, I can't see the necessity of
            it, here has been a great amount of labor expended on this bill, and I don't think any
            better plan can be devised than the one we have hit on. The disposition to refer this
            subject back to a Committee seems to me like an effort to strangle this bill. It seems
            to me there is a disposition here not to give to the people what they desirea reform in
            this public printing business. I would like to have the Senate act decisively upon these
            bills.</p>
          <p>Mr. O'BRIEN. The Senator from Jasper [Mr. Dwiggins,] called me to an account for my
            statement that the purchase of stationary by the State Librarian was unlimited by law,
            and I have seen nothing in the Statutes to change my view since. [Mr. O'Brien reads from
            the Revised Statutes.]</p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS (interposing) that has been repealed.</p>
          <p>Mr. O'BRIEN. I should like to see it, unless the Senator finds a more recent Statute I
            shall insist that I am correct. I may have overlooked a repealing Statute. If this most
            important reform in the State government has been overlooked they must have had a large
            amount of business on their hands, or they must be somewhat negligent. This matter has
            been considered by the <orgName>Committee on Printing</orgName> since the first of the
            special session, and now the proposition of these gentlemen who are unprepared to vote
            is that these bills shall be sent to a large Committee which has already a great amount
            of business before it. I have no objections to a reference to that Committee for a legal
            opinion, but I think the Senate should say whether they will or will not adopt one or
            the other system.</p>
          <p>Mr. STEELE. In considering the purchase of a press did the Committee take into
            consideration the purchasing of sufficient room or a building?</p>
          <p>Mr. O'BRIEN. I will state to the Senate that the Commitee have estimates upon all these
            questions, we are informed that a suitable building can be rented at from twelve to
            fifteen hundred dollars a year. We make an appropration of two thousand dollars or as
            much as may be necessary. We have estimates for the purchase of an office at from
            thirteen thousand to twenty thousand dollars - generally about twenty thousand dollars.
            We place this in the hands of officers of State who are responsible for the purchase at
            a reasonable price. Then we appropriate fifteen thousand dollars for the annual expenses
            of the office. The estimates are carefully made, I have taken men disinterested, as far
            as I know and these are the estimates.</p>
          <p>Mr. STEELE. Suppose we adopt the other system and elect a Commissioner of Printing to
            assist the Govoner, Secretary and Treasurer of State to do this work at the least
            possible cost to the State.</p>
          <p>Mr O'BRIEN. That system has been tried in Ohio but it has proved unsatisfactory. I
            think this bill is as well guarded as it can be. It appropriates two thousand dollars
            for contingent expenses. If these bills are thrown into the Lands of a new Committee you
            had better throw away the entire work of this printing Committee.</p>
          <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence. I do not wish to be considered as reflecting on the Committee
            by my motion. The Committee have been unable to come to a conclusion among themselves. I
            find two reports from this Committee and simply because they do not agree, I conclude it
            would be better to refer this matter to another Committee. I am ready if it desirable,
            to vote upon these bills now, but I am not ready to vote for the bill of the Senator
            from Hamilton [Mr. O'Brien,] which provides for an appropriation out of the treasury of
            fifty-two thousand eight hundred dollars. I think in the end it would cost more than
            ever, notwithstanding the wrongs the State has suffered at the hands of State
            Printers.</p>
          <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. It is useless to send both bills to a Committee. The Senate should decide
            which one it is in favor of. I am satisfied that the contract system is the best. It is
            far preferable. In 1867, the State Board of Agriculture applied to the Legislature for
            an appropriation for the publication of their reports - asking the Legislature to give
            them the right to make their own contract. A bill was passed appropriating three
            thousand dollars for the year 1867 and 1868, but omitted to say that in 1868 they should
            have the right to contract for the printing; so in 1868 the State Printer done <pb
              n="460" xml:id="VAA8558-14-460"/> it. Here are the books (holding them up in his
            hands.) In 1867 they got three thousand five-hundred cuts and six hundred and ninety
            seven pages printed for three thousand dollars, being let to the lowest bidder; and in
            1868 they got four hundred and ninety two pages with twenty-five or six hundred cutsone
            thousand ten cuts and two hundred pages less, cost the same price when done by the State
            Printer. That is an argument in favor of letting the public Printing to the lowest
            responsible bidder.</p>

            the best thing the Senate could do would be to set these bills for a day certain, make
            the subject a special order and have a free discussion. I don't wish to be considered as
            committed to either one of these propositions. I vote "aye."</p>
          <p>Mr. NEFF, when his name was called in explanation of his vote said : I am really like
            the Senator from Vanderburg [Mr. Gooding,] unprepared to vote on the question before us,
            I really don't know whether the provisions of either bill suits me. I should like, for
            the purpose of qualifiing myself to vote intelligently, to see both bills printed. I
            don't know which system is the best calculated to prevent the State from being swindled.

          <p>Mr. SCOTT, when his name was called said : I know very little about the merits of this

            Senators other than members of that Committee know anything about the merits of it, and

              <div type="resolution">
                <p><hi rend="sc">RESOLVED,</hi> That it is the sense of this House that a special
                  tax be levied and collected annually - to constitute a separate fund for the
                  purpose of building a New State House; and that the Committee on Ways and Means be
                  directed to re port a bill for that purpose.</p>
              </div>
            </body>
          </floatingText>
          <p>Mr. W. said: I had supposed that the Legislature was ready to begin the building of a
            new State House; and the other day, when I suggested that there ought to be a tax levied
            to raise a special fund for this purpose, the gentleman from Jefferson [Mr. Branham]
            declared it out of the question. I think the State House ought to be built without
            borrowing any money for the purpose: and I believe if the people were consulted, they
            would be in favor of proceeding in this way; and I still believe it is the sentiment of
            the House that the State House can be built by levying a tax for a fund ready to pay the
            expenses - I believe they are in favor of building a new State House. Now, sir, the
            proposition is to levy a tax of three cents on the hundred dollars of taxables for a
            ready fund for the Treasury that would pay every dollar of the expense of the House by
            the time it shall be completed. The proposed three cents levy would raise two hundred
            and fifty or three hundred thousand dollars a year.</p>
          <p>The objection of the gentleman from Jefferson, was, that the money would lie in the
            Treasury for too long a time after its collection and before it would be required. But
            it seems to me that the surplus funds of the State should be carefully loaned so that
            the Treasury might have the benefit of the interest.</p>
          <p>In the next place we might consider that if this tax were levied, the first collection
            would be in June, 1874. Then in January 1875, upon the meeting of the next Legislature
            they would find in the Treasury a fund for the new State House of two hundred and fifty
            to three hundred thousand dollars, which would enable them to make an appropriation for
            the expenses of the House. And so the House might be erected by the people and they
            would hardly know that they had been taxed for it. But if you mingle it with other funds
            we shall at the end of the year find ourselves without any money for the purpose. I
            would make it a special fund: I would say, that is the State House Fund. Let every tax
            payer know that he is paying three cents on every hundred dollars for a New State House,
            and in my opinion he would not complain.</p>
          <p>Mr. CAUTHORN (interposing.) Who would use the money till the building might be
            commenced ?</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. We should have a place to put it; and the people should have the interest.
            It would come into the Treasury in June, and the expenditure of it would <pb n="462"
              xml:id="VAA8558-14-462"/> begin in the January following. Should I say anything in
            regard to the necessity of a State House? Two years ago I sat here; and then this State
            House was regarded as a nuisance. The people are not behind the politicians in this
            matter of public improvements. I have seen it tried; and the people are always in
            advance of the public men. It is so with reference to the rebuilding of a Court House;
            and so it will be with reference to this new State House. I believe that the proper mode
            is to put this money into the shape proposed; and then the representatives of the people
            before the work is begun, will have a sufficient amount to begin with; and then
            afterwards we should provide so as to keep up a sufficient amount to continue its
            erection.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. Is this resolution imperative ?</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. Yes.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. Mr. Speaker; I would like to ask the Chairman of the <orgName>Committee on
              Ways and Means</orgName>, what will be the probable deficit in the State revenue this
            year ?Mr. WOOLLEN. There is always a deficit in the Treasury.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. That does not answer nor alter my question. I ask the chairman of the
            Committee this: After the ordinary expenses of the State shall be paid, what will be the
            probable deficiency ?</p>
          <p>Mr. KIMBALL. The estimates are not completed, but the deficiency must be considerable.
            There should be about one hundred thousand dollars in the Treasury; and perhaps the
            expenses of the State will be about one million. The revenue to be paid in at the May
            settlement will be three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. The large deficit may be
            run down to about three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. I want the House to remember that this is for the ordinary expenses of the
            State government - not a dollar for the asylums - not a dollar for anything else. I
            think gentlemen should be willing to look this matter in the face, and ask themselves
            to-day what we are talking about. I think I know about as much about the liberality of
            the people as any man of my opportunities for observation; and I do not think the House
            ought to drift with the idea, that the Treasury will meet even the ordinary expenses of
            the State without extraordinary effort. I think the vote of the House yesterday was
            conclusive against beginning the State House before we enlarge the Asylum. True, I voted
            for the enlargement of the Asylum, but I objected that the House should not do that
            before we reported this bill. It is certain that the tax levy has got to be raised, but
            I can't say how much.</p>
          <p>Mr. KIMBALL. It cannot be less than fifteen cents on the hundred dollars.</p>
          <p>Mr. CAUTHORN. Mr. Speaker, I give notice that there will be a division of this
            question. I shall move to refer this matter to a special committee of five.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. That can't alter the question. It does not make a bit of difference
            whether it is a general or a special levy,, whether it is for a State House or any other
            public improvement - its the aggregate of all these levies that makes the burden - and
            while the State may make it reasonable, the counties may make it excessive. I want to
            know only how much you propose to take away from the State.</p>
          <p>But there is another view. It Is apprehended by some that this measure will constitute
            a hind to be loaned to some banking institute therefore I say distinctly that I do not
            propose to raise a fund for banking. I have been always inclined to think that the
            people are the safest custodians of their own money. I do not care much about this State
            House matter, I say, however, that the preliminary steps ought to be taken, and that
            they are just as necessary as any other for the healthy action of the State. You say
            that you want to adopt a plan and that the House should give this subject into the hands
            of five men; and if the House would be willing to trust it to them I might be willing to
            take the suggestion; but if I were the House of Representatives I would not do so. We
            have estimates for this building varying from one million five hundred thousand to seven
            million dollars. Then ought not the House first to ascertain within a reasonable figure
            what that certain amount of cost will be? The object of the resolution yesterday was to
            put it into the power of the House to begin the work; but as that was voted down I think
            we had better let the matter of commencing the work go over.</p>
          <p>But what I want is this : the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means thinks we
            shall require a levy of fifteen cents on the hundred dollars. And this does not touch
            the matter of the enlargement of the insane Asylum. If I could credit gentlemen for
            sincerity, I might say that it seems that they would be willing to give their per diem
            here for the enlargement of the Asylum. The State expenses will be near a million. The
            insane Asylum will require sixty-five thousand dollars which ought to be voted now, for
            the reason that with this enlargement you can accommodate more patients with less money
            per capita. The Reformatory at Plainfield must have fifty-five thousand dollars, for I
            believe we have already voted this Reformatory fifty thousand dollars. The University at
            Bloomington asks for forty thousand dollars, and the Normal School <pb n="563"
              xml:id="VAA8558-14-463"/> at Terre Haute is also in a bad fix, and would trouble the
            House for (I think it is) one hundred thousand dollars. Then there is the University at
            Lafayette which we named for Mr. John Perdue, asking for a few thousand dollars to
            complete her buildings, at least a hundred thousand more. The Soldiers' Home need money
            - a large sum - and they say they must have it. And thus we get an insight into what
            will put your levy up to twenty cents on the hundred dollars; and there should be, and
            there is no necessity for any levy beyond this - to raise money to be loaned to the
            banks - for the benefit of the banks - so long as the people themselves are better and
            safer custodians of their own funds. We have already once determined this question; and
            there is not a man on this floor who would increase it beyond twenty cents.</p>
          <p>Mr. HENDERSON spoke for the adoption of the resolution but found that the payment of
            the unsurrendered Canal bonds (which he would have withheld) would be fatal to it. He
            insisted on the ability of the State to erect a creditable State House, which has been
            so many years contemplated, and is greatly needed, answered objections, and insisted on
            raising a fund for the beginning of the work.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. Every time the gentlemen from Jefferson [Mr. Branham,] meets a question of
            taxation here, to which he is opposed, he comes in and opens his Pandora's Box of evils
            and lets them fly all over the House. [Laughter] - Mr. Speaker, this proposed new State
            House is a great want of the State, and one of these days, it will be built. And the cry
            upon this floor, that the people are not able and willing to build a new State House
            when this old pile is tumbling about our ears is not ingenuously made. There are two
            causes for the present deficit in the Treasury: the putting down of the last years' levy
            to five cents, and the payment of the Wabash and Erie Canal Bonds, and if it had not
            been for these there would have been no deficiency. It has been but a few years ago when
            the levy was twenty-five cents on the hundred dollars: and the people did not complain
            of that any more than for the five cents. The putting down of the levy to five cents for
            1871 did not make a vote for the democratic ticket: and I have no doubt now, that if
            this General Assembly should raise the levy sufficiently to build the State House and
            provide for the Benevolent Institutions the people would sustain it cheerfully. It is
            not a question of party but of right and duty; and therefore the people will endorse it.
            Again the gentleman from Jefferson says we want to raise this fund specially for the
            purpose of loaning it to the banks. But the gentleman knows gentlemen all know that it
            would not be neither right nor politic to tax for any such purpose. Still what does the
            gentlemen propose as a remedy for this evil thing of raising money by taxation ? Has he
            the magic power to put his hand into the pockets of the people and take out money for
            the State improvements when he wants it? Is there any railroad speed by which he can
            raise this money? Suppose we do not provide this fund in the next two years, what would
            be the condition of the next General Assembly? Where will be the State's money two years
            hence to begin the new State House ? Will not the Treasury be just as empty then as it
            is now? Then why not provide for this tax for a special fund so as to have it on hand a
            few months before it will be needed for use? I say provide a tax that will gradually
            raise the fund for the beginning and the continuance of the building: so that when it
            shall be completed it will be paid for ? I am in favor of making this a special tax for
            the purpose of being able to point out to the people the object of the fund for which
            the money is collected; and of letting them see that it is expended for that
            purpose.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. I wish to ask the Chairman of the proper Committee whether that Pandora's
            Box contained anything but facts? If not, then, instead of being a bug-bear, its a
            stubborn reality. - With respect to this old State House building, with a few
            exceptions, the foundations of it are as good as when it was built fourty years ago.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. Does the gentleman remember that this dome tumbled in a few years ago?</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. I helped about the pulling out of the debris; but it is now just as safe
            as it can be. - I do not wish to interfere with the schemes of the gentleman
            particulary: but there are broader views than he has advanced. I will ask the gentleman
            from Johnson [Mr. Woollen,] what are the great needs of the State of Indiana to-day? and
            what is it that this House is called upon most earnestly to consider in this connection
            ? Sir, its the high price of money. No man can borrow money, paying the rate of interest
            demanded by the banks at present, and carry on business successfully for any great
            length of time. - Now sir, what is to be the effect of this intended Legislation upon
            the principal of taxing everybody and everything ? It will be to keep out of the State
            the capital of other States, what we want is the development of our mineral resourses.
            Is any man insane enough to think we can pay fifteen per cent, for money? We have passed
            through ten years of extraordinary times which have taxed our people to their utmost -
            more than we expected they would be able <pb n="464" xml:id="VAA8558-14-464"/> to bear.
            I advocated for sometime that principle of paying off our foreign debt; and we taxed our
            people to the very fullest extent that ought to have been attempted. We wiped out that
            debt and I would like to see the remainder, the House debt, put on this bill. That is my
            way: pay as you go. I may be very slow to apprehend danger in this hall,that it would
            fall down and kill somebody - especially myself - and I might even doubt as to the
            question whether in that event the State would be injured or not. [Laughter.] I am not
            opposed to making respectable appropriations for the State House, but I am opposed to
            raising this fund before 1875.</p>
          <p>Mr. CAUTHORN, submitted the following as an amendment by way of substitute: for the
            resolution of Mr. Woollen:</p>
          <floatingText>
            <body>
              <div type="resolution">
                <p><hi rend="sc">WHEREAS</hi>, The present State House is old and insecure, and
                  there is a public demand that a new State House should be erected without delay;
                  thereforee</p>
                <p><hi rend="sc">RESOLVED</hi>, That a Select Committee of five be appointed to
                  devise ways and means for the erection of a new State House; and report by bill or
                  otherwise.</p>
              </div>
            </body>
          </floatingText>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. If the House think that is better I will withdraw mine and accept
            that.</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT. I do not know Mr. Speaker, whether I am in favor of the substitute or of
            the original resolution. The main question is whether we propose to take steps for
            building a new State House at this Session. I must say that, I have some pride of
            feeling about it - I would be proud of a good State House, this Capital City deserves
            it. I came here with an impression that steps would be taken in that direction; but I
            did not know then all the demands that would be made upon the Legislature in the way of
            money. I have learned many things since that time; and my mind is changing upon this
            subject of a new State House. In fact this old House looks better to me than it did when
            I first came into it, and I should hate to see this old pile torn down. It has been
            covering the heads of our solons perhaps well enough, while the State has grown to be
            what she is to-day, and I do not know that a new one would improve the quality of our
            laws, or improve the morals of our citizens, or advance the educational interest of our
            State or elevate the temperance standard. I do not know that it would elevate anything,
            except perhaps this outer dome: and perhaps there is not much necessity for that now. I
            do not know what practical good could come of it. It is simply a question of pride and
            should we expend money for that ? There is certainly an extraordinary demand for money
            appropriations at this time. Our Benevolent Institutions which were erected before the
            war, and which for many years have made the State famous, are now falling behind, and
            becoming insufficient for the wants of the people. The Insane Asylum, particularly needs
            an expensive enlargement. I can refer back to what has been done in my own County, for
            this class of paupers, in what is called the crazy house,a department of the poor-house,
            where there have been two beings confined, - females - ,One of them for sixteen years
            and the other for a longer period. These things ought not so to be: they are simply
            outrageous: something ought to be done immediately for this class of beings, and delays
            should not be tolerated. I am ready and willing to vote for any reasonable appropriation
            to take care of all the Insane of the State. Another matter has been referred to here as
            an objection to this proposition: a majority of the General Assembly have been willing
            to vote money to pay the unsurrendered Canal Bonds, and it is said that if we had not
            done that we might have had plenty of money now. But I do not think that argument is
            applicable. I conceived when I voted for that, that I was voting for the State to pay
            her honest debts for which she was responsible at law. There is a difference between
            voting money to pay the State's indebtedness and voting money to make the State
            magnificent: and it also seemed to me that it was voting to pay money at the close of
            the day of grace. I believed that it could not be postponed.</p>
          <p>Mr. CAUTHORN (interposing.) How long did these men hold their bonds to avoid receiving
            their just dues ?</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT. No time at all after they became due. Suits were at once instituted upon
            them. But it has been said upon this floor, that for the last ten years we have taxed
            the people of the State of Indiana to their utmost ability to paythat we have been
            passing through extraordinary times and that the people are trying to recover from the
            burdens of taxes that have been thrown upon them ; and that therefore it would be
            imprudent now to make any unnecessary increase of the levy:and to this I agree. When we
            shall have escaped from the effects of our war-tax, and when we shall have properly
            built up our benevolent Institutions, then it will be time enough to think of a new
            State House. I confess I would rather have voted for the resolution offered yesterday
            than for either of those offered to-day. I believe, however, with the gentleman from
            Johnson that it would be better to have the money, before we spend it.</p>
          <p>Mr. WALKER (humorously.) The gentleman from Delaware has developed well for a man who
            was in doubt when he began.</p>
          <pb n="465" xml:id="VAA8558-14-465"/>
          <p>Mr. HENDERSON. The gentleman has progressed rapidly from the Special Session to the
            Regular Session. I do not know whether the Canal bonds are just or not, but we who were
            opposed to their payment were told that we were repudiators - that the State was rich
            and ought to pay them ; but now we learn to-day that the State of Indiana is becoming
            very poor - now comes the Pandemonium box of evils (laughter) which the gentleman from
            Jefferson has poured out upon us (laughter continued, and voices: "Pandora's box.") I
            insist that the State of Indiana wants a State House and the people are able to build
            it.</p>
          <p>Mr. COBB. I am in favor of this resolution. I think all the objections which have been
            waged against this bill can be easily answered, and if those which we have heard are the
            only objections which can be urged against this resolution it seems to me that there is
            no reason why we should not take some steps toward the construction of a new State House
            at this session. In fact it seems to me a most important duty. The gentleman from
            Jefferson [Mr. Branham] talks of the people being the safest custodians of the public
            funds, and I think he is correct. Still I think there is another proposition equally
            true ; that when the people have to raise a certain amount of money they can more easily
            do it in four or five years than they can do it at once. I would be in favor of creating
            this certain State house fund setting it apart for this special purpose ; and I would
            have it deposited where it would bring a reasonable interest - increasing it till we
            need it - so secured that it may be continually growing. Gentlemen make their loud
            pleadings for the care of the incurable Insane; and of course that is a public interest
            which ought to be looked after: and I am forced to think that there must be a little
            inhumanity existing amongst the Boards of Commissioners of some of the Counties.
            Fortunately, in my county we have no need of this hospital improvement to take care of
            our Insane. We have some, however, to take care of; and I think our County Commissioners
            know and do their duty to them. But the fact that there are cases where these
            unfortunate people are confined for years together in such loathsome places should not
            appeal to the people in vain. But sir, we have a comfortable place for such persons in
            our county: we have too much humanity to allow them to be treated as the honorable
            gentleman has described. I confess that I feel a horror for such a confinement of these
            unfortunate persons. There is reason for public inquiry as to whether they are properly
            treated ; for I know that some have been deprived of heir liberty in those, places known
            among the counties as the place for the incurable Insane - it is called the public
            mad-house where no doubt great wrong is done to the reputation of the people of the
            State. I say sir, that we ought to provide well for all the benevolent institutions ;
            for the House can remember that these institutions were commenced and carried on to
            their present state of completion at a time when the State could hardly pay the interest
            on the money yet, notwithstanding, the people entered upon the work and carried it
            through without a murmur; and I feel that we would be unworthy of the State of Indiana,
            if we were to hold back these appropriations now.</p>
          <p>The people sir, are always willing to pay their money whenever they get something for
            it. Now I think that it is wise for the General Assembly to do something for a new State
            House. And I would say let us commence in time so that we may go on to its completion
            without any jog - and especially without any magnficent stealing in the case. I would be
            glad to see the work well begun and three million dollars will make a tolerable
            structure. I don't care whether we have to make a levy of five cents or ten or twenty
            cents on the hundred dollars. I am only careful that the funds be well applied. I do
            hope that this resolution or some similar resolution will pass, - that we will create a
            cumulating fund, and that it will be so secure that no individual man can make his
            personal game out of it. Let us do this and say to our constituents that we have done
            the best we could under the circumstances.</p>
          <p>Mr. THOMPSON of Elkhart. When the gentleman from Delaware [Mr. Mellett] took his seat
            here at the beginning of the Special Session, he did not want to trust himself under
            this venerable pile, but now, since he has got to looking after the interests of
            education, that is all right, but now the people are looking for us to make a start for
            the erection of a new capitol building. For my part I would not levy a special tax - I
            would issue the bonds of the State for this purpose.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM in his seat. Consent.</p>
          <p>Mr. THMPSON. That is the best way. These bonds of the State of Indiana could be sold at
            six to eight per cent. - and the proceeds could be deposited in the bank. There is no
            safer deposit for individuals than the banks of the State. Thus we could raise a fund
            for this purpose and the people would not feel it. We know that all the wants of the
            people come up here, and we are called upon to meet them. I feel disposed sir, to
            inaugruate a scheme to erect a State House; and I am perfectly willing that the plan
            should be left to the Committee - the plan for a beginning; for it must be some time
            before the work can be com-30 <pb n="466" xml:id="VAA8558-14-466"/> pleted. The people
            are looking for some thing to be done in this direction. As to the tax that was levied
            two years ago, everybody who knows anything about State affairs must know that four
            cents levy was entirely insufficient and every such man must know also that we are
            expected to raise the levy to at least fifteen cents. I do not pretend to know what was
            the object two years ago of that reduction of the levy; but I do know that the people
            are expecting the levy to be raised now. They expect this improvement of the Insane
            Asylum and the commencement of a new State House - thus two important things they expect
            and demand of us.</p>
          <p>VOICES. Question, question.</p>
          <p>Mr. CAUTHORN. As I introduced this resolution I think it is proper that I should say a
            word or two about it. I am not going to follow those gentlemen who talk about the fact
            whether we need a new State House or not; for all the facts are in the possesion of the
            House, I think we need a new State House myself; and I think the people think so. Now
            Mr. Speaker, as to the means of building this State House. I do not think it would be
            right to levy a tax at all, for this purpose. A State House should last at least for a
            century and let posterity help to pay for it. We can get this money by issuing State
            bonds and allowing the people to pay the interest annually and the principal at some
            future day. We know that the State of Indiana is progressive.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRETT (interposing.) Does not the Constitution prohibit the General Assembly from
            contracting a debt ?</p>
          <p>Mr. CAUTHORN. Not for this purpose. We can raise the money in this wayso that we need
            not put the whole burden of this fund upon those who will use the money. I am in favor
            of the bill introduced by the gentleman from Johnson [Mr. Woollen,] which provides that
            all the unused public money shall be loaned out for the benefit of the State. It is true
            that we have a law that prohibits the loaning of the public money for individual
            benefit, and honest men will be governed by this law, but some men will avoid it. Then I
            would have this law and I would have this bill introduced so that the proposed work
            could be commenced in the spring; and herein also is the reason why I prefer a Special
            Committee of five.</p>
          <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH. I think sir, that the sentiment of those I represent here is in favor
            of a new State House. They desire at least that some initial step should be taken at
            once - for a new State House that as will be a credit to the State and to this city the
            capitol of the State - one that will advertise this city. For what is it that gives
            prominence to the State of Illinois like the great city of Chicago? And what is it that
            gives prominence to Ohio like the great cities of that State, and I am not glorifying
            these cites especially, but the credit which they have for permanent buildings. We want
            a State House that will stand for a century; and we do not want to wait until these
            crumbling walls shall fall. And we do not want such a structure a this which was built
            in the times of log cabins. We are not poor - we can pay our honest dues. I repudiate
            the idea that Indiana cannot pay her honest debts and build a new State house too. I am
            in no hurry about this but I would not adjourn without making a beginning. If the people
            of Marion County can afford one million five-hundred thousand dollars for a Court house,
            can't we afford to put two million dollars into a State Capitol ? - Let us put the
            building in process of construction - let us begin let us do something. We can do a
            little building for the Insane Asylum and we can cut short the educational
            appropriations. Let us do what we can-afford to do toward the beginning of a building
            that will make this capitol a credit to us.</p>
          <p>Mr. OFFUTT. lu common with other members of the House, I feel some interest in this
            question. I have no plan to suggest toward the building of a new State House, nor as to
            the manner of raising this fund. I know that we ought to have a new State House: for if
            a new building is not erected soon, this pile of ruins will come down upon the wisdom of
            the State and bankrupt it in a short time. [Laughter] It seems to me that out of the
            present assembled wisdom of the great State of Indiana, we ought to educe something in
            the way of a new State House. Now without attempting to suggest any plan for the
            building or for the raising of the proposed fund, it occurs to me that if the building
            is to be erected at all, there must be a fund to commence with. There can be no question
            about the necessity for that. Every man having the good of the State at heart and
            looking at this old structure must come to the conclusion that there ought to be
            something better in its stead. There is only one way in which to do this, and that is by
            creating a fund for that special purpose, and if the General Assembly comes to the
            conclusion that a new State House ought to be erected they must provide the manner in
            which that fund must be raised, I am decidly in favor of a new building. There has been
            a good deal of cheap capitol made by advocating petty measures of economy which could be
            easily brought to the notice of the people But now it is not economy to put off this
            matter any <pb n="467" xml:id="VAA8558-14-467"/> longer; and I hope the House will have
            the courage to pass this necessary bill to create this fund for the beginning of a new
            building.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRETT. I am a little surprised at the remarks of gentlemen in favor of this bill
            who are ordinarily disposed to be economical. Some of them seem to allege that a member
            here can evince no patriotism unless he is in favor of every proposed expenditure of the
            public money. I acknowledge Mr. Speaker, that I am guarded and cautious about every vote
            of mine which is to increase the taxes of the people; and if that is making cheap
            capital then I am in that business, sir, I have been much in a position that has brought
            me into contact with the people who have to pay the taxes; and I have seen people pay
            their taxes with money to produce which it required that the meat should be sold which
            was provided for their daily food. I have seen the cow sold for this purpose, which
            ought to have been kept for the use of the family. The gentleman from Knox [Mr.
            Cauthorn,] has suggested that a great portion of this burden can be thrown upon
            posterity - that we can do this job on time - but, sir, we have had some specimens of
            the gentleman's idea of incurring public debts heretofore. Our ancestors heretofore
            contracted a debt for the purposes of internal improvements; and the State was dotted
            all over with public works in process of completion but not one of them completed : and
            the result was that it threw the State into bankruptcy, and it was suddenly found out
            that all these works that had cost millions of dollars were not worth half their cost. I
            will now read to the House the fifth section of Article ten of the Constitution of the
            State. "No law shall authorize any debt to be contracted, on behalf of the State except
            in the following cases: to meet casual deficits in the revenue; to pay the interest on
            the State debt; to repel invasion, suppress insurrection, or, if hostilities be
            threatened to provide for the public defence." I believe there is nothing here to
            authorize the legislature to contract a public debt for the purpose of building a State
            House or any other house, and of course gentlemen will understand it so, and when they
            come to vote on the question they will do so with the knowledge that the expense which
            their votes will devolve upon the State will have to be remembered in this day and
            generation ; and now with this understanding, shall we build a new State House? The
            resolution was rejected - yeas 33 nays 54. [Seepages 154 and 155.]</p>

          <p>When Mr. Thompson's bill [S. 94,] providing that in cities having incorporated homes
            for friendless women, all fines collected on account of and for the breach of any
            ordinance for the suppression of vice, shall be paid to the trustees of such homes for
            the maintenance and support was read the third time - </p>
          <p>Mr. THOMPSON said: These homes for friendless women, established in several of our
            cities by the Christian benevolence of generous citizens, are worthy of the intelligent
            consideration of this venerable Senate. The object appeals to the kindest feelings of
            every Senator. We all understand how frail and helpless are females, when by necessity,
            perhaps from the death of legal protectors, they are driven from home to meet the
            temptations, the hardships, the toils and the pinching poverty of our exacting world.
            They come from all parts of the country up to the cities, innocent as angels, without
            experience, seldom educated, and knock at every door for employment. How their shrinking
            natures sink into despondency when they discover how few, very few of the pursuits of
            life are open to their sex and that public opinion, like a sword of wrath is guarding
            every avenue to the more manly callings from their touch.</p>
          <p>And now, deprived of home, parents, friends, and even public prejudice turned against
            them, they ask, yea, often beg, to become the hired servants, and to perform all the
            most menial duties of housekeeping. This is often denied them in heartless language.
            Thus repelled, as may be from every door, aching disappointment drives them in the way
            of temptation and presents them with crime as the only door open by which they may
            escape harsh treatment of soulless employes. The mind frienzied into desperation, often
            gives way to temptation for the sake of promised relief. They find the seducer on their
            track - a character who revels in the downfall of angels, and only lives to blacken and
            scathe with his polution heavens most precious gift to the human race - beautiful woman!
            He is full of promises; with flattery to caress and with money to relieve, they become
            his dupes, and after he has accomplished his infernal purposes, he turns his back upon
            his imploring victims and rejoices in the overthrow of all that is lovely in female
            innocence and virtue; and society finds more objects on which to lavish its scorn, its
            dread, its fearful opposition. On our highways they stand, broken hearted, beseeching
            for mercy. Their language, as has been thrown into old poetry, by some one, and it is
            also their prayer, is as follows :</p>
          <lg type="free">
            <l>"O where shall I go or what shall I do, I have no one to tell me what course to
              pursue,</l>

            <pb n="469" xml:id="VAA8558-14-469"/>
            <l>I know not what shelter this night I may seek.</l>
            <l>Oh! Friend of all friends, who rules earth and sea,</l>
            <l>Look down with thy pittying eyes upon me,</l>
            <l>I will wander alone till thy messenger comes</l>
            <l>To take me to father and mother at home."</l>
          </lg>
          <p>Mr. President: Would that some of the bright minds around me had relieved me of the
            task of supporting this bill: - some one of these distinguished lawyers, who, while
            their comprehensive minds would be able to present the merits of the bill, could hold
            the sorrowful emotions of the heart still while the tongue would relate the sad, sad
            story of the downfall of lovely woman. They have been abandoned by faithless husbands or
            perhaps, their own beautiful, happy homes have been turned into very hells by the demon
            of intemperance; or perhaps deserted by lover and friend, they fill up the ranks of
            despised and rejected women; of all classes the most hopeless, and the least likely to
            return to the pursuits of industry or the more sober walks of life without
            assistance.</p>
          <p>What but the tongue of an angel could enumerate the manifold sources from which spring
            the downfall of woman ? And I have thought that nothing but the power of deity could
            turn the attention of legislators to hear her agonizing appeals for mercy, and with the
            power of the State grant relief to this long despised class of females, by affordting a
            home where her weary, sorrowing body may find rest until loving hands shall bind up her
            wounds, and the gospel of the Son of God shall renew the heart and restore the mind.</p>
          <p>The gay dashing prodigal may take up his wealth and journey into a far country and
            there, or at home, may spend his patrimony in riotous living. He may sink down through
            the haunts of vice until swine shall be his companions and husks his living. But then,
            covered with rags and dripping with the slime of iniquity he may return to home, and to
            friends, hear the plaudits of welcome, receive the best robe, grace the head of the
            feast, and lead out the dance, under the sound of the tymbal and harp. But poor,
            friendless, and fallen woman has no home or friends to receive her. And though
            repentence may flow in streams down her once lovely face, no feast of love will ever be
            prepared for her. No forgiveness will ever welcome her to the best robe, the music hall
            or the dance. But frowns and jeers and burning contempt will ever drive her from the
            haunts of society, back to the houses of crime and of death; will remove all hope from
            her vision, cause her youthful sun to set before it is noon, and her to sink into the
            grave under the funeral dirge of her own lamentation, under clouds of gloom and dispair,
            that nothing but eternity's sun may disperse.</p>
          <p>With her voice of woe coming up from our cities and sounding in our ears for help and
            not knowing what is in reserve for our children, or our children's children, and anxious
            to imitate Him who gave His life for our race, as much for the thief upon the cross as
            for George Washington, as much for Mary Magdelene, once the companion of devils, as for
            Queen Victoria. Will not this Senate this day unanimously vote the passage of this bill
            that offers a moiety of aid for homes for poor, helpless, homeless, friendless, outcast
            women? And if heaven is peace and good will towards fallen humanity, as revalation
            declares and the good believe, will not such an act by such an enlightened body as this
            serve to brighten and increase its joys?</p>

          <p>The SPEAKER returned to the special order, viz: the consideration of Mr. Butterworth's
            bill [H. R. 340] for an act compelling Parents and Guardians to educate their children
            and wards - the question being on the second reading.</p>
          <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH of St. Joseph said: Mr. Speaker, I have no lengthy speech to make in
            arguing the merits of this bill, which I have had the honor (if any) of introducing. The
            idea of compulsory education in our State is rather a new one and has not been, until
            the introduction of this bill, discussed much in our papers though since the question
            has been brought before the Legislature for its consideration, there has been a general
            expression in the papers of all shades of political opinion endorsing the idea.</p>
          <p>Mr. Speaker, our school laws have been founded on the idea that parents and guardians
            would always avail themselves of the school privileges when provided. School houses,
            teachers, and everything is provided, yet with all these means at hand, statistics dhow,
            that many thousands in our State do not attend any school. To-day, more than three
            thousand five hundred children in this city, that ought, and by right should be, are not
            in school, nor are they receiving any sort of useful intellectual training. The
            important problem is, how are these children to be educated,to be brought into school ?
            How are they to be secured in their educational rights? These children, sir, think not
            for themselves. Those who control them do that for them. Many of them are truants and
            vagrants. If they are willing, they are helpless.</p>
          <p>Now, sir, I put the question, shall their parents and guardians be permitted to neglect
            the dearest interests of these thoughtless and helpless ones, - soon to become men and
            women - citizens. I say no. The State should interpose its authority in behalf of the
            helpless for their own interest. The State has a right to do it for its own sake,- the
            good of society. It must follow that the State must adopt the paternal idea and resort
            to the compulsory process where the parent neglects or refuses.</p>
          <p>Our Superintendent of Public Instruction, in his last report, just laid upon our
            tables, has earnestly recommended that there shall be some legislative enactment to
            compel parents and guardians, having the care of children of the proper age to give them
            at least something approaching a common school education.</p>
          <p>It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, that all who have read his report thoughtfully, ought to
            be convinced of the necessity of this bill becoming the law of our State. Look, sir, at
            the statistical tables there given. See the illiteracy of our State,think of the
            importance of an education and answer me - is the <pb n="471" xml:id="VAA8558-14-471"/>
            State doing right to permit its neglect? Every complicated interest, of the parent, of
            the child, of the State and society forbids it. The Superintendent's arguments, it seems
            to me are conclusive and irresistable, if we believe in the public school system at all,
            as I believe the catholic does not.</p>
          <p>Compulsory education is not a new thing outside of Indiana; and wherever it has been
            tried, it has been acceptable and popular, and heardly felt or known to be coercive in
            fact, - only in isolated instances where the parents from criminal greed of gain or from
            poverty and inappreciation of the value of educatian has the oppression of the law been
            felt.</p>
          <p>As unpleasant as the facts are, we are behind our sister States of the north in
            educational interests - with a common school fund I believe larger per capita, than any
            State in the Union, our people seem to lag behind in educational matters, and explain
            the cause as we may, we stand low in the roll of honor for our illiteracy. I will not
            take the time, Mr, Speaker, to examine the statistics, which are before us, but will
            state the humiliating fact that one hundred and twenty-seven thousand one hundred and
            twenty-four persons over ten years of age, or seven and one-half per cent of our entire
            population according to official statistics are illiterate - unable to read and write.
            Of these one hundred and three thousand three hundred and forty-one are adults with the
            responsible duties of citizenship and parentage upon them. I know some gentlemen are a
            little sensative on this subject, and are tired of hearing of the educators hobby of
            Indiana's illiteracy.</p>
          <p>Mr. Speaker, there are a great many unpleasant facts in life, and in our State affairs,
            that are not to be sneered at but met with, if possible, corrections. Do the members of
            this House know, sir, that thirty-nine thousand five hundred and nine of these are
            voters, more conspicuously tax voters than tax payers. Such are the facts, and
            intelligent men have to go to the polls with them, as is right under our form of
            government and divide their sovereignty with them. They count with the wisest. Is this
            wise? Is it prudent? Is it safe? Ought the State to allow such a map of ignorance -
            incapable of intelligent thought - to exist, to be preyed upon by demagogues that sway
            and control our elections and form opinions for it for selfish ends when it can be
            avoided?</p>
          <p>Mr. Speaker, it will be admitted that education is not the panacea for all evils of the
            day. The illiterate may, and often is, by observation, experience and good, hard common
            sense a wise man, while the education of books has only made a more competent thief - no
            doubt of it sir, at all; but still as a rule, the illiterate belongs to the dangerous
            class ; and the statistics from prisons and penal institutions everywhere prove
            this.</p>
          <p>But sir, I will not longer dwell on these common place ideas and commonly accepted
            arguments for the necessity of education of our people, as the ground word of our free
            institutions - all concede it. All acknowledge it. We boast in our fourth of July proud
            eloquence, of our universal sufferage and universal education, with the stubborn ugly
            facts of statistics staring us in the face, that one-tenth! yes sir, one-tenth of
            Indiana's entire voting population are unable to read.</p>
          <p>Now, Mr. Speaker, the intention of this bill is to make in fact, what we claim in the
            pride of a theory, universal education as of the highest interest of the State, and of
            the individual. Is it to the interest of the State to educate? You answer yes, its
            safety depends upon the intelligent actions of its citizens - the units of its component
            parts. Is it not to the highest interest of the child, the coming man or woman,that it
            be educated? You say yes, unquestionably yes as you must - then why not demand by
            legislative enactment as proposed in the bill under consideration that all shall be
            educated? Now, sir, what does the bill propose to do - nothing I think very arbitrary,
            but reasonable and just to the State and the child while in its helpless condition. It
            requires under moderate penalties for neglect that every person having control of
            children between the ages of eight and fourteen shall send them to school, some school
            either public or private, three months during the year if within one and a half miles of
            a school unless excused on account of mental or bodily infirmity, or that it is taught
            at home.</p>
          <p>It further proposes that in case of such poverty that parents cannot procure books and
            clothing, that the township trustee, when application is made, may furnish such needs as
            he may deem necessary as he now furnishes temporary relief to the poor. There is it
            seems to me, nothing very frightful in this, nothing very arbitrary in compelling an
            occasional unthinking, unfeeling and sometimes an avaricious and brutal parent, or more
            frequently a guardian to give the helpless children under them the time and opportunity
            to attend school.</p>
          <p>Mr. Speaker, this law will tyranize only where it ought to, to compel men to do right.
            The State steps in to prevent cruelty to animals and all good people say it is right to
            protect dumb brutes from brutal owners. I have seen instances, and you all have, where
            children, orphan children, are taken to raise like cattle and swine for the money and
            profit there is in them - they are driven with shameless cruelty to their work like
            cattle. This is done sir, in Indiana. I have known <pb n="472" xml:id="VAA8558-14-472"/>
            parents that apparently reward their children for the money there is in them - treated
            them as property rather than children. It is from these classes, sir, that comes much of
            our illiteracy now, and it is for these children that I now plead and ask the State to
            throw around them its protecting shield, and save their over-worked and tired muscles,
            favor the most intolerable tyrany. I shudder as I recall instances comeing under my own
            observation and of which I have often read, of the cruelty of guardians and often
            parents over whome they have despotic controll. The averice and greed of capital - and
            the needs of poverty, are the upper and neithe mill-stones that are grinding the poor
            helpless children to powder and bruising society in all our large towns and cities.</p>
          <p>Humane laws are being enacted now in some of the Eastern States, and I believe in
            England forbidding the employment of children until of certain age. This sort of
            legislative interference with the domestic affairs, with the relation of parent, and
            child may smack to some tyrany. In my estimation sir, its is a tyrany only in an
            abstract theory. Is it a tyrany to say that a parent, or more frequently a guardian,
            shall not neglect his child ? If so, it is a very healthful one, one that promotes every
            public, social, and individual interest. Whatever may be the natural capabilities of an
            individual, the odds are greatly against him, if he cannot read and keep his accounts. I
            care nothing for the opinion of men who will feel in their persons this sort of tyrany,
            if they ingnorantly or wilfully slight the opportunities to give some show of an
            education in letters to those under them, when the State provides the means. This bill
            under consideration does not compell attendence at any school, public or private.it
            simply compells those having children under their control to educate them in some
            manner, and the public schools are open to them free as air and water.</p>
          <p>Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, our public school system, is peculiary an American idea, and
            should never be abandoned by her legislators. It is compulsory in its very idea. The
            State levies its tax sometime burdensome, upon the willing and unwilling alike for
            school purposes. Its constant care is to man-tain and keep up its school fund for what
            is deemed almost a sacred purposes and unusually conceded of pramount importance. We are
            compelled, if we object, to pay this tax; and now I submit, sir, if it is right to so
            interfere with the domestic relations of men as to go into their pockets and take their
            hard earned money to educate all children should any be allowed to refuse the gift to
            his children from sheer ignorance, greed or obstinacy, and start them out inthe world to
            often become paupers, vagabonds and criminals ? The State, the welfare of society, and
            above all, the welfare of the child soon to be a man or woman, forbid it as this bill
            proposes, that it shall be left wholly to the option of a parent, whether he will or nor
            neglect his child in so important a matter. I say sir, let us either abandon compulsory
            contributions to school support, or require compulsory attendance to a certain
            reasonable degree. At least let us have an act that may be enforced in some of the
            conspicuous instances of barbarous and criminal neglect. Say some, the act will not be
            enforced. Perhaps not, but it will be a Legislative expression of the public will, which
            will have its influenceit will be a Legislative brand of odium on those persons who
            neglect their duties in this respect When our country was new and sparsely settled,
            schools could not be mantained, there were then excuses for illiteracy. But now it is no
            longer a necessity to be plead.</p>
          <p>Inability to read and write is now an evidence of slighted opportunities upon the part
            of parents for which there is no excuse or rational defence. A neglected education now
            with the opportunities afforded .in our public and private schools should be regarded,
            says our Superintendent of Public Instructions as "incipient crime against the State,
            and requires State remedies."</p>
          <p>As has before been said, our form of government above all others depends in its welfare
            upon the intelligence of its citizens. The problem of our population is complicated by
            emigration, arid the turning loose as it were an ignorant map of the late slaves no
            other country is situated in this respect as we are. While in none is the obligation
            more imparitive ; we are, in my judgement erring if we do riot adopt an active
            determination to secure general inteligence.</p>
          <p>Now, Mr. Speaker, If that common expression is true, that ignorance is the fruitful
            parent of vice, and statistics prove it. who can justly complain if the gentle hand of
            authority is laid on the candidates for crime, the prison, or probable pauperism. Says a
            writer, "the question is one of prisons or schools. I mantain that it is better for the
            State to force children to school that it may not force men to jail." Does it cost
            something to assist the very poor ? Yes it does. But it will be economy in the long run,
            schools are cheaper than prisons,prevention is preferable to cures. As before said sir,
            I am not expecting a mellennium by universal education - no sir, some of the worst and
            most dangerous criminals have been and are now technically educated, while many a man
            ignorant in letters is au honored citizen, But there is a remarkable co-incidence
            between the extension of educa- <pb n="473" xml:id="VAA8558-14-473"/>tion and the
            deminution of crime,it is everywhere observable.</p>
          <p>I suppose sir, the general propositions I have made here will be generously conceded,
            but still gentlemen will go slow in asserting the right of the State to invade what
            seems a private right of a parent. We love to think that we have individual rights, the
            State cannot touch; and when they are clearly and well denned we should guard them with
            a jealous hand. But I ask, is it a private right of a parent to over-work, maltreat and
            neglect while in its helpless condition his child's best interest ? He certainly has no
            private right to dwarf it, either physicall or mentally and bequeath to his country,
            instead of a good citizen, a poor one. No sir. These are not private rights, I am
            willing to concede, in my estimation the State has something more to do than provide
            ways and means, and look with indifference to results. The doctrine "of hands off," and
            the let alone policy is all well enough if we do right, but if not the higher interest
            must be consulted.</p>
          <p>Now Mr. Speaker, I have said about all I desire to say now, and will conclude my speech
            on this question by stating, that I think that an act of this kind is now needed. It is
            in accord with the progressive spirit of the age. It is, where ever tried, meeting with
            popular approval and with good results. In Europe, especially in Prussia it is the
            fundamental idea; and I venture the assertion, that all the complaints of the old
            country among our foreign population in this, no one ever heard a germ an complain of
            the compulsory feature of their school system. Their public sense of its usefulness is
            now so strong, that they hardly know there is such a thing as coersion, and so in my
            judgement will it be with us if adopted here as I hope it soon will be gentlemen don't
            be afraid of the good hard common sense of the people. Remember you are saving the
            thoughtless avericious or cruel parent from a probable humilliation at his offsprings
            degradation by his neglect, you are protecting a child often bereft of parents, from
            over-work, by a hard hearted and greedy master ; you are giving the child the best
            possible armament for its defence in future life, by educating it, and giving it an
            equal start in the world in the race of life.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. Mr. Speaker, I do not propose to detain the House with a speech. I have
            heard the ignorance of the people of Indiana held up and bemoaned in this House about as
            long as I want to hear it; and if gentlemen will agree to shut their mouths on this
            subject I will vote for this bill. I think it has come to a pretty pass, when we can
            have nothing better to harp upon here than the ignorance of the people ; and I think so,
            because it hits me. My mother was too poor to send me to school, and I developed without
            much education. - While I am in favor of popular education I am tired of being told that
            we as a people are more ignorant and stupid in the State of Indiana than in any other
            State of the Union, when such is not the fact. Therefore being in favor of schools, as I
            said before, if gentlemen will quit slandering the people of the State I will vote for
            this bill. [Laughter.]</p>
          <p>Mr. HELLER proposed to amend in section one line three, by striking out"between the
            ages of eight and fourteen," and inserting "ten and seventeen" in lieu.</p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. BAKER, the amendment was laid on the table.</p>
          <p>Mr. McKINNEY proposed to strike out and insert a provision for the six weeks attendance
            during the fall term of the common schools in their respective districts, commencing on
            or after the first Monday in September, etc.</p>
          <p>Mr. KIMBALL. Some of the terms begin in October.</p>
          <p>The amendment was adopted.</p>
          <p>Mr. BAXTER proposed to amend section four, by inserting between the words "trustee" and
            "shall" these words: "if he be satisfied that the application is reasonable and just,
            having reference to applications" by the poor for provisions, clothing and books.</p>
          <p>Mr. KIMBALL. The bill has that clause.</p>
          <p>Mr. LENFESTY moved to reconsider the vote on the adoption of the amendment of Mr.
            McKenney. He said it was adopted under a misunderstanding.-The amend-compels the parent
            or guardian to commence the sending of his child to school with the fall term, which
            might be sometimes very inconvenient. It makes the requisition much stronger than it
            would be if the amendment were left out.</p>
          <p>Mr. KIMBALL. This commencement of the compulsory term is at a time which will favor
            those who are farmers. The motion to reconsider was agreed to, and the question recurred
            on the amendment.</p>
          <p>Mr. WALKER proposed to strike out from the amendment, "commencing on the first Monday
            of September 1873."</p>
          <p>Mr. CLARK understood that to be the date when the proposed law goes into effect.</p>
          <p>Mr. COWGILL. That is evidently the meaning. I do not understand that the child is
            required ai that time to commence going to school.Mr. BRETT moved to amend the amendment
            by striking out the words, "commencing," and "after."</p>
          <pb n="474" xml:id="VAA8558-14-474"/>
          <p>It was adopted by a unnimous consent ; and then the amendment as amended was
            adopted.</p>
          <p>Mr. BAKER purposed to amend section three in line four, by striking out "not less than
            five nor more than ten dollars for the first offense, nor less than ten nor more than
            twenty dollars for any subsequent ofiense," and inserting "one or more than twenty" in
            lieu.</p>
          <p>Mr. BUTTS. I hope the bill will not be amended at all. It is a copy of the Michigan
            law, I therefore move to lay the amendment on the table.</p>
          <p>The motion was rejected.</p>
          <p>Mr. KIMBALL. It seems to me that the bill ought to remain just as it is.</p>
          <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
          <p>Mr. MILLER proposed an amendment to the first section after "Home," line thirteen,
            insert "or night school."In some of our cities we have what is called night schools,
            that teach all the branches taught in the day schools : and it seems to me that the
            children attending a night school might be excluded from this provision.</p>
          <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH. It seems to me that the amendment is unnecessary; and if no one wishes
            to make a speech on it I will move to lay it on the table!</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. But few children attend the night schools, while many grown up people
            attend them.</p>
          <p>The amendment was laid on the table.</p>
          <p>Mr. BAXTER, proposed to amend section two by striking out and inserting: "not less than
            one dollar or more than five for the first offense and not less than five or more than
            ten for any subsequent offense." I think these would be equally as affective as heavier
            fines.</p>
          <p>Mr. KIMBALL. I am astonished at my friend from Wayne, he and I voted for the bill that
            inflicted fines upon other persons; as if a man is found drunk he would fine and
            imprison him. But now the object is to send the children to school; and if they are not
            sent, under his amendment the fine will not be inflicted, or it will be
            insufficient.</p>
          <p>Mr. BAXTER. The two cases, I would say to the gentleman from Marion, are different. The
            imprisonment is inflicted if the individual fails to testify. The great difficulty about
            enforcing the law is to get the testimony. I want this law, and I hope the House will
            adopt the amendment.</p>
          <p>Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. This law will not have so much effect upon those classes of children
            which are kept from school as upon those who are idle; and I feel that it must be
            according to the observation of every gentleman that this is a crying evil greater than
            the other.</p>
          <p>Mr. KIMBALL. In larger cities especially there is a large class of people who, instead
            of sending their children to school, send them around as beggars; but this fine will
            compel them to send their children to school. This unwillingness to testify, and the
            unwillingness to send to school stand up-the same footing.</p>
          <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. It seems to me if the amendment should prevail it would rob the bill of
            its efficiency. To impose a fine from one to five dollars is not to inforce the law at
            all. It seems to me that the children of poor people ought to be educated as well as the
            children of the rich. Every law should be connected with a penalty sufficient to enforce
            it. There is no good sense in enacting a law, and then robbing it of all its executive
            force. If this bill is not to apply to the children of poor parents who are keeping them
            at home to work, then the proper remedy is not what the gentlemen proposes, because that
            would be but a provision exempting the children of parents under such circumstances.</p>
          <p>Mr. HATCH. I am in favor of the amendment for the fines would generally fall on the
            poor. You know, sir, that poor men generally have the most children. [Laughter.]</p>
          <p>Mr. COWGILL. In many instances parties have good reason for not sending their children
            to school: and if these reasons are not good, then the fine of five dollars with the
            attendant cost would be a pretty heavy penalty and answer every purpose.</p>
          <p>Mr. RUMSEY. I am glad to see the friendliness that is manifested toward this bill. It
            proposes a revolution in education; and I think all its provisions should be made
            reasonable. If we reduce this penalty too low the law will be a dead letter. Perhaps
            forty per cent. of the children of the State, are the children of parents who do not
            clothe them in a manner fitting for them to attend the schools; hence the absurdity of
            passing a law inflcting penalties on such persons. My argument in favor of compulsory
            education is this: A great many scholars round the towns and cities are playing truant;
            and in some places they are planning for a more stringent supervision of them. This bill
            would help such cases. Another reason for supporting this bill is this: We have voted
            for a special tax for schools: and why ? because rich men having no children to educate
            would not submit to such a general tax. While at the same time these men, in many
            regions, are willing to increase this tax, if you will compel these children to go to
            school. Leaving all moral questions out of view this bill makes the law to tax for
            education more feasible. I hope the bill will pass in a mild form: for the very word
            compulsion is a hard word.</p>
          <p>Mr, THOMPSON of Elkhart. Poor men <pb n="475" xml:id="VAA8558-14-475"/>generally send
            their children to school, but we have another class of children who have lost their
            parents, and some of them go to the poor house, and others of them are bound out; and if
            you compel these men - who get their children for the benefit of their labor to educate
            them, I would be in favor of increasing rather than deminishing the penalty. The labor
            of a boy ten or twelve years of age for three months is worth more than five dollars:
            and if you adopt the amendment which the gentleman from Wayne proposes it would not be
            compulsory at all.</p>
          <p>Mr. MILLER. The penalty in the bill is light enough as it is. The only way you can
            compel parents or guardians to send to the schools is to compel them by penalties.
            Gentlemen should remember that you have to wait till the end of the year before you can
            fine these delinquents ; and that there is but one punishment - one penalty in the year:
            and the effect of the amendment would be a fine of one dollar a year. As the gentleman
            from Tippecanoe might well say: the boy that would rather hunt than go to school might
            pay the fine with rabit-skins or red-fox scalps.</p>
          <p>Mr. Baxter's amendment was rejected.</p>
          <p>Mr. BLOCHER proposed to amend that clause in the fourth section of the bill which
            authorizes the Trustee to furnish clothing and books, so that the trustee be required to
            furnish such persons also at least one meal of victuals a day, if is only mush and
            milk.</p>
          <p>It was rejected.</p>
          <p>Mr. FULLER proposed to amend section four, by inserting, after words "town trustees,"
            these words : "or school boards of incorporated towns or cities." - Section four compels
            the township trustee to make these provisions for the poor of the cities and towns. I
            think cities and towns ought to care for their own poor ; and that their school boards
            ought to make their provisions. Therefore I offer this amendment.</p>
          <p>Mr. BUTTS. The town trustees are the only persons having the means to purchase their
            clothes and books.</p>
          <p>Mr. TULLEY. Is it not right to compel the peopl outside to pay these expenses. I
            Relieve the people of the towns and cities ought to pay the charges of their own poor -
            that they are just as able to care for their own poor as the people outside.</p>
          <p>Mr. SATTERWHITE. Do not the people of the cities and towns pay the township tax - just
            as the people do outside?</p>
          <p>Mr. KIMBALL. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to amend the second section by adding these words: "Justices of
            the Peace shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction in the trial of all
            prosecutions under this act, subject to appeal to the Circuit and Common Pleas Courts."
            He said: It seems to me that such an amendment as this ought to prevail; because,
            without such an amendment, it is doubtful whether any Court at all would have
            jurisdiction to try prosecutions under this act. But, even if it should be held that all
            the Courts have competent jurisdiction to try prosecutions under this act, then also it
            would seem to me that these prosecutions ought to be heard before a Justice of the
            Peace, because the cost would be less. Before the Circuit or Common Pleas the cost,
            would be out of proportion to the amount involved.</p>
          <p>The amendment was adopted: and the question recurred on the engrossment.</p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. BUTTERWORTH it was ordered that the bill be considered as
            engrossed.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. There are several discrepancies in the bill; amongst them is the amendment
            which has just been adopted. In the third section of the bill it is declared that
            prosecution under this third section may be withheld before any Court having competant
            jurisdiction.</p>
          <p>Mr. RENO. I have my objections to this bill. Our people are not very well supplied with
            competant teachers; at least I know that is the case in my county: and many of them are
            not fit to govern a school according to the provisions of law: and according to the
            provisions of this bill parents have to send to the school whether they approve the
            teacher or not. This is an innovation - an invasion upon the rights of the family. And
            there is another thing in the way: we have a great many colored children scattered
            throughout the State; and you can't legislate to suppress the prejudice of all that is
            against them, though it may be wrong. And one of the consequences of the passage of this
            bill will be that the people will be required to send their chilldren to school with the
            colored children ; and it will be required as an attempt to force this social equality
            with them. I have known cases where schools have been broken up by the presence of
            colored children. Sir, such a law as this bill proposes would be an attempt to break
            down this prejudice which is an absurdity. Therefore 1 shall vote against the bill: I am
            in favor of education, but not in favor of this compulsory business. I believe the
            people can take care of themselves in this matter; better than we can care for them.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRETT. I wish to give some of my reasons for not supporting this bill. I look upon
            it as an invasion of the spirit of our free institutions. Our people should do right
            from, choice - from a preference of motives - not from compulsion. Besides this I am
            opposed <pb n="476" xml:id="VAA8558-14-476"/>to enacting compulsory laws when it is
            unnecessary to do so: and no argument has yet convinced me of the wisdom of taking the
            matter of the education of children out of the hands of their natural protectors - their
            parents. I know of no case of any person refusing to send to the schools. I believe the
            sentiment is universal with the people of the State, that they are decidedly in favor of
            educating their children : and I look upon this bill as a reflection upon them. I don't
            see the necessity in our State of running wildly after everything that is done
            elsewhere. While our institutions are working well enough, I am content to let well
            enough alone. Suppose, sir, that a designing, immoral school teacher should attempt to
            corrupt the females of his school, and suppose the authorities to sustain such a teacher
            under this bill they could compel you to send your child to him, no matter what your own
            opinion of him may be. Then again ; all prudential considerations concerning the child -
            its health, the time in which it should be educated, etc., are proposed by this bill to
            be transferred from its natural protectors to the hands of those who are supposed to be
            more interested in them. Then I see that this bill invites the drones and idlers to come
            in, and proposes that our people shall clothe and educate their children! I adopt the
            principle that property should educate children of the State ; but I can't for the life
            of me see the wisdom of running to this extreme. These fines and penalties smack too
            much of the tyrany of the earlier days in the old world. We are a free people, and
            should do right from higher motives. We should have the choice of motives. Therefore I
            shall feel compelled to vote against this bill. I think we would pay our fellow citizens
            a much higher compliment by leaving the statutes as they are, than by enacting this.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOODARD. Mr. Speaker, I shall vote against this bill. I believe we have a pretty
            thorough system of education. I believe also that the individual should be punished for
            his crimes committed - not for his sins of omission. Under our law, sir, we have no
            right to compel people to send their children to school; but under this bill there would
            be compulsion; and no discriminations in favor of worthey parties. The plan of the great
            salvation, as I understand it, is this: the Deity throws every facility - every just
            opportunity - into the power of individuals; and they rest upon their own responsibility
            as to negligence. There is no man on this floor who would like to be compelled to do
            what an affirmative vote on this bill would require the people to do. This bill is
            saying to the people: you shall do this thing, no matter what may come up in your way ;
            you shall be compelled by law to take your children and send them to school for so long
            a term every year against every controvening necessity!I say to the friends of education
            in the State, that they would be doing their cause a great injury by such a complication
            of our school system. No people can establish a perfect school system at once. And
            because other States have enacted laws similer to that which this bill proposes it in no
            good reason that we should blindly follow their example. I say; let them try their own
            experiments, and we will profit by them ; and I will say only this further If gentlemen
            would serve the cause of education let them vote down this bill.</p>
          <p>Mr. KIMBALL. It seems that on mature consideration it would strike the mind of every
            man that this bill is correct in principle. It is right for the State to compel the
            citizen to do right. My friend from Daviess [Mr. Brett,] advocated the argument, that
            every man should be left to chow for himself to do right; but it seems to me that it is
            necessary to pass laws compeling them to do right - that it is even necessary and wise
            to pass laws restraining men from doing what it might be perfectly right for them to do
            under certain circumstances. Now sir, I could not say anything here that would prevent
            my friend from Jefferson [Mr. Branham,] from voting for this bill, I make no allusion to
            the ignorance of our people, - I believe they are - as other people; but I am prepared
            to say and do anything in my power to compel all people to educate their children. But
            it should not be forgotten that this bill provides that children may be educated at
            their homes: and it is only when from an avaricious disposition from the greed of gain
            by their labor - the children are kept at home,then only is it that this bill proposes,
            (and I think rightfully,) that they should be compelled to school. - The Saviour of the
            world has enjoined the duty of culture in the family: and whenever this system has been
            adopted by the State good has resulted from it and the cause of Liberty has been
            advocated. The freedom of man has kept pace with the intelligence of the people all over
            the world.</p>
          <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. There is a provision in the first section of this bill by which the child
            is excused who is too much afflicted for study during the required period, that induces
            me to vote for it: and it seems to me that this does away practically with the
            objections that have been brought forward by the gentleman from Owen [Mr. Reno,] and the
            gentleman from Daviess [Mr. Brett.] The objections are to this effect: that the hill
            compels parents and guardians to send their children to schools where the teachers may
            not be acceptable. The gentlemen from Daviess says it compels parents to send to <pb
              n="477" xml:id="VAA8558-14-477"/> school where the teachers are immoral. I do not so
            understand the bill I understand that the bill provides that the children may be excused
            from the schools if they are educated at home. - </p>
          <p>It seems to me sir, that the practical effect of this bill is not misunderstood. It is
            not a bill compelling parents and guardians to send to school; but it is a bill
            compelling education. If it were a bill compelling parents and guardians to lend to
            school, then I think the objection would be good. The gentleman says also, that it
            compels parents to send their children to mingle at school with colored children; but I
            do not so understand the bill. I understand that under this bill parents will have
            precisely the same right to keep their children at home that they have now; but parents
            shall not keep their children in idleness - in negligence of education. Then in Owen
            County, the people would still have the privilege of keeping their children at home. The
            only difference it would make is this: that we shall no longer (as now) have the right
            to keep our children at home in idleness and ignorance of education. - It seems to me
            sir, that the bill is not objectionable on this ground. - But it is objected that this
            bill is opposed to the republican spirit which underlies our government. I understand
            that this same objection was raised at the first against the principle of taxation for
            schools in this country. They said it was opposed to the spirit of free government. But
            that doctrine has been overturned by the general acknowledgment of the right to tax for
            the public good; and by the consession of the fact that ignorance leads to crime ; and
            that argument supports this bill for compulsory education. The gentleman from Jefferson
            [Mr. Branham,] will pardon me if I allude to a few facts and give a few figures in this
            connection. There are fifteen thousand six hundred and fifteen illiterate children in
            this State between the ages of twelve and twenty-one.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRETT interposing. How many of them are children of colored parents?</p>
          <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. I know not how that is: but I submit, in answer to that, that we are just
            as much interested in the education of the colored as the white children.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRETT. But the want of education in colored children has not been so much their own
            fault.</p>
          <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. That is true. [Mr. B. proceeded to read figures from the late Report of
            the Superintendent of Public Instructions, embracing also brief extracts from Kent,
            Blackstone. Reed and Reeves, of Conneticut.]</p>
          <p>Mr. BRETT. That is where they make wooden nutmegs. </p>
          <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. Whether they make wooden nutmegs or not, it is certain that they have a
            much greater proportion of reading and writing people than we; and I admire the fact
            that the number of their illiterates is so small, notwithstanding the nutmegs. - But I
            am not in a speechonly for the purpose of explaining my vote.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM would recommit the bill with instructions to amend so as to compel parents
            and guardians to teach their children some useful employment. He said: If we are going
            to take the management of this thing we ought to be careful to make the harness
            useful.</p>
          <p>Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Mr. Speaker, I want to say merely that this bill naturally follows
            the laws of taxation for educational purposes. In many of the rural districts I have
            found sometimes no school houses, and more frequently school houses not half built, or
            built with many inconveniences, and the children running at large. We are willing to be
            taxed for schools and school houses; but when that is done we are not willing to see the
            children restrained from the schools or running idly abroad. I insist, sir, that this
            bill results naturally, as flowing from the principle of taxation for school purposes;
            that the children should be required to attend the schools in better school houses, and
            that the pay of the teachers should be raised.</p>
          <p>Mr. MILLER. I am friendly toward this bill. I do not want to see it lost. But we want a
            bill that will do what this proposes to do; that will compel the people to give their
            children an education. In the first section it is provided that any child may be excused
            from the schools "if it be shown to the satisfaction of such Board or Trustee that the
            bodily and mental condition of such child has been such as to prevent its attendance at
            school or that such child has been too much afflicted to study for the period required,
            or that such child is taught at home such branches as are usually taught in primary
            schools, or that such child has already acquired the ordinary branches of learning
            taught in the public schools; provided that in case no public school is taught for three
            months during the year within one and a half miles by the nearest traveled route of the
            residence of said parent or guardian, then they shall not be liable to tie provisions of
            this act."</p>
          <p>These prosecutions, I suppose are to be brought before a justice of the peace. But
            then, is there always a justice of the peace living in the township? Are the parties too
            poor to be prosecuted ? What kind of evi dence will be necessary to make a successful
            defence? All they have got to do is to show that the child has been taught at home in
            the ordinary branches of learning taught in the public school, The question as to how
            much <pb n="478" xml:id="VAA8558-14-478"/> the child has been sometime taught is not
            material. All they have got to do is to bring in some one about the house and prove that
            the child has been taught in spelling, reading and arithmetic. No question about much or
            little teaching. I undertake to say that there is a loop-hole here by which every parent
            or guardian in the State of Indiana can keep out of the way of the penalty.</p>
          <p>I think, sir, that here is a just objection to the bill. I think that this provision
            should require that the child shall be taught to some definite extent - and that extent
            apportioned to the age of the child. It should be that the child of eight years shall
            have made a certain progress in study; that the child of twelve years shall have made
            greater proficiency; and that there should be something by which this proficiency could
            be determined - could be measured. I think the bill requires amendment here.</p>
          <p>Then there is another objection as to the protection for punishment under this proposed
            law. I suppose that none but the township Trustee or the Board of Education have the
            right to prosecute: and these are to prosecute upon information of others, - for they
            cannot be required to make affidavit about that which they know nothing at all. And I
            undertake to say that to require men who may bo so unfortunate as to be elected to serve
            as township trustees or members of a board of education to go into court and institute
            criminal prosecutions against their neighbors under such a kind of vague information,
            must be very singular legislation. And there are other objections on account of which I
            think the bill ought not to pass in its present shape.</p>
          <p>Mr. HATCH was satisfied that the bill would work hardships in some localities and would
            vote against it.</p>
          <p>Mr. BUTTERWORTH demanded the previous question; - but</p>
          <p>On motion of Mr. BLOCHER the House took a recess till two o'clock p. m.</p>
          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
            <p>The SPEAKER resumed the consideration of the special order - Mr. Butterworth's
              Compulsory education bill [H. R. 340]the question being on the engrossment.</p>
            <p>Mr. HELLER. Mr. Speaker, this morning I thought perhaps I might vote for this bill,
              but during the discussion I have considered whether I should not vote against it. It
              involves a question of more importance than one might see at once: simply a question
              whether I shall control my own household, or whether I shall consent to give that
              control to the State or some one else. This is a serious question: one that conies
              right home to the heart of every man.</p>
            <p>It seems to me that every father of a family should have the right to say when his
              children shall be educated. I have a family sir, and when you are legislating to
              authorize men to come into my family to see whether I am negligent about the education
              of my children, you are placing in the statute book a law which is contrary to the
              institutions of freedom the world over. It might be an absolute abuse of a child to
              compel him to march daily, one and a half miles to school during such weather as we
              have had this winter : and yet gentlemen are proposing to pass a law that might compel
              me to do so. I have no doubt that the friends of the bill mean well. I have nothing to
              say against its authors and supporters. But the spirit of the bill is wrong - it is
              wrong in principle. It is another clutch of the hand at the throat of freedom - to rob
              us of our rights, which we inherited from our fathers who fought and bled for the
              liberties of our country. The more I think on these things the more I feel impressed
              with objections to the bill: and while at the first I thought it would pass. I think
              now that it should not. I cannot forget that a large per cent of our people are
              emigrants from the old country. Then, the larger number of districts are sparsely
              settled - unlike the situation in old Connecticut and elsewhere. If the school house
              were at the door of every man it would remove this chief difficulty.</p>
            <p>I have offered an amendment which was not entertained, to make the age of compulsory
              attendance from ten to seventeen years, where the bill says now from eight to
              fourteen: and I still think the bill is wrong there. We are here to act for the
              benefit of the people, and we ought not to outrage common sense. We should not act
              hastily. There is hasty legislation enough without this. But still, if there is a man
              on this floor who can change my mind as to the course of the argument which has
              directed me so far in this debate I would be glad for him to do so. It is right for a
              man to provide for his own family ; and it is his duty to; but you can't pass a law
              compelling him to do it. Yon cannot always compel by law that which common humanity
              requires without regard to law. So when you seek to place a law on the statute book to
              compel me to take my children and send them to a certain school for a certain time you
              are attempting to steal away from me what is my inalienable right. Only the other day
              you called upon the people to provide for the support of County Superintendents of the
              schools; but the time is coming, sir, when you must shorten the tail of your coat, and
              keep it within the bounds of reason.</p>
            <p>I do not know, that this question has any connection whatever with the churches.
              Fortunately or unfortunately for me. I be- <pb n="479" xml:id="VAA8558-14-479"/> long
              to no church; but I am admonished by them all. From one I learn devotion to the
              church: from another I learn to cut my coat according to my cloth: from another I
              learn to pray; and so I presume that no one like me would think to connect this
              question with reIigion. I think there is nothing of the kind in it.</p>
            <p>The author of this bill has suggested that it is time to stop this discussion. I know
              gentlemen sometimes get tired of a dry debate; but the more debate the better the
              consideration: and we certainly have time to consider every matter here with all
              needful deliberation. Better to leave many things undone than to do anything wrong.
              Better not pass a measure than to pass it without due consideration. Doubtless I have
              myself cast some votes here unwisely; but in most of these cases I can justly plead
              that it was because I was forced to vote before I could be well ready.</p>
            <p>I think I have now said enough to be understood as to my position on this question;
              it is not that I would do or say anything against the cause of education, but that I
              think, by opposing this bill, I shall be doing what will be ultimately for the benefit
              of the people. If I vote wrong on this question, all I can do is to pray that I may be
              forgiven.</p>
            <p>Mr. WALKER. I have counselled with some of the friends of the bill, and with others
              who will vote against it unless it is changed; and I believe that if we strike out the
              third section it will strengthen it. The objectionable principle is that which would
              compel the trustee or other officer to make oath and prosecute the offender under
              criminal liability. And, as I have the consent of the leading friends of the bill I
              ask the unanimous consent of the House that that provision be now stricken ont.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOD objected.</p>
            <p>Mr. WALKER. Then I will move to recommit the bill with instructions to strike out
              section three.</p>
            <p>Mr. DIAL moved to amend the instructions so as to require the Committee to amend the
              bill by inserting a clause requiring all fines and penalties collected under this act
              to be equally divided between the informer and the school fund.</p>
            <p>On the motion of Mr. BUTTERWORTH Mr. Dial's motion was laid on the table; and then,
              (Mr. Walker's motion having been adopted,) the bill was referred again to the
                <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName>.</p>

          <p> When Mr. O'BRIEN in behalf of the<orgName>Committee on Rights and Privileges</orgName>
            returned Mr. Harveys bill [S. 241] declaring all agreements to pay attorney's fees when
            contained in any written evidence of in-deptedness as an addition thereto, on a
            contingency, usurious, illegal and void, with a recommendation that it be indefinitely
            pos-poned.</p>
          <p>Mr. HARVEY said, the bill was to abolish a costom growing into use which was contrary
            to the spirit of our laws and founded on a false assumption.</p>
          <p>Our courts in theory and practice were open and free to all. There was no more reason
            why a defaulting debtor should pay an attorney fee for the benefit of his creditor in
            case of suit, than that he should be made to pay five per cent each day the note passed
            overdue, it was simply usury in a very oppressive form leaving him liable for a very
            undeterminate amount.</p>
          <p>Under the usage now a man can recover pay for collecting his own debts due him. It is
            reported that a costom of this kind was so abused that Life and Liberty was put up as
            forfeit on non payment if a note or bond but a very noted decission exposed the fallacy
            of the doctrine so clearly that courts since that have been loth to favor such usurious
            practices. It is charged that lawyers favor the costom of incorporating in notes a
            provision for paying atttorneys fees.</p>
          <p>So far I have observed that lawyers get their pay anyhow and would much prefer being
            paid by the party for whom they do the service rather than be compelled to collect it
            from an unwilling debtor.</p>
          <p>The whole costom is liable to great abuses and should be abolished before it
            accomplishes any further mischief.</p>
          <p>Mr. BROWN favored the passage of the bill. He said he was opposed to the condition
            requiring the borrower to pay the expenses of the lender's litigation.</p>
          <p>M. O'BRIEN said he favored the adoption the report, not becanse he was especially
            opposed to this bill, but because he was opposeed to all this legislation to prevent men
            from making such contracts as they please. The only way to prevent men from making
            improper or oppressive con tracts is to educate them up to the point of knowing better.
            It cannot be done by legislation and it is not a proper subject for legislation.</p>
          <p>Mr. STEELE differed with the gentleman. He thought it was right and the duty of the
            Legislature to interfere with men when they were found making contracts which were
            unjust and oppressive to themselves or when other men toook advantage of their
            necessities to extort such contracts.</p>

            <head rend="center">THE STATE UNIVERSITY.</head>
            <p>The bill [H. R. 56,] to authorize the appropriation of $15,000 annually out of the
              State Treasury for the use of Indiana University, located at Bloomington, in addition
              to that already allowed, the special order for 10:30 o'clock was now taken up.</p>

            <p>Pending the roll-call - </p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: I moved to amend
              this bill the other day so that the appropriation to the state University, with the
              interest from the endowment fund, would amount to about twenty-six thousand six
              hundred dollars annually. That I think was all the friends of the Institution ought to
              ask knowing the depleted condition of our Treasury. Because of this act on my part I
              was thought by some to be unfriendly to the university. With the last amendment I
              proposed the Institution would have about twenty-six thousand six hundred dollars - a
              sum largely in advance of the amount ever received by this Institution in any one
              year. Still the friends of this Institution urged us to increase the annual fund to
              thirty-one thousand dollars. If our Treasury was plethoric I think it would be proper
              to make that appropriation, while the amount I proposed would not cripple the
              Institution because it would be largely in advance if any sum ever received by it
              heretofore. We will be under the necessity of borrowing a large amount of money,
              oweing to the large appropriations made by this Legislature but I don't want to go
              upon the record as voting in a manner that will tend to detract from the prosperity of
              the State University.When the roll call was completed - </p>

            </head>
            <p>The bill [H. R. 137] to amend section one hundred and three of the Practice act in
              reference to the order of proceedings in cases on trial before a Court or jury was
              read the third time. [The amendment provides that in criminal cases the Prosecuting
              Attorney shall have the opening and close, but he must disclose, in his opening
              arguments, all the points upon which he relies; and if, in his close he presents any
              new point or fact the defendant or his council shall have the right to reply, which
              shall be the last argument in the case. The case may be submitted without argument by
              consent of the parties. If the Prosecuting Attorney declines to make the opening
              argument the defendant or his counsel may present his case and the State shall have no
              right to reply].</p>
            <p>Pending Mr. Friedly's (of Lawrence) motion that the bill be indefinitely postponed - </p>
            <p>Mr. BOONE said: If it is right that the plaintiff should have the open and close in
              criminal cases, I never could see the reason why it is not equally right in criminal
              cases where the State has to make put a case beyond a reasonable doubt. My judgment is
              that many a criminal who is guilty and who has been proven guilty by the evidence and
              so shown by the instructions of the Court has been acquitted through the irresistable
              eloquence of gentlemen who make the defense of criminals a business. I am opposed to
              the indefinite postponment of this bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. GLESSNER. I am opposed to the passage of this bill and think it ought to be
              indefinitely postponed. The Senator from Boone (Mr. Boone) says he can't see why it is
              that the same rule should not apply in criminal that applies to civil cases. In the
              first place there is no analogy between crimnal and civil cases, and the same rule
              can't apply in the trial of criminal as of civil cases. In civil cases 'tis generally
              a mere question of dollars and cents, and the plaintiff must make out a case by his
              evidence, and the defendant has the right to confront him with witnesses to testify in
              the case and to rebut the evidence of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has the right to
              close the case, aud when you come to the comparative importance of the matter it is a
              matter of indifference whether the verdict is right or wrong where the question is as
              to mere dollars and cents. But when you come to a criminal case the rule is different.
              The defendant is arranged before the bar of the court. The State arrays its testimony,
              makes out its case, and the mouth of the defendant is closed only by his counsel can
              he speak. The jury is empanelled to try his case with perjudices in their bosoms
              against the commission of crime and against the defendant before the court.</p>
            <p>He said that criminal law is based upon<pb n="482" xml:id="VAA8558-14-482"/> the
              principal that it is better for ninety-nine criminals to go unwhipped of justice than
              one innocent man should be convicted. This rule has obtained in the State of Indiana
              for many years and as I understand it is satisfactory and has been recognized as the
              proper rule, and while the mouth of the defendant is closed I think it should obtain.
              If the law should be changed I would be in favor of allowing the defendant to testity;
              and then the rule would be fair to allow the State to close the case. In that way I
              believe convictions would be brought about where they are not now. That is the rule in
              many States and it works properly and justly, and the public are satisfied with
              it.</p>
            <p>This proposes not even to permit the defendant to close the argument in the case. The
              State has the beginning with witnesses and has the closing with witnesses, then she
              comes back and rebuts under this bill and finally has the last argument before the
              jury. 'Tis too radical an innovation upon the present rule. Nobody is asking for it,
              unless perhaps we may find a man who has become dispeptic on account of long practice
              at the bar and who has lost sympathy for mercy in a great measure.</p>
            <p>Mr. HARNEY. In this matter the question is between the people of the State on one
              side, and on the other side the man they are trying for an offense against the law.
              The people should have just as much justice on their side as the person arrigned for
              trial. Since this law has been in effect - twenty years or more - it never has had a
              majority of the people in its favor. A majority of four-fifths, I believe, are opposed
              to the present law. I am well satisfied that people desiring men guilty should be
              punished are reproaching judges and jury because crime is on the increase, and are
              demanding that the present law should be changed.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. I favor the passage of this bill, not because I desire to favor
              convictions but because I desire to do that which judgment and consciences teaches me
              is right. The State of Indiana is the only State in the American Union which has the
              anomaly that allows the defendant to close a case. It is an innovation upon common law
              unwarranted by any judicial or legislative precedent, inconsistent with reason and
              repugnant to common sense.</p>
            <p>To say that a party who has placed upon his shoulders the burden of the issue ought
              to be allowed to open and close the case would not only be contrary to reason but in
              violation of all history; and in 1853, I believe it was, when this changed was worked
              in the criminal practice it was done by some shrewd lawyers for their personal
              success; and from that day to this there has grown up in Indiana an opinion that the
              rights of the public in criminal courts are insecure. I desire that we shall perfect
              such legislation as shall tend to convince the public that their rights are secure and
              not insecure.</p>
            <p>Mercy in the trial of criminal cases should be tempered with justice. It is legal
              justice which is sought to be found in the investigation of criminal cases and not
              that fancied mercy that takes possession of a certain class of men. The law is founded
              upon a rule that proposes to provide protection for the peace, happiness and security
              of society, the enforcement of public order, the maintenance of the public peace, the
              protection of life and property, and the security of the person demands that the
              administration of criminal justice should be such as would insure the public
              safety.</p>
            <p>It seems to me that this bill is very carefully guarded so that no injustice may be
              done a party accused of crime; and that if the practice is changed it will work no
              disadvantage to an innocent man.</p>
            <p>Mr. GREGG. There is two or three reasons why I shall vote for the postponement of the
              bill. It is true that in several States of this Union the prosecuting Attorney opens
              and closes, and if we would change the criminal code of Indiana and make it the same
              as that of Ohio, I might vote for such a measure. In Ohio, where the State has the
              opening and closing the jury finds the fact of guilt only, and the judge fixes the
              punishment. In some States the defendent is permitted to testify. Then, if we pass
              this bill, in the prosecution of a case before a Justice of the Peace the State will
              have the opening and closing of the case, and there the jury, the prosecutor, and the
              court trying the case - all their fees depend upon conviction. In the Circuit Courts,
              where we have a Judge to instruct the jury, I apprehend it is not very material
              whether the State or the defense closes the case because under the instructions of the
              Court justice will be apt to be done. For these reasons I am not prepared to vote to
              change the law.</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence. I am. very well satisfied, after hearing gentlemen who
              advocate this change in our law, the interests of the people at large do not demand
              the change. It has been very well said that the experience of the people with the law
              we have on the statute books is that the law is wise, and I believe the people as a
              general thing are satisfied with it.</p>
            <p>It seems to me that the arguments of the friends of this bill proceeds upon two great
              errors, as they seem to believe that courts are simply organized to convict. They seem
              to believe it to be the duty of the State to so frame their laws that whenever a man
              is arraigned before a court charged with the commission of a crime, that conviction
              will be absolutel <pb n="483" xml:id="VAA8558-14-483"/> certain. I do not understand
              that to be the policy. I believe in progress and in the law as it is on our statute
              book. My experience, limited as it is, is that the defendant labors under a
              disadvantage, and that he has no advantage over the State - under the present law. He
              is brought from the jail and comes before the court with a bitter, unyielding
              prejudice against him; - we would rather believe evil of the man than good. He is
              generally without property and influence, is confronted by the whole State: Then he is
              confronted by a numerous array of witnesses; and in many cases possibly, the witnesses
              are brought into court under the influence of this prejudice that exists against the
              defendant. Many are actuated, not by a desire to see justice done, but by motives of
              revenge. In the mean time you close the mouth of the defendant. If he has an
              explanation of the charge; if he has knowledge, or is in possession of knowledge which
              if it could come before the court would satisfy the jury that he is innocent, it is
              locked up. He is not allowed to testify. Confronted by the State and her witnesses,
              and all opportunity to testify on his part cut off, and yet gentlemen complain that he
              has a great advantage in the trial of criminal cases in Indiana. They say it is wrong
              to give the defendant the closing argument, because it has great power over the jury.
              In some cases it may and in many cases it ought to; but these gentlemen seem to think
              a jury in Indiana is incapable to determine the law and the evedence: and that any
              attorney may mislead them. I have confidence in the intelligence of the people of the
              State of Indiana that when an issue is being tried between the State and a criminal,
              they can do justice notwithstanding the appeal made in the closing argument.</p>
            <p>If there is any great power or advantage in the closing argument, that ought to be
              given to the accused, because the principle upon which law proceeds is that
              ninety-nine guilty men should go unpunished than one innocent man should suffer. The
              Senator from Jackson [Mr. Brown] says that the rule should not obtain in Indiana. He
              says it is necessary for security and protection to society that innocent men sometime
              should suffer. We cannot afford to reverse the old rule;we cannot afford to say that
              an innocent man shall be prosecuted and probably sent to the penitentiary. I hope the
              bill will be indefinitely postponed.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE. I desire to occupy the time of the Senate only a few minutes to answer
              arguments against the indefinite postponement of this bill. We should look at this
              subject without prejudice. We should view the man that is brought into a criminal
              court as an unfortunate person. We should regard him, if we regard the principles of
              law, as being innocent until the evidence makes him guilty. That is the humane
              principle upon which all our criminal codes are built. Is there not a morbid, diseased
              state of the public mind at this time in regard to that principle? Do they recognize
              this principle that every man is presumed to be innocent until the contrary is clearly
              proven? Does not the practice in the United States at this time show that is not true
              ? When a man is brought before a court of justice and confined in the county jail to
              await his trial do you not see it proclaimed everywhere that such and such an
              individual is guilty of such and such crimes and should be punished thus and thus? Is
              that not true? If it is true as I am now stating it, are we not drifting away from
              this old principle that should govern men everywhere: - that principle recognized by
              Blackstone, the great Bible of the legal profession - that it is far better ninety and
              nine guilty persons should escape than that one innocent man should suffer? I think we
              are drifting away from that. It is public opinion that frames the minds that are to
              try the criminal. It is that same public opinion of the same State that is to try the
              man, that furnishes the jury. It is true he may object to a certain mumber, but after
              that his mouth is closed. The cry of the times is for "Blood!" "more Blood !" Why is
              this, my friends?</p>
            <p>I want you to look about you and see how it is. You have a State prison at
              Jeffersonville and another at Michigan City and you are proposing to make another. Why
              is it? Is it that criminals go unwhipped of justice, or is it because justice is
              meeted out? At Jeffersonville there are three hundred and at Michigan City we have
              three hundred and fifty. The law is penning the criminals up and yet the cry goes out
              from Jackson county "more Blood - let us have it," and if the courts will not
              administer justice in accordance with that cry they take and execute them without
              Judge and without witnesses I It is said by the gentleman from Jackson [Mr. Brown]
              that there is no State in the Union that allows the criminal the right to close but
              the State of Indiana. Is the gentleman speaking correctly in that matter? verily, not
              so. I have no doubt the gentleman from Jackson thought so, yet I understand it is not
              true and should not be taken as true.</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH (interposing.) In what other States does that practice prevail?</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE. In the State of Iowa.</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH. Any other?</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE. Yes sir, there are others but I do not know just what they are. I think
              the law is right as we have it to-day. It is said that the prisoner has the advan- <pb
                n="484" xml:id="VAA8558-14-484"/> tage every way. Tell me gentlemen, Senators, how
              it is the defendant has the advantage, when he is generally without money and often
              without friends ? How is it that he has the ability to obtain the ablest counsel in
              the county and the State of Indiana has not the means of putting competent men to the
              work of the prosecution ? If it is so whose fault is it? I think the State has
              advantages enough and is asserting her right sufficiently strong at this time. The
              prisoner cannot testify in his own behalf like a man in a civil suit. In a matter of
              dollars and cents A, B, and C can testify, but when it comes to testifying in a matter
              in which a man's possessions, his character his life and his blood is at stake you say
              "no, sir, sit dumb there. You have no right to be heard; and we will have council,
              able and skilled in the law to close the case against you."</p>
            <p>In addition to that, after it is all done, the popular cry of the country is that men
              are going unwhipped of justice: that criminals are not sent to the State's prison as
              often as they ought to be. Does the history of the State show that to be the case? Go
              to the record of the late Governor and see how many convicts he has seen proper to
              pardon, and you would be astonished at the cry now being made for more convictions.
              You see the Supreme Court continually setting aside verdicts rendered under the same
              cry against criminals and yet it is still insisted that there are advantages in favor
              of the criminal. Build your laws upon the eternal principles of truth and justice to
              all men, and my word for it you will be doing right.</p>

          <p> Mr. Woollen's bill [H. R. 24] for an act to provide designated Depositories for the
            Public Funds in the several counties, and to provide for the enforcement thereof was
            taken up in order - the question being on the third reading.</p>
          <p>Mr. WILSON of Ripley. Mr. Speaker: The law now makes the State Treasurer responsible
            for the public funds: and it seems to me that the question here is, whether the people
            shall leave the man whom they elect for the purpose, as the keeper of the public funds,
            or whether the public funds shall be transformed and distributed amongst the banks in
            the several counties. As it appears to us from the country the only pressure for the
            passage of this bill is in the desire to accommodate some county Treasurers and officers
            with the privilege of loaning the public funds and making money out of the operation. I
            do not think the people demand this bill. Is may be demanded by a few moneyed
            centers.</p>
          <p>Mr. RICHAKDSON. This is a bill really in the interest of the bankers and it would lead
            to competition amongst the bankers as to who shall be treasurer. I do not think it
            either wisdom or good policy to furnish money for such a purpose. While it may save four
            to six per cent, to the people, the barikers will realize from it from eight to fifteen
            per cent. The bankers will receive from it three times as much as the people. The farmer
            is obliged to pay ten per cent, in advance for his loans from the banks. In my opinion
            the bill is a movement in the direction of high taxation; and I hope it will not
            pass.</p>
          <p>Mr. LENFESTY. This bill should receive very careful consideration. As the law now
            stands the officer who is charged with custody of the public funds is an elective
            officer, and he is required to give sufficient bonds. This bill entirely changes the
            arrangementit proposes that the Commissioners as well as the Governor, Auditor and
            Treasurer of State shall be designated as depositors. But it seems to me that the bill
            is defective as to the requirement of bonds, and that the people might be left without
            security for their money; for it says: "if in their judgment, the safety of the funds
            require it, the bank shall give a bond."</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN (interposing.) It requires absolutely that the banks shall give bonds as an
            individual.</p>
          <p>Mr. LENFESTY. Well, that does away with one of the objections which I intended to
            submit. - But there is this objection to it: It takes the funds out of the hands of the
            men whom the people of the counties have selected to be their Treasurers and puts them
            into the hands of bankers or banking associations; and it does not even require that the
            funds shall be kept in the county. I re- <pb n="486" xml:id="VAA8558-14-486"/> gard this
            as an unwholsome provision. And there is yet another objection.</p>
          <p>In many counties of the State they have gone to considerable expen&amp;e to procure
            suitable vaults for the security of the county funds. Now this bill requires the county
            Commissioners to designate banks instead of these vaults. I think the men whom we elect
            for the purpose are better and more reliable as custodians of the public funds than
            those banks which may be designated. I believe the bill would open a door for
            corruption; and I do not believe that the county Commissioners should have the
            discretion to say in this way, that the people have made an unfit selection of
            treasurer. The law should provide, and it does now provide, that any interest which may
            accumulate on the public funds shall become a part of them: and when these banks shall
            realize their ten per cent, on the public funds, what part of these proceeds will belong
            to the people?</p>
          <p>Mr. WALKER. If the House should see proper to vote this bill down; I hope it will be
            done upon better grounds than upon those confused ideas of gentlemen who have said that
            it is in the interest of the banks ; but I do not believe it is right to vote the bill
            down simply because somebody says it is in the interest of the banks. This first
            question should be determined against the banks before we vote against the bill. But as
            I understand it, it is not in the interest of the banks, but in the interest of the
            people. It is found upon that principle of law which governs trustees who hold trust
            funds for the benefit of third parties. The party must know that the accumulations of
            interest go with and form a part of the fund; and this bill seeks to carry this
            principle to the officers of the State and the counties.</p>
          <p>Now, it is not known to all, that the accumulations of interest on the public funds do
            not always follow the fund, but find their way into the pocket of the custodian ? It has
            come to be a common saying, that a man wants to be State Treasurer in order to grow rich
            upon the interest proceeds of the State's funds: and the county treasurers in many
            counties, it is said, receive large bonuses for the county funds committed by them to
            the banks. Now it should be, that all the county moneys should find their way into the
            treasury vaults, and there remain: but the history of the State has shown that all the
            legislation in the world can't lock up these funds and their accumulations in the
            State's vaults and confine them there. It is even made a penitentiary offense for a
            treasurer to allow the deposit of a single dollar of the public funds in his custody.
            That is the law in the State of Ohio, and there is not a county treasurer in the State
            who follows the letter of that law. And the history of our State shows that the funds of
            the State are not in the vaults and safes of the State, but in the banks, and the
            proceeds going in the pockets of the officers.</p>
          <p>Now, if we can't keep these public funds in the public vaults, should not their
            proceeds go with the funds to the credit of the people? But supposing the banks do get
            profits, does it not come back to you again ? It is drawing interest for you to loan to
            your banks again. But if you lock it up in your vaults you get no interest.</p>
          <p>This bill proceeds upon the assumption that you can't keep it in the vaults; and that
            the proceeds shall follow the funds. For it is known that even the treasurer loans the
            school fund in the treasury, and reports no money; and so he shortens the terras of the
            common schools whilst he is drawing ten per cent interest on it! Under this bill these
            officers must show by affidavit what every dollar of the fund has accumulated. Is not
            that a geod provision ? Now, it is said, that whenever the depository is named the bonds
            of the officer is released to the extent of the deposit: and that is true. But how is it
            ? No bank can get their funds till they have executed a bond to the satisfaction of the
            treasurer, the other officers of State and the county Commissioners. But you say that
            you can't realize more than six per cent. Well, if all the funds belonging to the
            counties and the State were loaned securely at six per cent. - look at the amount that
            would be accumulating for the people. I do not believe that the people generally know
            anything at all of the amount of the accumulations of interest on their county and State
            funds.</p>
          <p>Mr. GIVAN. Does the bill compel the depositories to pay interest ?</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. Yes. That matter is left with the Commissioners. They must make a contract
            with the depositories for a certain sum. I do not understand that the bill compels the
            Commissioners to select depositories, if none can be obtained.</p>
          <p>Mr. WILSON of Ripley. Suppose the money is repaid to the custodian, he cannot be
            released. Whenever monev is loaned in any way by a custodian, he and his bondsmen are
            liable.</p>
          <p>Mr. LENFESTY. Under this hill there is no more money to be kept in the Treasury vaults
            than what is necessary to do the ordinary business of the office. Now, when there is but
            one bank in the county, I ask whether the Commissioners are not compelled to direct the
            treasurer to deposit the public money with such bank, whether it is worth a dime or
            not?</p>
          <p>Mr. WALKER. No sir ; it is not obligatory at all. All this matter is left with the
            Commissioners. If there is no safe bank in the <pb n="487" xml:id="VAA8558-14-487"
            />county, they send to the most convenient one. That is the way I understand the
            provisions of the bill. I have examined the bill myself; and I believe it is carefully
            drawn.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN interposed and read the provisions of the bill under discussionfrom the
            third, fifth, and eighth sections.</p>
          <p>Mr. WALKER. That is the way I thought it was : that unless they agree to do so, the
            provision does not imperatively require the County Commissioners to name a depository.
            Now, if the House is willing to say that all the accumulations of interest on the public
            funds shall follow the fund, let it be so. Are not the Commissioners as com-petetent to
            determine the depositories and their bonds as any party can be? I do not believe that
            when the State fixes the value of the services of a man in office and pays him for it, I
            do not believe he should have any perquisites.</p>
          <p>Mr. SATTERWHITE. When this bill first came up I was decidedly in favor of it. And if
            there is any man on this floor whose financial interests demand that this bill should
            pass, I am that man. But, after studying over it, I think now it is my duty to vote
            against it.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN (interposing.) Does the gentleman wish to have it changed?</p>
          <p>Mr. SATTERWHITE. Yes. The bill makes it the duty of the county Commissioners to deposit
            at the county seats, and it makes it the duty of the Governor, Auditor, and Treasurer of
            State to deposit at Indianapolis. Now, I am in the banking business at Martinsville; and
            I insist upon this being changed.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. Does the gentleman insist that the bank down in Martinsville shall have a
            part of the State funds?</p>
          <p>Mr. SATTERWHITE. Yes: I think the banks throughout the State ought to have the right to
            call for a portion of the State funds at Indianapolis. But, like the gentleman from
            Ripley [Mr. Wilson,] I think the State should not go into the banking business: and I am
            not sent here to legislate for the interest of the First National Bank at Martinsville.
            What I would prefer is such legislation as would make the taxes collectable half yearly:
            so making the people their own bankersinstead of their efficers. I have had some
            experience in this business. The county Commissioners are liable to temptations. They
            have their friends: and there is no use in denying that they may be corrupted when
            corrupting influences are brought to bear on them.The banks want the public fundswould
            be glad for you to deposit the county funds and the State funds. But the Commissioners
            will come to one of the banks and ask them ; what will you pay for the deposit of these
            funds. They will reply : we will pay two per cent. - no more. They may go to
            Martinsville and ask them: and they will say: two per cent. - no more. I tell you
            plainly sir, that the bankers can and will make rings and control the rate of interest
            on these funds. Therefore I hope the bill will not pass.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. I certainly can join the gentleman from Morgan in wishing that this bill
            may not pass. I suppose a portion of the members of this House can remember the time
            when the public funds were scattered all over the State. I do not myself remember very
            particularly as to the State's losses in such cases; but I can recollect the time when
            we paid here one per cent, for the money borrowed for the pay of members of the
            Legislature; when at the same time the Treasurer had loaned out the State's money : and
            the State never got it back again - it was lost.</p>
          <p>This bill proceeds upon an incorrect principle. I wish to state the theory I have upon
            this matter. The legislative action of our State for the last four years cannot be
            justified upon any sound principle. The correct theory is, that the State shall take
            from the taxpayers no more money than is absolutely necessary to carry on the
            government.</p>
          <p>The gentleman from Morgan is correct in his statement that there is pending before the
              <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName> a bill allowing the semi-annual payment
            of the taxes: and the result of such a statute would be to leave six months longer in
            the pockets of the tax-payers one-half of the taxes : and it would result in bringing
            the periods of the collection and paying out of the public funds near the same date - so
            the taxes would be disbursed - sent back to the people in the shortest time possible.
            The object is to admit of no heavy working balances either in the State or the county
            Treasuries. At the proper time, I shall urge it upon the House to adopt this theory.</p>
          <p>I want to say also that we carried into the treasury four years ago a surplus of
            fifteen hundred thousand dollars ; and if that had not been there we would be worse off:
            that a large amount of money was taken out of that surplus by men that had no business
            in the treasury. I suppose gentlemen are all conversant with the trouble about the
            distribution of the school fund, which could not be got. The theory of the law is that
            it shall be in the State Treasury. I recollect one prominent man switched off six
            hundred thousand dollars on the side track,placing it where certain parties could get
            it; and how much trouble we had with a certain banker in this city when the case was
            pending about the law for the distribution of this six hundred thousand dollars. I
            recollect <pb n="488" xml:id="VAA8558-14-488"/> seeing a banker, living not a hundred
            miles away, so scared about it that his hair is white yet, perhaps, for fear he could
            not get the money back. And many others were in his condition.</p>
          <p>If I am not misinformed, one lumber-yard in this city had fifty thousand dollars of it;
            which is more than any one lumber yard ought to have. But now, sir; let us pass that
            semi-annual tax-paying bill by which the taxpayer will have the discretion to pay in
            April and November: for all we want is to keep a working balance in the Treasury; and
            that will not admit of deposits of the public funds for more than three months: and for
            such temporary deposits no bank will pay more than three per cent. For, if you go to a
            bank with a certain amount of money and tell them you want to make a deposit on
            interest(I talk about banks doing a solid business)they will ask you at once: how long
            are you going to leave it? I know of no bank that would pay anything, or even talk about
            paying anything on a deposit for thirty or forty days. Then the idea of accumulations of
            interest from this source is merely idle - visionary. Then there are but two periods in
            the year at which the banks can afford to pay for money, and at all other times they
            generally have a surplus: and probably, at the very time the State wants her money, the
            banks also will want money. All the schools commence in the fall of the year, when that
            fund must go immediately for their support: and, I ask you, what bank would give you
            anything for money to be checked out for the payment of our public school teachers? I
            tell you, sir, there is no sound bank that would pay you a single cent for it.</p>
          <p>At the proper time, I shall move to change the title of this bill, so that it will
            read: "A bill to provide money to enable men to go into banking who have no money of
            their own:" for that is the plain English of the bill. I tell you, sir, if you designate
            these depositories you will incommode half the people of the State : and I understand
            that half the counties have not a good bank in them; and a great many banks are not
            sound: and no solid bank will give you a dollar of security outside of their corporation
            for the use of your money. I venture to say, that there is not a bank in the State that
            would go to any man outside of their bank for security for money that they can't keep
            more than three months. Then, how much would they pay for it? I know what deposits are
            worth. One and a half per cent, was all our concern could get for six months. The reason
            was, that no bank could pay more. But then, here is the necessary result: It's going
            backward. It seems most singular to me to see the gentleman from Johnson [Mr. Woollen]
            advocating this bill. Why, Old Hickory opposed its principle: and while I never
            supported him as a public man, I am willing to ask any man to go back and say whether
            Old Hickory was not right in this? - in the withdrawal of the government deposits from
            the old United States bank ? I believe it was one of the grandest things in our history
            for the manumission of the people from the shackles of concentrated capital.</p>
          <p>If there is any one thing, more than another to be feared in the future of this country
            it is the centraliztion of the money power: and this bill is but a proposition to
            centralize the money power of the State. But I say to all parties: if they want money to
            bank upon, let them get it; but so far as my vote is concerned, they shant have it out
            of the treasury of the State of Indiana. Were this bill to become law and live for six
            years, before one year these parties would be furnished with capital for banking. That's
            the object. But now, let us keep these things apart. For if you lend the public money so
            that the accumulations of interest shall increase the principal - how will it be that
            your officers can keep the money where they can get it to meet the wants of the treasury
            every day ?</p>
          <p>But now, certainly, so far as the State is concerned, she will have no money which she
            can afford to loan for the next two years. You will even have to borrow six hundred
            thousand dollars to carry on the government this year, or let your paper go to protest:
            and so it will be next year. Then let the banks and the bank men manage their own
            affairs.</p>
          <p>I have heard some gentlemen here say that their counties have lost money by the banks :
            and I know of one case down south where they have a little bank which they trusted : and
            while the county did not lose the money tbe officers did. Most counties get along well
            enough without the banks. And then again; I have not heard of the people anywhere
            demanding this thing. The demand for this bill comes from those who want the money. But
            the fair principle is that the tax-payers shall retain their money till tne State needs
            it; and when the State gets it, send it back again into the course of trade at the
            earliest moment.</p>
          <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. I differ from the gentleman from Jefferson. I advocate this bill as in the
            interest of the people: and I say to the gentleman that his position is in the interest
            of the bankers and office holders. And then, as to the public money, if it earns a
            dollar, it should belong to the people, and not to the public officers. Why, sir,
            perhaps a hundred millions of the national public funds has furnished a corruption fund
            to <pb n="489" xml:id="VAA8558-14-489"/> control the elections - a fund that has been
            run in the interest of the bank men! Do you say it is right then, for such men as these
            to take this money, get the interest on it and put it into their own pockets ?</p>
          <p>Mr. RICHARDSON asked if the money used to make the Republican party did not come from
            these officers ?</p>
          <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. I do not know where it came from. I suppose they used a good deal.</p>
          <p>Mr. SATTERWHITE. Did not the gentleman from Morgan and Johnson [Mr. Shirley] make the
            charge against me, that I furnished money to buy the Legislature four years ago:</p>
          <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. If the gentleman wants his question answered, I can answer it so that it
            will tell against him.</p>
          <p>The SPEAKER. The Chair rules the question to be out of order.Mr. SHIRLEY. What are the
            arguments against this bill? The gentleman from Jefferson says it will put the public
            funds into the hands of the banks, and they will use it. But they are using it now ; yet
            the gentleman stands here and opposes this bill. But I stand here against these public
            officers taking this money and using it.</p>
          <p>There are county officers not fifty miles away that take their county money, bring it
            here to Indianapolis, deposit it and pocket the proceeds. But I want to say here another
            word. The gentleman says: you must not collect the taxes faster than the State wants to
            use the money, and he even complains that the taxes were put too low two years ago, and
            he says, therefore we have not now enough money in the treasury. But when you levy
            taxes, you want to have them paid; and, I don't care what system you adopt, there will
            be accumulations in the Treasury. But when gentlemen say lock it up, I say that is a
            wrong policy. For if you aggregate the amount of money that is paid annually into the
            treasuries of the several States of this Union, you will find that it exceed the amount
            of the current circulation of the country.</p>
          <p>I can't see anything else in the opposition to this bill, but that it is in the
            interest of the office-holders. Why, sir, we have a law that any officer loaning the
            public funds shall be treated as a felon: yet they are doing this thing every day : and
            they make their defiant declarations to this effect: "Although I was guilty of a felony
            when I loaned this money and got the interest on it, yet, because I have it in my
            possession, you can't disturb me in that possession."</p>
          <p>I can see no reason, sir, why this idle money should not be loaned out, and the
            accumulations go to the people and become part of the principal. I doubt not that there
            are county treasurers and some State treasurers or those who would be such, that would
            be glad to see us voting against this bill; but I say here, that I am more willing to
            trust money in the hands of a bank, than to put it into the control of those officers
            who are loaning it out in every direction. As to the gentleman from Morgan, I understand
            that the bill has been amended to suit his notion.</p>
          <p>Mr. SATTERWHITE. Not exactly.</p>
          <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. It is not intended that this money shall be taken out of the vaults of the
            treasury when it is needed, but only when it is not needed. These officers have been
            getting interest on this money, and I would like to know why it is that they can get it
            and we can't? I believe the people may receive the interest as well as the officers. The
            bankers and the officers, as a class, have been in partnership in this matter; and this
            bill will break that up.</p>
          <p>The House now took a recess till two o'clock p. m.</p>
          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center"> AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
            <p>The SPEAKER resumed the chair at two o'clock p. m. and announced the consideration of
              Mr. Woollen's bill [H. R. 24] to provide Designated Depositories of the Public Funds
              in the several counties of the State, and to provide for the enforcement thereof - the
              question being, Shall the bill pass?</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to have the bill go over till next Thursday at
              two o'clock.</p>
            <p>VOICES. "No, no."</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. I make that motion.</p>
            <p>The motion was rejected - yeas 29 nays 46.</p>
            <p>Mr. BAKER demanded the previous question but there was no second by a majority of the
              House.</p>
            <p>Mr. GLASGOW moved that the bill be referred again to the committee with instructions
              to amend it in section three line four, by inserting after the word "counties" these
              words: "if there be one." Strike out the following clause, commencing in line seven:
              "if in their opinion the safety of the public funds demand it:" and strike out the
              proviso to said section which is in these words: "Provided, that when there shall be
              no proper bank, banking firm or association in a county lor such designated
              depository, then said Board of County Commissioners shall designate some bank, banking
              firm or association the most convenient to said county under the same conditions and
              regulations as heretofore named."He said the only change this will make is to take
              away from the commissioners the discretion as to requiring bonds, and striking out the
              proviso, so they can't take the money out of the county, <pb n="490"
                xml:id="VAA8558-14-490"/> I find that when there is no bank in the county it has but
              a small revenue; and I think it should be imparatively required that the banks should
              give tree hold security.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. About all that is required by the gentleman's amendment is found in the
              amended bill. The bill now provides that they shall keep five thousand dollars in the
              county, and all over that shall be deposited in the county bank, or other bank in some
              county contiguous.</p>
            <p>Mr. Glasgow's amendment was rejected; and the question recurred on the passage of the
              bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I desire to make a little speech on this question; a very
              few remarks - after gentleman have said what they desire to say upon it; and, if no
              gentleman desires to say any more, I will take that opportunity now.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. I prefer unrestricted debate.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. I would indeed, prefer that the matter might go over; because I have
              been very busy. I desire to say as far as any bank is concerned in this question, I
              have no interest directly or indirectly in any bank in the world. And if the bill
              would not enduce the public good, it is because I have made a mistake. And I say
              further that my experience is that the banks are opposed to it; and I do not want the
              fate of this bill decided by the argument that the banks are in favor of it, because
              as I have said the banks are opposed to it. - My friend from Morgan (Mr. Satterwhite)
              who has addressed the House was in favor of the bill and suggested many changes, but
              the majority were opposed to so many designated depositories. - Now what are the
              objects sought here? In the first place, when the State undertakes to deal with the
              banks; if she requires bonds it is for the security and safety of her funds beyond
              contingencies; and in the second place, it is that her funds shall not corrupt the
              public service and the bill is calculated to accomplish both of these ends.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. I desire to ask the gentleman if he is to make the closing argument?</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. I will answer that after I get through. I don't care how much argument
              there is to follow, but, if I should desire to do so I would reply. - This bill
              provides that, when, the money goes out of the hands of the Treasurer to the
              depositories, that they shall be under bonds. It is worth while to provide that these
              shall be safely in the bill, because this is a matter that requires the greatest
              safety. If my friend had fifty or a hundred thousand dollars in his posession, what
              could he do with it? He would go down street and place it in some safe bank where it
              would be as secure as if in his own hands. The banking institutions of this country
              are regarded as the safest places where money can be kept. And it in not a fact that
              the public money is placed there now by our Treasurers. Where are all the public funds
              deposited? - I dislike and disclaim what the gentleman from Jefferson has said about
              loaning the public funds. There is no proposition in the bill to loan the public
              funds. The funds are placed in the bank safes. The bank does not borrow it; but she
              pays a small interest for keeping it.</p>
            <p>Since this matter has been up here, I have inquired into the manner of obtaining this
              interest by the different treasurers throughout the State: and I have a letter from
              Lafayette in which it is estimated that a hundren and fifty thousand dollars of the
              public funds of that county have gone into the banks in the way of interest, and
              otherwise lost through them in the last ten years. Has it come to this? Why, sir, you
              may go in to almost any county of the State and find large amounts of property in the
              hands of the ex-treasurers of the counties: You will find them owners of palatial
              residences, every dollar of the cost of which has come from the interest proceeds of
              the public funds with which they have been entrusted.</p>
            <p>And I say, sir, that the public officers should not be held responsible for this: I
              do not believe it is right to hold the treasurers responsible for the accumulations of
              interest on the public funds. It is not logical to do so. If a treasurer has had the
              responsibility of taking care of the public funds and all the time he has been liable
              to pay it over - I say it's logical that he should be entitled to the interest. But
              you say the money should be placed in vaults; and it is not lawful nor right that it
              should be in the vaults and make the treasurer responsible for the funds. Why was not
              that thought of when the present law was passed ? Then if the treasurer is a bad man,
              there is no law that would bind his securities for the repayment of the money. If the
              proper county officers bind the depositories, they put the money down into these
              vaults.</p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, if I had the power to put these funds into the banks on interest, I
              venture to say that I would get five per cent, and in one year from thirty to forty
              thousand dollars would be the result of the earnings of the public money. Then why not
              do it ? Do we not all know that the public funds would be kept safely in these banks?
              The only difference is that if we do not pass this bill the individual treasurers will
              get the interest and the people will lose it. That is all the difference. It seems to
              me that the <pb n="491" xml:id="VAA8558-14-491"/> public good demands that this
              corruption that has crept into the civil service should be removed. </p>
            <p>There have been a great many objections made to the bill, but every one of them that
              has been valid has been removed by the amendments. In the first place the provision
              giving a discretion as to requiring bonds or not has been stricken out, and it has
              been made positive that the bonds - shall be required in all cases. There seems to be
              some idea that the worth of the bonds will depart if they be given by some one else
              beside the treasurer; and it is the argument of the gentleman from Jefferson [Mr.
              Branham] that if the depositories shall fail to pay over it would take some time to
              recover the money. Well, suppose the treasurer should fail - would it not take some
              time to recover it of him? The argument would reach both ways.</p>
            <p>It is the general opinion all over the State - it is well known - that the banks are
              in the habit of buying their way into the treasurer's office; and this is done with
              the expectation that they will make it up off the interest on the deposit of the
              public funds. The interest on the deposits I learn does not amount to a cent less than
              ten thousand dollars a year. That can't be denied; and we must consider this for the
              purpose of fixing a fee bill for these officers.</p>
            <p>It is not worth while, Mr. Speaker, to try to dodge this question. It is one that has
              been pressing upon the State for years. I have had some experience in the matter
              myself. So far as I am concerned I know that these abuses exist. I can say to the
              House here, that for four or five years, I paid interest on sums of four or five
              thousand dollars on money which I got from the county treasurer of my county - an
              average of about two thousand dollars a year. Is it possible that we can't remove
              these abuses? For this class of cases occur all over the State. The county had
              deposited in the bank of which I was President at the time some twenty-five to fifty
              thousand dollars, and we were paying the interest to the county Treasurer; the county
              Commissioners came to me and borrowed thirty thousand dollars for bridge building; and
              at the same time their treasurer was receiving interest on fifty thousand dollars from
              the same bank. And you can hardly find a township trustee that has not been corrupted
              by this system of dealing with the banks by the Treasurers.</p>
            <p>Again, justice to the securities of the treasurers demand that something should be
              done. When the treasurer gives his security, it is understood the security is
              responsible only in the event of failure of the treasurer: and the security knows
              nothing about the loaning.</p>
            <p>There is another thing here. When the Treasurer is elected he determines to place
              this money in some bank, and he goes to such bank and asks them to go upon his bond as
              security. The banks do go upon his bond; and so he becomes the mere tool of the banks.
              Then, if the bank breaks, the stockholders break, and the bond of the treasurer goes
              down with it.</p>
            <p>This is a monstrous abuse that is corrupting every branch of the civil service, and
              it demands that the representatives of the people should take hold of it. I recollect
              now a heathen myth. It is said of Hercules, son of Jupiter by one of his wives, that
              when he was an infant and began to show signs of the great power in him, he became an
              object of hatred to Juno; and she sent two serpents to destroy him. But when they came
              upon him, comprehending the situation, the infant Hercules rose and took them each by
              the throat and strangled them. And I say now, that the representatives of the people
              here, like Hercules, should rise in their might and strangle this serpent; and no
              minor interest should prevent the execution of this thing. If it can be cured by
              legislation let us apply the remedy and remove the evil.</p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, there are some counties in the State that are particularly exercised in
              regard to this question of interest. The county of the gentleman from Morgan [Mr.
              Satterwhite] has had some experience in this matter ; and I am astonished that my
              friend has fallen in the path he has. I can remember the time when, if a man had a
              county order in his pocket, he would have to carry it for years before he could
              collect it not because there was not money in the treasury, but because the treasurer
              was loaning it, and would endorse the order, "No money in the treasury."</p>
            <p>Mr. SATTERWHITE (interposing.) Do the people have the remedy?</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN continuing. You ought not to allow this evil. When you issue an order on
              the treasury you ought to have the money to pay it. Ten minutes delay in a good bank
              would take away its reputation. I would never be put off with words : "Remedy,
              remedy:" I want the moneynot the remedy.</p>
            <p>This bill requires the Governor, Auditor and Treasurer of the State to go with it
              where the public funds deposited will be safe. They can't go to the irresponsible
              banks ; for in addition to the character, the responsibility of the bank, the bill
              requires also the outside security.</p>
            <p>Now, Mr. Speaker, there has to be some other argument to defeat this bill, than those
              which have been submitted yet in this discussion. - It has been asked as an amend- <pb
                n="492" xml:id="VAA8558-14-492"/> ment to the bill, that it should provide that the
              public funds be scattered over the State. This bill now provides that the State funds
              shall be kept at the capitol of the State. My friend from Morgan desired that they
              might go elsewhere. I desire, sir, that the provisions of the bill should be so well
              and safely guarded, that, if it becomes law, no evil consequences could come out of
              it, because I know the author of a bill is always likely to be held responsible for
              the evils coming from it; and I thought the depositories of the State funds should be
              right where those who deposit them reside. And we all know that if there is anything
              the matter with the banks - if the air is filled with the least whisper as to their
              solvency - those chiefly interested in the neighborhood are all alive to it. Hence, if
              the banks become a little shaky, the State officers would be first to find it out; and
              hence I could not accommodate my friend from Morgan.</p>
            <p>He then came and required a provision that the majority should govern in the choice
              of the depositories. I yielded to this; and the gentleman gained confidence. Then he
              wanted the bill to be so drawn that the Savings Banks anywhere in the State could get
              the State funds by giving the proper security. But that could not be, for then the
              bill would be exposed to the objection of my friend from Jefferson, and his objection
              would be reasonable. I am afraid there is a little mystery behind this. I offer no
              objection to debate, however, but I have objections to arguments against the bill from
              personal considerations.</p>
            <p>A gentleman of this city came up and said to me: "You will have to change the bill to
              suit my views, or you can't pass it:" and I felt humiliated at being thus addressed as
              a representative of the people.</p>
            <p>And another objection was made by the gentleman from Carroll [Mr. Richardson.] He
              simply said that the bill would make competition between the banks as to who should be
              treasurer. But the gentleman did not seem to consider that the banks are very envious
              of each other. Do we not know that is the case now ? Under the present system the
              banks are vying with each other as to the getting hold of the treasurer ; because he
              has the control of the county funds; and in a great many instances they get him. They
              always go with the party that has the majority. A man who is dealing in dollars and
              cents does not care anything about politics.</p>
            <p>Mr. RICHARDSON (interposing.) would say in reply, that the banks tried to get a
              treasurer with us and failed : and the treasurer in my county is a Republican. So my
              argument is not political.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. Now, Mr. Speaker, I just want to close with this reflection and a single
              remark: This is not a full House: and gentlemen who are going to unite against this
              bill know there is not a full House.</p>
            <p>A VOICE. "I was acting treasurer of his county for a while, and I know."</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. Every gentleman knows that there have been great wrongs perpetrated on
              the part of the banks in regard to the interest on the public funds; and if this bill
              does not meet the evil then I can't find the remedy. If you hold the treasurer
              responsible for the funds, it seems to me that you can't hold him accountable for the
              interest: and, you may make as many laws as there are people in the State, but so long
              as you do not require the depositories to be in a certain place yon cannot hold
              them.</p>
            <p>Mr. SATTERWHITE. I did go to the gentleman with my suggestions. I believe, in the
              first place, that the county money should be kept at the county seat: and I happen to
              be in business myself at a county seat, and I would like to have a chance at these
              funds. I also believe that the banks outside of Indianapolis ought to have a chance at
              the funds of the State - an opportunity for a part of the spoils.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. Did not the gentleman take an interest in the nomination of the present
              treasurer, with a view to control the deposits in his bank?</p>
            <p>Mr. SATTERWHITE. Of course I did; that was in my business. [Laughter.]</p>
            <p>The SPEAKER (with the hammer.) That question has no reference to the bill; it is not
              in order.</p>
            <p>Mr. SATTERWHITE. I wish to ask the gentleman from Johnson [Mr. Woollen] to point out
              a single bank that is opposed to this bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. The First National Bank in Martinsville. [Laughter.]</p>
            <p>Mr. SATTERWHITE. Was not the gentleman spoken to by a banker of this city ?</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. There were two: One was my brother who tried to get me to stop this
              thing; and the other was the president of the association who was joining my friend
              from Morgan. [Laughter.]</p>
            <p>Mr. SATTERWHITE. While the bill provides that the people shall furnish money to bank
              upon, one of its provisions excluded me : therefore I wanted a share in the
              spoils.</p>
            <p>Mr. GIVAN. One of the principal arguments of the gentleman from Johnson county is,
              that this bill provides additional safety for the keeping of the public funds. I ask
              the gentleman if I am not correct in this?</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN assents.</p>
            <p>Mr. GIVAN. It certainly does not afford any additional security, but it renders the
              se- <pb n="493" xml:id="VAA8558-14-493"/> curity now fixed by law of a doubtful
              character. If I understand the bill, it provides that, when the Treasurer makes his
              deposit in the bank, he is released from his bonds to the extent of that deposit; but
              the law now holds the Treasurer to his responsibility in full. And although the
              present law requires the Treasurer to deposit in a certain place yet if he losses, the
              people do not lose. Now, if the Treasurer is released by this bill to the amount of
              his deposit, then it does not provide complete security for the public funds; it would
              not be as safe and secure as it is under the law now. Instead of having one party
              liable, as the law now is, you have the liability divided between two, three and four
              depositories: and I submit this question; which is the most secure, the obligation of
              one sworn officer, or the obligations of half a dozen others? It seems to me that
              obligations required of one man who is an officer of the law is more secure to the
              people than the obligations of those who have not these responsibilities and sanctions
              resting on them. - To whom do these public funds belong? To the State the counties and
              the townships. Now supposing this money goes into the hands of the depository, (and
              the county treasurer released from his bonds to that extent,) how do you suppose he is
              to make out his report? shall he say how much of the deposit belongs to the State, how
              much to the county, and how much to the township? And if you adopt this bill you do
              not wipe out the township treasurer entirely? What is the use of him if the county
              Treasurer discharges the duties of his office? Why not abolish it, and appoint a clerk
              in his place? Abolish the office and save expenses? Then under the proposed act your
              county Treasurer has no discretion whatever in this matter; but whenever the Board of
              County Commissioners say deposit the public funds then he must deposit them.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. I agree with the gentleman from Johnson (Mr. Woollen) when he says there
              is an evil in this matter. But he is not a wise legislator who legislates through
              impulse. The times has been extraordinary; and the condition of the revenue has been
              extraordinary; and I submit to the gentleman from Johnson whether it would be safe to
              base our estimates for the future upon the results in the past? There is an old adage:
              "An ounce of preventative is worth a pound of cure:" and the point I make here is
              this; we propose to change the time of the collection of the tax levy; we propose to
              leave the levy in the hands of the tax-payers till near the time when the State wants
              it, that this work of interest accumulations on it shall not take place. It is true
              that in the last four years there have been extraordinary accumulations in the
              treasury of the State which it is not likely will be the case again. One of these
              items of accumulation was the Sinking Fund; and the last Legislature provided for its
              distribution. Then the bill is to be reported from the committee on Ways and Means,
              allowing the taxes to be collected half-yearly - this will take away one half from the
              State Treasury. It will not be in the State Treasury and if it were in the Connty
              Treasuries they could not afford it, because it would be demanded of them almost
              immediately.The gentleman says the bill does not propose that the banks will use this
              money but that they would pay a nominal interest on the same for the purrpose of
              keeping it! - If there is such a bank on this continent I should like to know it.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. I do not want it to go the country that I made such a foolish
              statement.</p>
            <p>Mr. RICHARSON. I was going to ask the gentleman from Johnson to explain that.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. What I said was this: that a banker never talks about his deposits as
              being loans.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. The case in his own county, of which the geutleman made a statement,
              seems to me very extraordinary also. He says, that while the Treasurer of that county
              had fifty thousand dollars of the funds of the county in the hands of the bank of
              which he was president, the commissioners of the same county came to the same bank and
              borrowed thirty thousand more! Now, sir, I ask what remedy there is for such a state
              of things? Why can't this thing be repeated if the county treasurer can thus bid
              difiance to the commissioners? Why can't the same case occur under the the gentleman's
              bill?</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. While they were borrowing at ten per cent. - and the funds belonging the
              to county - their treasurer was receiving interest on that money. If the county had
              been getting the interest on the money it would have been a different thing.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM resuming. I will make two points now instead of one. It comes back to the
              point, that the proper custodians of the public money is the people themselves; and
              that it should not be taken from the people till the public necessities require it. -
              The gentleman said also, that he was informed that Tippecanoe county has lost one
              hundred and fifty thousand dollars of their county funds.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN (in his seat.) I do not vouch for it.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. If the gentleman does not vouch for the correctness of the letter why
              does he introduce it?</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. The writer of it is a <pb n="494" xml:id="VAA8558-14-494"/> gentleman of
              standing, and that is his estimate.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. I recollect hearing the gentleman describe a certain notorious man of
              chivalry that had trouble in the wine cellar; and I think that letter ought to go
              along with that chivalrous hero of Cervantes. It should not be introduced here as an
              argument. It is a good deal Don Quixotish; for while he thinks the blood of his
              adversary is flowing, it's nothing but wine.</p>
            <p>But the gentleman has not made any attack on the position I take, which is this :
              that we should so shape the revenue laws that not a dollar shall be taken from the
              people till the public necessities require it; and then, that it shall go back to the
              people as soon as possible. While I have great confidence in the gentleman from
              Johnson, I am obliged to say that his figures are too large here.</p>
            <p>I tell you again sir, that in our legislation we should avoid the influences of
              concentrated capital. If there is anything that can bid defiance to the power of the
              people it is the power of concentrated capital: and I am unwilling to make the people
              tributary to this power.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. I want to ask the gentleman if his own county is not now, or perhaps
              soon will be, going to vote a tax of two hundred thousand dollars upon her people for
              railroad purposes?</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. There is a scheme of that kind pending: but I do not know whether it
              will carry or not.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. Well, if it does carry, I want to know what he is going to do with the
              money till it goes to the railroad company?</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. I wish to say a word to the House as to my vote on that bill. Personally
              I was opposed to that bill. It was under the direction of my constituents that I voted
              for it. But I want to say to the gentleman that there is now in the files of the House
              a bill that places in the hands of the Commissioners the power to suspend the tax till
              the work shall be done. Now, sir, it is not right to go out into that line of
              argument. The gentleman puts me in mind of a Gatlin gun: his balls are not heavy, but
              they come too fast, and a person does not know when he is going to be hurt. I have
              heard men complain that there were a hundred millions of dollars locked up in the
              Treasury of the United States, and Boutwell would not let it out. And I just want to
              say to the House that no hundred millions ever paid the Government so well as that
              hundred millions which Boutwell locked up; and this is the reason : The moneyed men
              had made gold an article of trade, and they had made "corners" on gold. Now, what was
              the object of retaining that hundred millions? We all remember when gold was worth two
              hundred per cent. I happened to be in the city of New York on that "Black Friday." The
              object was to say to those gold rings in New York : You shant make a corner on gold
              that shall paralize the industry of the country, I was in New York when that document
              canie which put those millions on the market, and kept them on the market, for that
              very object; and no hundred millions ever effected a better purpose.</p>
            <p>Now, sir, we do not want anything of this kind. It's true, if we had reached specie
              payments, we should not want that hundred millions; but so long as the gold corners
              are there, so long these checks are necessary.But there was another shot from the
              man's Gatlin gun. He says the banks loaned money to manage the elections. But then
              nearly half the counties in the State are democratic. In Johnson county they may have
              used their money in that way ; but in the counties below and above here they used it
              the other way. However, I do not know anything particularly about that, nor much about
              anything else. But you concentrate capital, and then it's loaned at the dictation of
              two or three men: and this cannot be the case when it is distributed all over the
              State. Herein is the reason why I am opposed to this bill. I say: Let the State take
              charge of and control, her funds; and let the several counties manage theirs. But I
              wish to ask the gentleman if we ought to clear these bank men, if the county
              treasurers get the money?</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN answered affirmatively.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. But are these parties into whose hands gentlemen propose to put this
              money anything more than mortal men? liable to bad influences, like the rest of us?
              Where will you find one of them that is not selfish to the bottom? I say: it's a
              dangerous thing to put these funds anywhere. I don't care what the banks want. I have
              not much in money or stocks, and never expect to have much. It's probably true - that
              letter which the gentleman from Johnson quoted - that Tippecanoe county has lost one
              hundred and fifty thousand dollars by her treasurer and the banks.</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLEN. I said in ten years the loss on all the funds of the county.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM. I hope, sir, that this bill will not pass ; but I do hope the House will
              pass the Committee's bill to admit of the collection of the taxes half yearly.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. I want to say to the gentleman from Jefferson that I did not refer to
              the National Treasury. I said that a hundrrd millions of dollars had been obtained
              through the banks and used as a cor- <pb n="495" xml:id="VAA8558-14-495"/> ruption
              fund in the elections - used by the National Banks. And I alluded to this to show the
              evil growing out of the system of allowing the public officers to use the public funds
              for their own advantage. I want the elections pure. I want to see the time when money
              cannot be used to buy votes and to control nominations and elections. And it is my
              effort to take the public funds out of the hands of these officers who trade with the
              banks upon them. I do not want to concentrate capital. I regard this bill as a measure
              in the interest of the people, and against the machinations of the banks and the
              public officers.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM (interposing.) The gentleman makes the argument that the National Banks
              used the money in elections; - how then did it come that they were beaten in this
              State.</p>
            <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. I don't know; the National Treasury is bigger than the State Treasury.
              [A laugh.] I will say once more, in conclusion : I am not acting in the interest of
              any bank, and never was. I believe this bill is in the interest of the people. The
              gentleman says he wants the taxes paid semi-annually, so as to avoid accumulations of
              large sums in the treasury. But that bill may not pass ; and if it does, the friends
              of this bill only ask, that when there is money in the hands of the treasurer, not to
              be used for some time, he shall not put the money out at interest, and the proceeds
              into his pocket - a thing which we all know the treasurers now do, even down to the
              punny office of township trustee: and it is charged that the school trustees are
              getting into this practice.</p>
            <p>Sir, there will always be public funds in the hands of the treasurers. But if you say
              there will be no money soon, that is no reason why we should not provide that under
              the next pet of officers it shall be used in such a way that the people shall get the
              benefit of it. It's now narrowed down to the question, whether the proceeds of the
              interest on the public funds shall go to the people or the officers? Gentlemen can
              take their choice. I will take mine.</p>
            <p>Mr. BARRETT. I can't see why it is that the gentleman from Jefferson fights this bill
              so hard. Does he expect to become State or county Treasurer? He says also that the
              State has become so poor she has no money. Then why fight the bill? If the State have
              no money the banks will not get hold of it. And if he is going to manage the funds so
              that there will be no money to be loaned - if he is going to arrange the law so that
              the money will be paid out as fast as it is collected - what is he afraid of? But he
              knows very well that there will be money on hand in the treasury which should go on
              deposit. Does he want to continue the present practice, and not allow the proceeds of
              interest to go into the treasury to lesson the taxes of the people? We all know that
              the treasurers do not keep this money in their pockets. There is not a county
              treasurer in the State but makes deposits of the public funds. I will venture here to
              make this assertion: that if this bill becomes a law, the people of the State will
              receive in the way of interest at least two hundred thousand dollars annually, while
              now they receive not one cent.</p>
            <p>Mr. BRANHAM (interposing.) The gentleman states, that, if this bill pass, the people
              will gain two hundred thousand dollars annually. That is the interest on four millions
              at five per cent.</p>
            <p>Mr. BARRETT. I think there is more than that; when we take all the funds of the
              State, Counties, and Townships: I think they would aggregate more than five million
              dollars. If the gentleman is going to get up a bill providing that the treasurers
              shall not deposit their funds in the banks, then there will be consistency in his
              opposition to this. But it seems that he is willing that the Treasurer shall continue
              to deposit in the banks, without the banks giving any security. We fear that the
              treasurers will continue to deposit and we want the security and the interest.</p>
            <p>Mr. COBB. I have only a few words to say, and I should not care to occupy the time
              now from the fact that I have already had one speech against the bill; but there are
              one or two reasons that should prevent its passage. I have been a little surprised at
              the course the argument has taken. It is the first time in my life that I ever heard
              our democratic friends argue in favor of banks, in favor of concentrated capital and
              against the people; because the proposition here is to take the public funds out of
              the hands of the people and place them in the hands of three individuals here in
              Indianapolis on the part of the State, and of three individuals called county
              Commissioners on the part of each county of the State. And gentlemen seem to argue as
              though the State Treasurer and the county officers were about the only men in the
              State that ought not to be trusted. But now looking at the past and at the politics of
              the officers which the State has had for the last two years till within the past few
              days - this is a singular bill to come from the democratic side. - Well; gentlemen can
              draw their own conclusions. Is it that they do not want the Repnblicans to have any
              chance?</p>
            <p>Mr. WOOLLIN (enterposing.) I wish to ask the gentleman if he puts the argument on
              such a plea as that?</p>
            <p>Mr. COBB. I say this looks to me a little like political tricking. But there is
              another <pb n="496" xml:id="VAA8558-14-496"/> objection to the bill. They say it is a
              public outrage for the county Treasuries to get two or three per cent. on the public
              funds. Now I am in favor of their paying the interest when It becomes due; and I think
              every honest man would do that whether Republican or democrat. But to here our
              democratic friends talking as if they were in earnest in the matter, and saying that
              we should take the power of electing the custodians of the public fund out of the
              hands of the people, and take another class of custodians, and provide that they shall
              be elected by three individuals in each county, and three individuals for the State, -
              and then have the State and county Treasurers go into partnership with them and bank
              and speculate on the public funds! - I cannot think that the author of the bill was
              candid in spirit when he drafted it; nor do I think much of his candor when he used
              this expression: urging that the banks are safe places for the public money, he said
              they will pay interest for the privilege of keeping it! -They are not fools enough to
              handle money for nothing. And it is a proper use of the public funds, that they should
              speculate upon them? The effect will be to keep the money out as long as possible, and
              to put off the payment of the county orders as long as possible. The gentleman (Mr.
              Woollen) said that he knew of a case where a county had fifty thousand dollars
              deposited and, yet at the same time for a specific purpose they were obliged to borrow
              thirty thousand. But now I can suppose that perhaps it did not make much difference
              because perhaps the specific fund could not be used and perhaps the bank could use it;
              and when called up-no for it they could take somebody elses money. I know very little
              about banking, but I think there is in it about this principle; if a dozen men have
              deposits in the same bank, the bank can loan to the extent of one half the amount
              deposited with them; and then they can pay a good run of checks by taking somebody
              elses money, so using about three-forths of the amount of the money deposited with
              them - money that they would be obliged to pay back at any time.</p>
            <p>But now let us suppose one of the depositories to become a little shaky - what will
              they do? They will go to the county treasurer and insist that the trust shall not be
              paid back till they can make certain collections. It seems to me that it will cause
              the banks of the sound article to go into a dangerous partnership. The county
              Treasurers, in violation of official obligations do now receive four or five per cent,
              on these deposits; and we propose here not only to legalize that, but we propose to
              allow the banks to take these same funds and speculate on them loan them out and get
              ten per cent. interest on them: because if they did not get ten per cent none could
              see how they could pay the treasurers five per cent.</p>
            <p>It seems to me Mr. Speaker that we ought to adopt a course something like this: Let
              the people's custodians have charge of these funds and let them deposit wherever they
              have a mind to and make them answer under oath in their annual settlements how much
              profit they have made and if they have got it in bank, and then let them pay it all
              over. So, if your counties are ready to go into partnership with anybody in this
              matter let it be with the treasurers and not with a few men who are unknown to the
              people.</p>
            <p>Then there would not be those exposures to losses: because, one of the strongest
              objections that can be urged against this bill is this having three or four
              depositories, which would lead to confusion in regard to the liabilities. It would
              lead to interminable litigations to ascertain who is the responsible party. If the
              county or township wish to go into partnership with anybody or any bank, let the
              people select their men. The only reason why the present law fails is, because we have
              not a statute providing that treasurers shall deposit these funds in a certain
              place.</p>
            <p>This thing is so plain that it seems to me, if the House wished to strike at the
              evil, we would not take such a roundabout way of doing it, and a way of such doubtful
              constitutionality as this. For the constitution requires that there shall be elected
              by the people a State Treasurer; and that he shall be in fact the Treasurer - shall
              have in fact the custody and control of the public funds. The constitution provides
              also, that there shall be elected by the people amongst the other officers of the
              county, a county treasurer; and it seems to me that these treasurers should keep these
              funds according to the requirements of the Constitution; and if you can find any place
              in the Constiution which requires that the public funds shall be kept in some bank or
              banks, it is in some part of the Constitution which I have never found yet. - It seems
              to me, that, for every reason which I can conceive, this bill ought not to pass. It
              seems to me that the present law keeps these funds safely; and it seems to me further,
              that no member here, unless he have an interest in some banking institution, or in
              some one of those numerous rings, can, under any circumstances, vote for this
              bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. COWGILL. Mr. Speaker, I want to give some of my reasons for voting as I shall on
              this question. Under the existing law and the existing facts, I shall vote in favor of
              this bill. If we had a statute which allowed these funds to remain in the hands <pb
                n="497" xml:id="VAA8558-14-497"/> of the people until called for by the necessities
              of the government, then I would be satisfied with the law as it exists. But so long as
              there is no such law, I think there ought to be a law passed to cure the
              existingevils. It is a fact that there must accumulate a considerable amount of money
              in the treasuries of all the counties: and it is also a fact that these funds are used
              by the treasurers: and by this bill the question is raised whether these accumulations
              of interest on these funds shall be for the people or for the officers? That is the
              question under this bill. I can see no clanger in allowing these funds to be used in
              this way. And when so used those who are the owners of the funds should have the
              proceeds of the interest.</p>
            <p>Mr. KIRKPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I think too much legislation is not profitable. I have
              confidence in my county officers; and my vote on this bill will indicate the amount of
              confidence I have in them.</p>
            <p>Mr. MELLETT. I feel moved to say a word on this bill. If I could see by this bill any
              reasonable probability of saving any money to the people, of course, I should vote for
              it; because, like all others here, I am afraid of the people, and just now in their
              service. The day has passed when, by legislation, men can deceive the people about
              whom we talk so much. They are apt to unravel all mysteries. Time would determine
              whether the people would be benefitted by such a bill. I do not believe they would. I
              take it for granted, (but I do not grant it entirely,) that the State has an interest
              in the public funds - it is a deferred interest. But, sir, what will you get by this
              law? True you may get a nominal interest; but the practical effect will be to reduce
              the rate of interest. The banks will get the funds at their own price. They will
              combine. You just place it in their power to say what interest they will give. Why not
              fix the rate of interest in the bill? - establish a minimum - six per cent. - four per
              cent. - two per cent., or the fourth of one per cent.be sure that you are going to get
              something ? But then, anyway, the object of this bill would be to draw this money away
              from the channels in which it now circulates. Where are the township funds now? In the
              hands of the friends and neighbors of the trustee. I have no doubt that the qualified
              public officers should have charge of the public funds. - If you think the bank men
              can't dodge the law in cases of this kind, I think they can and would, and I cannot
              but believe that the effect of this bill would be injurious to the people.</p>
            <p>Mr. GIFFORD now demanded the previous question, and there was a second: whereupon the
              main question was forced, and the bill was rejectedyeas 27, nays 58.For the votesee

          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the special order - being the favorable report of the
            Committee on Temperance, submitted this morning on the bill [H. R. 327] to regulate the
            sale of intoxicating liquors, etc.</p>
          <p>And thereupon - </p>
          <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN said: Mr. President : If this bill were what it ought to be, a bill to
            prevent and to punish drunkenness and intoxication, no Senator on this floor could vote
            more cheerfully for it than I would do, because no man can hate intoxication and
            drunkenness more than I do, and all laws and measures for preventing and punishing the
            same will always find my hearty support. But this bill now pending before the Senate is
            not such a bill, it is wrong in its start, it overrides its aim, therefore it will not
            only help nothing but it will make the evil worse. Our present law, if enforced, would
            be good and strong enough, but if this law is not enforced or cannot be enforced, what
            kind of guarantee can you have for enforcement of a very much stronger one? We would do
            better to try to find the reasons why the present law is not enforced, instead of
            proceeding with hasty legislation. The fault does not lie with the law but with its
            enforcement and if this bill should become a law, you will make the same experience.</p>
          <p>In looking over this bill, the question arose in my mind: is the sale of intoxicating
            liquors, that is to say: beer, wine and alcoholic liquors a lawful business or not? If
            it is a lawful business, deal with it as with other lawful business; if not, say it at
            once and prohibit it entirely; but do not say it is true, it is not a lawful business,
            but we will close our eyes and allow it under such and such restrictions. That would not
            do. But then go a step further and prohibit the sale of such commodities, not only by
            retail but also by wholesale, that is to say: close the breweries and distilleries and
            establishments for manufacturing wine, as it would be entirely inconsistent to prohibit
            one man from selling five cents worth and allow another man to sell five dollars worth
            of the same merchandise. That would mean, in other that the law should not apply to tin
            who can afford to invest so much money at once, but only to the man who is not able to
            do so, and hence it would be not only inconsistent but the worst kind of class
            legislation. But if you will go on as I have indicated, do so, we shall see the result
            soon enough. But I hope then for one thing. It is well known that our government derives
            a large portion of his revenues and income from the breweries and distilleries, and I
            hope, the same men, who are so anxious now, to see those establishments closed, will
            hereafter, when they will have reached their aim, be patriots <pb n="499"
              xml:id="VAA8558-14-499"/> enough, to put their hands into their own pockets and pay so
            much out of their own money as is necessary to cover the deficit in the treasury.</p>
          <p>It is true, Mr. President, that this bill has a provision inflicting a penalty upon
            drunken men; it fines them the enormous (?) sum of five dollars, not one cent less. But
            this provision is entirely overshadowed by the main feature of the bill, the prosecution
            of the saloon keepers, whose fines run up to twenty-five, fifty and one hundred dollars,
            and in looking over this bill you would be inclined to forget that it takes two men to
            make a bargain, and to believe that it takes but one : the saloon keeper. The bill reads
            as if from the same moment, when a man steps in, the saloon keeper had no other idea, no
            other purpose, than to make that man intoxicated, and as if from that same moment that
            man had lost entirely his free will, his control over himself and was merely a tool in
            the hands of the saloon keepers.</p>
          <p>Now, Mr. President, I say, if a saloon keeper goes on with that purpose, to make a man
            intoxicated; if he induces him to drink, although he sees, that it would not be safe for
            the man to drink more; if he insists upon him to drink notwithstanding the man refuses
            it; if he sells liquor to a man already intoxicated - I say let him be fined not five
            dollars, nor fifty dollars but at least five hundred dollars, and if possible five
            thousand dollars; because he has made a man, God's noblest creature, a dog and a hog.
            But, Mr. President, if a man behaves himself in a saloon, is decent and sober, you
            cannot make the saloon keeper responsible for the damage and mischief the man may do,
            after he has gone out. I am a practical man and I can give or get a practical
            illustration, I like to take it. What would a dealer in hardware say, if he should be
            held responsible for all mischief and damages a man does with a revolver he has bought
            in his store? We have two distinguished Senators here on this floor, both of them
            engaged in hardware business. I submit the question to them. I presume they will say: we
            would never sell to a man who would state that he intended to kill his neighbor or do
            harm otherwise, and that is precisely the same that I expect the saloon keepers to do,
            not less and not more.</p>
          <p>I know, Mr. President, that many Senators do not agree with me herein: they believe
            that this bill strikes the root of the evil and that a man will give up his bad habits
            if he cannot go in a saloon and drink there. I do not believe so. I undertake to say,
            that the worst class of drunkards do not consist of such men, who go in a saloon and
            drink openly but of such men, who swallow their drinks behind the door and have their
            whisky jugs under their bedsteads, as a man who sins openly, gives more hope of reform,
            as a man who has his ways in the dark. And you will increase the number of drunkards by
            this bill. The man who wants to drink, will find means and ways enough to provide
            himself with his beverage, nothing in this bill prohibits him from it, he may take it
            home or to his friends and drink there and with them, and a great many who would be
            ashamed now to appear intoxicated at public places will loose his restraint. I refer to
            Henry Wilson, elected Vice President of the United States, who has stated that he has
            seen more drunkards in the State of Massachusetts during one week, than in Europe during
            six months. And Henry Wilson is a strong temperance man himself and they have a very
            strong temperance law in the State of Massachusetts. Temperance is a virtue growing up
            in the heart of the man and I do not believe in making men virtuous by law. That means
            expelling the black devil by the white devil and the white devil is tenfold more
            dangerous and worse than the black devil, because he is a hypocrite.</p>
          <p>That is it, Mr. President, what I understood by saying, that this bill takes the wrong
            start and I shall not detain the Senate with a long explanation how far the several
            sections go in this wrong direction. Only for giving an illustration I will allude to
            section two, compelling a man, who intends to open or keep a saloon, to make himself
            year for year a bore in the whole election precinct; and to section six, compelling a
            saloon keeper to keep a list of all drunkards, not only in his neighborhood, but in the
            whole State of Indiana; because, as the bill reads, a saloon keeper here in the city of
            Indianapolis may be prosecuted for having sold a drink to a man from New Albany or
            Valparaiso, a stranger to him and to all appearance sober, because it can be proved that
            the man is "in the habit of getting intoxicated" at his place. You must not say to me:
            oh, the law would not be enforced in such a way; I belong to the old school, or if you
            prefer it, to the old foggies, believing that a law, so long as it exists, must be
            enforced to the very letter. I am as a legislator afraid of nothing so much as of laws,
            inforced to-day and neglected to-morrow, so as the interpretation or the good or bad
            will of the officers or the expediency may require it for the special case; the people
            will then not know what is law or not; they will very soon loose the respect for the
            law, and the law, which ought to stand firm as a granite rock, will be trampled as dust
            under the feet.</p>
          <p>With the indulgence of the Senate, I have only a few words more to say in relation to
            two other provisions of this bill. My first <pb n="500" xml:id="VAA8558-14-500"/> point
            is : can this bill be sustained before the courts? I refer to section eight forbidding a
            saloon keeper, to have his business place open before six o'clock and after nine o'clock
            p. m. In Europe, where it is not considered as a crime, to take a glass of beer or wine,
            all such efforts to fix a "police hour" as it is called, have themselves proved always
            as a failure, except in certain localities for certain reasons. It is true we are used
            to look somewhat with contempt upon the States on the other side of the Ocean, the
            "police States," as they are called, but such a restriction of personal freedom as
            proposed in this bill is entirely unheard of even in these "police States." But I ask
            the question: has the State a right to compel me to open or to close my business place
            at a certain hour ? If I wish to open my office at three o'clock a. m., the State has no
            right to prohit it, and if I prefer to keep it open until midnight, it is my own
            pleasure and it is not in the provice of the State to interfere with it, provided that I
            do not disturb the public peace and order. If this bill made such a discrimination, if
            it provided for immediately vacating all saloons, where the rest of the neighbors is
            disturbed by roaring and crying, I would not make the slightest objection, but this bill
            says nothing of it, but inflicts a penalty upon opening and closing business places, in
            my opinion precisely with the same right with which it could inflict a penalty upon me
            for refusing to take my breakfast before eight o'clock a.m., and my supper after eight
            p. m. Can such a provision be sustained before any court ? I am doubtful.</p>
          <p>And here is another point. I am not a lawyer, but so far as I know, our law provides
            that in all cases of indictment the facts must be stated. If however, Senators will look
            on section seventeen, they will find that "in all cases of prosecution by indictment or
            otherwise, it shall not be necessary to state the kind of liquor sold, or to describe
            the place where sold, and that it shall not be necessary to state the names of the
            person to whom sold." What will such an indictment be worth before the courts? Each
            lawyer will defeat it at once. But it looks to me, as if the framer of this bill had
            assumed the right and privilege to change the laws of the State and to make new ones in
            behalf of his temperance bill.</p>
          <p>That is what I understood in saying, that this bill overrides its aim, but not only in
            this respect, it goes a good deal further and is so anxious to prevent drunkenness, that
            it awards a premium for drunkenness. That is not an improper bad joke. Look on section
            eight: "Any person or persons, who shall by the sale of intoxicating liquors with or
            without permit, cause the intoxication in whole or in part, of any other person shall be
            liable for and be compelled to pay a reasonable compensation to any person, who may take
            charge and provide for such intoxicated persons for every day, he or she is cared for."
            And then take with this, section twelve, which reads as follows: "Every husband, wife,
            child, parent, or guardian, or other person who shall be injured in person, or property
            or means of support, by any intoxicated person or, in consequence of the intoxication,
            habitual or otherwise of any person, shall have a right of action in his or her name,
            severally or jointly against any person or persons who shall, by selling, bartering or
            giving away intoxicating liquors, have caused the intoxication in whole or it, part of
            such person," and in looking over the balance of the section, you will find, that also
            the proprietor of the house, in which the saloon is kept, will be held liable for
            damages, even if he is not the owner of the saloon.</p>
          <p>Now, Mr. President, I say that means to award a premium for drunkenness. How will this
            section work? You may be sure the faithful wife, mourning in her heart over and
            suffering under the terrible calamity of having a drunken husband; the loving child,
            afflicted with sorrow over the unfortunate father; the true friend, sorry over his
            friends departure from the paths of righteousness they will spurn with scorn and
            contempt the idea of taking money for caring for her husband, his father, and friend,
            and to sue another man, for a "reasonable compensation" to be recovered by disgracing
            her husband, his father, or friend. But you will find wives, children, and friends, no
            better than the drunkard himself, who will come up and take advantage of this law, they
            will be very glad to see the old man intoxicated day for day, because by suiting other
            parties and extorting money from him, they can make their living better and more easily
            than by working, and the drunkard will heartily consent to it. He may stay at home and
            with the money, his good wife, and his dear children, and his beloved friends have
            extorted from the saloon keeper he shall send them out and cause them to buy one jug of
            whisky after another, they will have their jolly time at home, and after the money shall
            be exhausted, they shall play the same game anew. He shall go to a saloon, take a drink,
            break a couple of cups or glasses, abuse his wife with whom he made the proper agreement
            before, and she will go and with sections eight and twelve in her hands she will sue the
            man in whose saloon the man has taken a drink and thereby get money enough to spend some
            weeks more in idleness.</p>
          <p>Do Senators call this reform? Means that prevent drunkenness? Then, indeed, they are
            satisfied with very small, success? Or do they doubt my word? Then I refer to what <pb
              n="501" xml:id="VAA8558-14-501"/> has happened in the cities of Toledo and Columbus,
            Ohio, when the Adair law, of which the present bill is a copy, but in many points a very
            much stronger one, was in full blast there.</p>
          <p>But I call the attention of Senators to the fact, that yesterdays paper announced that
            the courts at Columbus, Ohio, have declared the Adair law unconstitutional, therefore
            null and void. What can be hoped for this bill? In the same provisions, the decision of
            the court referred to, the Adair law and this bill, the Constitution of the State of
            Ohio and the Constitution of the State of Indiana agree to the very letter. Is it
            necessary for us to increase the number of laws passed by the legislature and declared
            null and void by the courts? We have enough of them ; I refer to the fate the election
            law of 1869, and the fee and salary bill of 1871 have had before the Supreme Court of
            the State, and I believe that the conflict between the Legislative and the Judiciary
            department of the State has hurt the conscience of the people in such a way that we
            should beware of further steps in that direction.</p>
          <p>But, Mr. President, I forgot that here is one section in this bill, perhaps the worst
            of all, a section hurting and wounding, in my opinion, the tenderest and most sacred
            feelings of the human heart. I allude to section thirteen, proposed as an amendment in
            the other House and passed. I said before: the faithful wife, the loving child, the true
            friend, would not come up trying to get money by exposing her husband's, his father's,
            or friend's shameful conduct. But this bill will compell them to do so : if they fail or
            refuse to do it, the township trustee will do it.</p>
          <p>Mr. President, think of it! Think of the wife, suffering under the dreadful calamity to
            have a drunkard for a husband, anxious to hide his shame before the world, but lying
            upon her knees before her God, beseeching him for help for her husband, that he -may be
            converted, for strength for herself, that she may be able to bear her heavy burden, for
            wisdom that she may lead him back to the path of virtue - and meanwhile the township
            trustee goes up to the court house and blows her husband's shameful conduct all over the
            town. And for what? For getting money for the township from another man! Will that
            prevent drunkenness ? Think of the child, imploring God for help, that it may not
            forget, that the unfortunate man is its father, for strength from above, that it maybe
            able to fulfill its duties to him and so more the less the man deserves it - and
            meanwhile the township trustee goes up to the court house and makes its father's name a
            stench before the whole world. And for what ? For getting money for the township from
            another man! Will that prevent drunkenness?</p>
          <p>Mr. President, I beg your pardon, but I cannot help feeling excited when I think of it,
            and if I were the unfortunate son of such an unfortunate father and the township trustee
            would go up and expose my father's shame in open court - God knows I cannot say what I
            would do. My blood has curdled in my veins when I saw that section and I undertake to
            say, that it is a burning shame. I do not know who has put it in, it makes no difference
            and is the same to me; but if he were here, I would dare to say to him, face to face,
            that he has not a spark of human feeling in his heart, more, not a drop of human blood
            in his veins.</p>
          <p>Mr. President, I can but repeat what I said before : If this bill were really a bill to
            prevent and to punish drunkenness and intoxication, no Senator could vote for it more
            cheerfuly than I would do. But it is precisely the contrary to it. I hope that it will
            be amended so that I may be able to support it; but I cannot and shall not vote for it
            in its present shape.</p>
          <p>The report of the <orgName>Committee on Temperance</orgName>, recommending the passage
            of the bill, was then read.Mr. DAGGY moved that the report be concurred in.</p>
          <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Lawrence moved to commit the bill to the <orgName>Committee on the
              Judicary.</orgName> He said he did not make the motion in a spirit of opposition to
            the bill, and did not wish to be understood as opposing the bill by making the motion.
            He was probably as much a friend to the cause of temperance as any Senator on the floor.
            He would go as far to secure the passage of a just law for the suppression of
            intemperance as any Senator. He believed, however, that there were some features in this
            bill that would not stand the tests in the courts: that if the bill was passed in its
            present shape, it would fail in the courts, and instead of having a law for the
            suppression of intemperance we will be left without any law upon that subject. The
            temperance people of the State of Indiana ask this Legislature for a law that can and
            will be enforced by the courts, and he would undertake to say that this was not, and
            would not be such a law. This bill as he understood had not been examined by the
              <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> of either House. It is a very important bill
            and should receive the strictest and most careful examination at the hands of the best
            lawyers of this body, and if it is defective those defects ought to be corrected, so
            that when the bill passed it will be such a one as the temperance people of the State
            demand. This bill is said to be substantially a copy of the Ohio law and the papers
            report that the <pb n="502" xml:id="VAA8558-14-502"/> courts of that State within a few
            days have held that the greater part of that law is unconsiitutional. How far the
            constitutional provisions of the state of Ohio are like the provisions of the
            constitution of Indiana, he was not able to say; but this bill is certainly a proper
            matter for investigation at the hands of the Judiciary Committe of the Senate. There can
            be no doubt but this bill, if it passes will be severelly tested and if it will not
            stand the test of the courts it behooves Senators on this floor to perfect the bill.
            Therefore it was not in a spirit of factious opposition, but is a sincere temperance man
            - as one who would see a good law on the statute books, he made this motion.</p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH moved to amend the motion to refer to the Judiciary Committee by requiring
            them to report the bill back to the Senate day after to-morrow.</p>
          <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY accepted the amendment.</p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH said it seemed to him that the bill would not suffer anything at the hands
            of that committee. A majority of that committe are friends of the bill, and every member
            of the committee is a friend of the cause of temperance, But just now when the courts of
            Ohio are striking down certain sections of her law, of which this bill is, to
            considerable extent a copy, he thought a little delay would be judicious and proper. For
            the reason that the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> may have time to consider and
            investigate this matter he made the motion to amend. Then why is the great necessity for
            ordering this bill engrossed to-day. Two days is a short time if by the delay of two
            days we can protect the people of the State from the evils of intemperance for two
            years. More than that, the bill is very ambigous in many of its most important
            provisions. He would risk his professional reputation on the statement that some of the
            most important sections would be struck down by the Supreme Court in less than six
            months unless it was amended. A bill to restrict the privileges of the whisky men of the
            State must be drawn so carefully that it will stand the most severe test in the courts.
            He had heard it said and he believed it to be true that lawyers are already employed the
            best counsel in the city of Indianapolis, and funds have been raised for the purpose of
            testing the constitutionality of this bill as soon as it is passed. If we have reason to
            believe that that test will be successful, and by two days delay we may avoid it, we
            should certainly do so.</p>
          <p>There are some provisions in this bill that will not meet the expectations of its
            friends. According to section one no restrictions are placed upon the sale of liquor
            except it be drank on the premises where it is sold. It contains nothing regulating or
            prohibiting the sale of liquor by the quart or by the quantity only so that it be
            removed from the premises where it is sold before it is drank. Now he submitted that
            that was not a temperance law. The only prohibition in the bill is that liquor shall not
            be sold for gain. Why not strike out the word "gain" and prohibit the sale of it
            altogether except for medical, mechanical, or sacramental purposes. The Supreme court
            has already decided that the Legislature has no power to prohibit the sale of liquor for
            those purposes and yet this bill proposes to prohibit it. It makes no exception. Judge
            Perkins when on the Supreme Bench, in a decision under the old law where some defect
            existed said the Court would make the proper exceptions but have we any reason to hope
            that any other Court will make an exception under the express language of this bill?
            While the bill is here let us make the legitimate exceptions and prohibit everything
            else. These and some other trivial amendment might be made by the Judiciary Committee he
            thought would make this a practical temperance bill. But in the shape it is if it be
            passed six months will tell upon whom should fall the responsibility of intemperance for
            the State for the next two years.</p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS said he did not think the bill could be amended by the <orgName>Judiciary
              committee</orgName> so as to make it any better. He said it had been claimed that the
            provision requiring the applicant for the permit to sell intoxicating liquors to procure
            a petition signed by a majority of the residents of his township, was unconstitutional.
            If any provision in it was, that probably was. But will the Legislature or the Judiciary
            Committee strike out that clause because they think it is unconstitutional, or will they
            pass the bill with that provision in it and let it go to the courts, and let them decide
            wheth- it is unconstitutional or not? But it is claimed that if the courts strike down
            this law, we will be left without a temperance law at all. He appealed to Senators to
            know if the Courts would not hold that the Legislature has a right to say if a man gets
            drunk and exposes himself in a public place, he shall be guilty of misdemeanor. Have not
            the Legislature a right to say if a man sells whisky to another and makes him drunk and
            he damages his neighbor, that he shall pay the damages? We make everybody else
            responsible. A druggist who sells poison knowingly, a physican who is guilty of
            malpractice, a lawyer who losses his case through negligence or unskillfullness are
            responsible for the damages that result. Why, in God'sname, shall we make an exception
            of the liquor seller? Again it is insisted that liquor may be sold under this bill in
            any quantity, if <pb n="503" xml:id="VAA8558-14-503"/> it is not sold for gain and it is
            proposed to strike out the word "gain." Why refer it to the <orgName>Judiciary
              Commitee</orgName> to do that? If it is thought best let it be done here and now. The
            Senator from Allen and Adams (Mr. Sarnighausen) says that a stranger might come here
            from Valparaiso and buy a drink the liquor man supposing him to be a sober man, and he
            might do some damage and the liquor seller would be responsible. If a citizen of
            Valparaiso comes here and undertakes to do business at a bank, what does he do? He
            procures a voucher as to his identity and character. So, if he wants a drink, let him
            get one of his friends to vouch for him.</p>
          <p>If there is anything that the people of Indiana are demanding to-day, it is the passage
            of this new temperance bill. They are here to demand it, not Republicans, not Democrats,
            but everybody, the better classes in our State. If the bill was submitted to people
            to-day, in his opinion it would pass by a vote of two to one. There are enough
            provisions that are admited to be constitutional to make a good law. Delays are
            dangerous. We do not know what may occur between to-day and day after to-morrow and it
            can do no good to refer the bill. No one has mentioned a single provision that is
            unconstitutional yet. The broad charge is made that it is unconstitutional. The bill has
            passed the House where there are good lawyers, and there are good lawyers in the Senate.
            Let them examine it in open Senate and vote upon it.</p>
          <p>Mr. BROWN said it seemed to him that the friends of the bill had better make haste
            slowly. A careful and prudent course will add greatly to the strength of its support.
            The bill ought to go to the Committe on Judiciary in the first place in order that the
            lawyers of this body may carefuly examine it and report back their opinion as to whether
            it is a valid or invalid law or not. A favorable report from that committee would
            greatly increase the strength of the bill. If the bill approved itself to his judgment
            and conscience as being a bill that could be sustained by the constitution and laws of
            the country he should vote for it gladly because he believed that some substantial
            reform should be had in reference to the subject of temperance. But it seemed to him
            that the bill might be improved. But whether valid or not; he trusted it would have
            every opportunity to bring to its support the greatest possible strength.</p>
          <p>Another provision might be added that would tend largely to the suppression of the
            drinking of intoxicating liquors as a beverage. Suppose an additional section were
            added, requiring a man that drinks to take out license for the privelege of drinking,
            that he must first go before the Board of Commissioners and get a license, paying for it
            the sum. of twenty-five dollars. It seemed to him that such a provision would go further
            towards the suppression of intemperance than anything else. Whether it was a practicable
            thing or not he did not know. But he did desire that some stringent measure, one that
            commended itself to the judgment of intelligent sensible people, one that may stand in
            the courts, should be passed that would have a tendency to abolish from, the State the
            disgraceful booths and places that are bringing dishonor and corruption upon the people.
            He thought the bill should be amended in another respect. There should be a provision in
            it that would forbid the employment of minors by men who are engaged in this dangerous
            and illicit business.</p>
          <p>Mr. STEELE said he was in favor of the bill as it was. He did not know of any good that
            could come to the bill, nor did he think it would acquire any additional force by being
            referred to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>. It seemed strange to him that
            the amendments proposed had not been matured before, so that the friends of the bill
            might know just what was desired. It has been charged that the bill is unconstitutional,
            but there has been no attempt to point out what particular section is unconstitutional,
            and there is no sufficient reason given why it should be referred to the
              <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>. It is said that Ohio, in the last few
            days, just before the time that we are to take a step in the direction of temperance, as
            we think - it is claimed by some - and nobody appears to I know who, in some paper that
            is not produced here at all, that perhaps some court in Ohio has made or is about to
            make, has struck down, or is about to strike down, the provisions of the Ohio law. Is
            that a sufficient reason why we should wait here in legislation until we know what Ohio
            has done? If this bill is referred to a committee, in all human probability it would be
            the last of what is called the temperance law at this session of the Legislature. He was
            willing to take the risk, to say to the people that they had the bill printed for a
            month or two and have poured in their demands in the shape of petitions by thousands and
            tens of thousands of names, and that we have done that which they demanded at our hands.
            He wanted Senators to face the music, to come up to the demands that the people have
            made and pass this bill as it came from the House of Representatives. If the bill should
            be declared unconstitutional by the courts, we shall have learned that by the next
            session when its defects will have been pointed out, and can then be remedied.</p>
          <p>Mr. DAGGY did not think it necesserys a <pb n="504" xml:id="VAA8558-14-504"/> far as
            the constitutional question is concerned, to refer the bill to the <orgName>Judiciary
              Committee</orgName>. For the purpose of anticipating objections, and leaving no doubt
            of the validity of the bill in its present form, he stated that the bill, in all its
            provisions, has been submitted to men of the best legal talent of the State of all
            parties, and they have declared that in their opinions it is constitutional.</p>
          <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence (interposing.) I would like to ask the names of some of these
            lawyers who have given their opinion favorable to the constitutionality of this
            bill.</p>
          <p>Mr. DAGGY. If the gentleman will call upon me at my room I will inform him. I don't
            think it proper to proclaim their names here. As far as its constitutionality is
            concerned a reference to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> would not, in his
            opinion, give it any additional force or character. Of the demands of the people of the
            State for a better law on the subject of temperance there can be no doubt. The force and
            effect of this bill has been discussed all over the State. The people know what it is,
            and an almost unanimous voice from every county by the newspapers as well as by
            petition; is in favor of this bill as it now stands; therefore he opposed the motion to
            refer and favored the passage of the bill as it came from the House of Representatives.
            He feared a reference to the committee might result in an amendment, which would send it
            back to the House and it might be kept passing back and forth and so defeated. It seems
            a little strange that just as they were about to act on this bill, from some remote
            corner in Ohio, from some obscure paper, a report comes, that is copied into the papers
            here, that some obscure court has declared some of the provisions of the Ohio law
            unconstitutional. It don't pretend to point out the objection to the law, and is
            evidently thrown in for the purpose of operating against the passage of the bill. There
            may be some wholesome amendments made. The amendment suggested by the Senator from
            Johnson, [Mr. Brown,] that minors shall not be employed in this dangerous business, is a
            good one, but we have already passed a bill embracing that provision.</p>
          <p>Mr. SLATER (in his seat.) I think not.</p>
          <p>Mr. DAGGY. At all events the sense of the Senate has been taken on that, and I am in
            favor of taking a vote on this bill and passing it as it comes from the House of
            Representatives.</p>
          <p>Mr. BOONE. I am in favor of the reference proposed. The fact that this, bill has been
            delayed to this late hour in the session is not the fault of the enemies of the measure,
            for it has been in the hands of its friends. It is extraordinary in the history of
            legislation for gentlemen to argue that a proposition of this character ought to pass
            because legal gentlemen outside of this body declare it is constitutional. In
            legislative business we select a <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName> to which
            provisions involving a question likely to be litigated should be submitted. And it is
            extraordinary in the history of legislation that a bill of this character should be
            passed without reference to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> in either branch
            of the Legislature. Of course the question of constitutionality I do not propose to
            discuss. In my judgment many provisions in the bill are defective, but whether the
            Committee on the Judiciary would correct them or not I am not able to say.</p>
          <p>Gentlemen insist that to recommit would delay action of the Senate to the extent of the
            final defeat of the bill, but that I am not willing to admit. And I am not willing to
            admit that the Committee of which the gentleman from Grant is chairman, have
            demonstrated by their action that they would pocket this bill and not present it in time
            for the Senate to have an opportunity to act upon it. The known energy of the gentleman
            himself would repel any objection of the kind. It would only delay the bill a few days -
            not longer than day after to-morrow. It is due to the people who are demanding this act
            that the bill should be passed with the application of the rules which surround
            legislation. They demand it with the idea that this body and the other branch of the
            Legislature will discharge their duty so that it may have force and effect. If you pass
            it defective and go home and expect to exculpate yourself, they will inform you that
            they supposed you would have sense enough to put it through the forms of
            legislation.</p>
          <p>I think it important that this bill should be submitted to the <orgName>Judiciary
              Committee</orgName> and even if they do not amend it, it will go before the country
            with a better face than now. Suppose my constituents were to ask me why this bill was
            not referred to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> as other bills of less
            importance are? I could give no valid answer.</p>
          <p>Mr. HOUGH. It looks to me as though this motion was uncalled for. The distinguished
            chairman of the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, [Mr. Steele,] if we are to judge
            from what he has said, has failed to discover anything that would prompt him to suggest
            in that Committee an amendment that would relieve it from its unconstitutional
            character. The distinguished member of the same Committee from Putnum [Mr. Daggy] has
            also failed to make any such discovery; and it seems that these two gentlemen could do
            nothing to shape this bill differently from what it now is if it were referred to their
            Committee, for they have failed to point out <pb n="505" xml:id="VAA8558-14-505"/> one
            single element in the bill that is uncon-constitutional. The distinguished gentleman
            from Lawrence [Mr. Friedley] while suggesting that in his opinion there are provisions
            in the bill unconstitutional has failed to enlighten the Senate of them. Why can these
            gentlemen not inform the Senate wherein exists the necessity of referring this bill to
            the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>. The people are satisfied with the provisions
            of this bill as far as heard from. Some distinguished members of the bar have been
            instrumental in getting up this bill, and I presume they have taken the opinion of some
            of the best legal talent in the State of Indiana on its constitutionality. This bill has
            passed the House of Representatives and it seems to me that unless some Senator is able
            to point out some unconstitutional provision, we have a right to infer there is no such
            provision in it and the Senate would stullify itself by making such a reference. Since
            this discussion commenced the county of Hancock - supposed to be in favor of as much
            whisky as any other - a county I represent - sends up a petition of over three hundred
            names asking that this bill be passed without the crossing of a "t" or the dotting of a
            "i." Then why refer this bill if not with a desire to stifle it? I hope the Senate will
            not adjourn without passing this bill to the engrossment. I ask that this petition may
            be received now. </p>
          <p>Mr. DITTEMORE moved ineffectually that the Senate adjourn.</p>
          <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of lawrence said. Among all the distinguished Senators who have spoken
            against the reference of this bill to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> no
            valid reason had been given why the bill should not be so referred. Whenever a bill is
            presented involving questions of constitutional law or other legal questions, it is the
            invariable custom of the Senate to refer it to the Judiciary Committee. Here is a bill
            involving some of the most important legal propositions that can come before the Senate,
            and yet we are told that there is something about this bill that prevents it from
            following the ordinary course of other bills involving important legal propositions. Why
            is it that they fear to allow this bill to be submitted to the scrutity of the
              <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> Is there something in it that willnot bear
            investigation? Are they asking Senators to pass a bill that they are fearful
            investigation will in some way cripple? If there are provisions in the bill are doubtful
            constitutionality,if there are provisions in this bill about which gentlemen have doubts
            why should they not be considered by the proper committee? Why should you fearto allow
            this bill to go as other bills go to the Judiciary Committee and be fairly and honestly
            investigated, by gentlemen composing that commttee? The people have petitioned for the
            passage of a temperance bill, but not of one of doubtful constitutionality, and it is
            the duty of the Senator to pass a valid bill and one that can be enforced.</p>
          <p>Here is the Senator who is chairman of that <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> [Mr.
            Steele] and here is the distinguished Senator from Putnam [Mr. Daggy] who is a member of
            the same committee, and there are other Senators who are friends of this bill upon that
            committee and a motion is made not that the committee shall report the bill back some
            day next week, but the motion is that they shall examine it and report day after
            tomorrow and yet these distinguished men say if that is done it endangers the passage of
            the bill. It does not as far as time is concerned then how does it damge the prospects?
            They must fear that there is something in the bill that will not bear investigation.</p>
          <p>Mr. HOUGH (interposing.) Will the Senator suggest what is?</p>
          <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence. Will the Senator suggest the great fears for this bill to go
            to the Judiciary Committee? I want to call attention to one proposition. They say the
            people by thousands and ten of thousands are petitioning the Legislature for a
            temperance law. It is true that a great number of people are petitioning this General
            Assembly in favor of a law to suppress intemperance, and I am as ready to turn a
            listening ear to that voice as any Senator but the people have not petitioned for the
            enactment of a law of doubtful constitutionality.</p>
          <p>If you examine these petitions you will find that every one of them nearly have
            language like this: praying for the enactment of a law for the suppression of
            intemperance. Now when they are petitioning for a law that will suppress this evil -
            when these people are asking for bread these distinguished gentlemen would give them a
            stone. I am a better temperance man than that. I say there are times enough in the next
            fifteen days of this session to perfect a temperence bill, and I say woe to the Senator
            who by indecent haste and a disregard for the ordinary rules of legislation forces upon
            the statute books a law which will not meet the requirements of the people. I would
            rather cast my lot with those who stand up and contend for a bill carefully guarded,
            investigated and matured and when such a bill is presented to this Senate I am ready and
            willing to vote for it. Now let us not make this bill an exception to the general rule.
            Let us not say there is something in this bill that requires us to turn our backs upon
            the ordinary rules that govern legislation. Let us go to work <pb n="506"
              xml:id="VAA8558-14-506"/> and perfect this bill and then I will help to | pass it.</p>
          <p>Mr. SLATER demanded the previous question on the motion to recommit.</p>
          <p>The Senate refused to second the demand.</p>
          <p>Mr. STEELE. I am always pleased to hear the eloquent voice of the Senator from Lawrence
            [Mr. Friedley] who is always careful that all measures passed by the Senate shall be
            nicely scrutenized: and I am always willing to give way to such demands when I see a
            reason for the faith he professes; but when I see a man take a position in regard to
            anything and fail to give a reason for the faith that is within him, I always begin to
            doubt that there is something wrong in the thing itself. The gentleman says we should be
            careful not to act hastily in this matter that we should send it to the Judiciary
            Committee that the country expects it; yet he has had the floor twice and he has failed
            to point out one single objection. It is unconstitutional in his judgment. If that be
            the fact may we not claim that the gentleman from Lawrence is with us for he is unable
            to point out any one single provision in thss bill which he thinks would be
            unconstitutional.</p>
          <p>And I have always had the greatest respect for the Senator from Boone [Mr. Boone.] I
            know him to be a candid man and a good lawyer, and I know him to be a careful man in all
            that he does. If there are any unconstitutional provisions in this bill there is no
            member, perhaps, of this Senate who would be more likely to find it out and be able to
            point it out to the Senate than the Senator from Boone, yet he, like the Senator from
            Lawrence, sits down quietly, after expressing his doubts about the constitutionality of
            some of the provisions of this bill, without attempting to point out any. Then may we
            not conclude that the Senator from Boone, as well as the Senator from Lawrence, is with
            us in being unable to point out to the Senate a single unconstitutional provision in the
            bill?</p>
          <p>Mr. BOONE (interposing.) I desire to say that I do not think it necessary to discuss
            the merits of the bill on a mere proposition to recommit; but I have got them down, and,
            like the Senator from Putnam, will read them to him at my room - or here.</p>
          <p>Mr. STEELE. It is right now, when it is proposed to take this bill from the Senate and
            hand it over to a committee - hand it over to a committee for what? For the purpose of
            correcting some errors that are not pointed out. I can see no reason in that. Gentlemen
            are offering no reason to the Senate why it should be done at all.</p>
          <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence. I would ask if it has been customary heretofore when a motion
            is made to refer a bill to the Judiciary or any other Committee, to discuss its merits
            simply as a motion to refer? I have refrained from discussing the merits of this bill
            and confined myself to the reasons why it should take the ordinary course. It is hardly
            fair to say that a man cannot find an objection to a bill when he has only spoken of it
            on a motion to refer.</p>
          <p>Mr. STEELE. It is proposed to send this bill to a Committee from the fact that
            gentlemen say there are provisions in it of doubtful constitutionality, and yet, I say,
            they utterly fail to point out a section, a line or a word in this bill, and venture
            their reputa- as lawyers that it is unconstitutional. Why is it kept back? Is it
            customary when a bill comes before the Senate from a Committee to refer it to another
            Committee without a reason why? Is it sent that there probably may be errors found? Why
            not say to the Senate that such and such unconstitutional provisions are in the bill; or
            such and such doubtful declarations are in the bill that the courts will not enforce ?
            Why not point them out ? Without that I assert again there is no good reason for so
            committing the bill.</p>
          <p>Is it usual to refer every bill to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> ? This
            bill on Temperance has been referred to the <orgName>Temperance Committee</orgName> and
            that Committee has referred it back and find no objection to it. Yet gentlemen say there
            are probably unconstitutional provisions in it; - that there are provisions
            objectionable in it: and still they fail to point out one single one. Is it not strange?
            Yet they say they are friends of temperance. I never impugn the motive of gentlemen, but
            I say it is fair that these gentleman who raise constitutional objections to this bill
            should point them out to the Senate so we may know why they are proposing to send it
            back to another Committee. Is it customary to send a bill back to a Committee without
            stating the reasons why? No sir, when you refer it back to a Committee you say to the
            Senate we give these reasons why it should be sent back that such a section or line is
            unconstitutional or such as should not be in the bill.</p>
          <p>The gentleman from Johnson [Mr. Brown] referred to a matter which he thought should be
            added as an additional section, and I agree with the gentleman from Jackson, as I am
            always glad to do, that there should be such a law as he speaks of; but there is happily
            a bill on the third reading in this House to prevent the very evil he speaks of.</p>
          <p>Mr. BROWN (interposing.) If that bill is engrafted upon this is there not a greater
            probability of this one being passed?</p>
          <p>Mr. STEELE. I say no. A man who would vote against this bill on that account <pb
              n="507" xml:id="VAA8558-14-507"/> will vote against it anyhow. That is my
            judgment.</p>
          <p>Mr. HALL moved that the motion to refer the bill to the <orgName>Committee on the
              Judiciary</orgName> be laid on the table.</p>
          <p>The motion was agreed to yeas 26 nays 22 - see page 181.</p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN moved to amend section six and seventeen so as to provide that any per- who
              shall "knowingly," sell any liquor to a minor or a person who is in the habit of
              getting intoxicated shall be subject to the penalties provided. He said that guilty
              intent was the very essence of crime. The bill proposes to license a men to sell
              liquor. Surely men thus licensed should not be punished unless they knowingly violate
              the provisions of the bill. I do not think it fair, said he, for the Legislature to
              legitimatize a business that is not sustained or if sustained by common law it is by
              sufferance and not because it approves itself to the conscience and judgement of the
              mind of the people,- and then provide for the preventment of a party who may
              ignorantly violate some of the provisions of the act.</p>
            <p>Now the guilty intention is the gist of the offense - so regarded by both by the
              criminal code of this country, and we are led to believe that the guilty intention is
              to be the criterian by which the Almighty determines whether he will pour judgment of
              conviction upon a soul or not. I suppose there never was a man convicted of murder
              unless the guilty intention was proven. I suppose a man was never convicted of larceny
              unless a guilty knowledge or intention was proven: or of purjury, or of any other
              crime unless it was proven the party had knowledge of a guilty. The intention involved
              in it is nec-cessary to make it a crime.</p>
            <p>Suppose some sleek well dressed; well behaved, well appearing man, with the cut of
              his jib in the appropriate height of fashion should step in to some tippling house,
              the existence of which is provided for in this bill and suppose he calls for a glass
              of liquor. There would be nothing in his appearance that would put a man upon his
              guard; and yet it may be the fellow is in the habit of getting drunk almost daily if
              not weekly or monthly yet the man allowed to carry on this kind of business if he
              sells to such a person whose apperance repelled the idea that he was in the habit of
              becoming intoxicated,he would be liable to the criminal code. I say there is no more
              sense or reason no more law or justice, no more right or reason for saying a man you
              license in this business shall be made criminal for selling to a party who is in the
              habit of getting drunk without his knowing of the habit, than there is in punishing a
              man for passing a counterfeit bill without his knowing it to be counterfeit. I have
              not submitted this amendment for the purpose of making captious opposition. Gentlemen
              may learn that there are some Senators here who desire to put this bill in a shape
              that a Democratic Supreme Court or any other Supreme Court may not tear it down.</p>
            <p>Mr. HUBBARD thought the amendment was unnecessary. A law is now is now in force
              prohibiting the sale of liquors to minors which does not contain the word "knowingly"
              but the Supreme Court has decided the liquor seller was not liable unless guilty
              intent or negligence were shown. It puts the party on dilligent inquiry and if
              honestly deceived by the appearance of a person they have no reason to suspect was
              false, the statement of criminal intent falls in the case. The only effect this
              amendment has would be to send the bill back to the House of Representatives.</p>

            <p>Pending the roll-call - </p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said;
              I cannot vote to lay this amendment on the table. It strikes me as most extraordinary
              that we are preparing to pass a bill declaring certain acts misdemeanors and assessing
              against the parties found guilty of those acts the heaviest penalties, with an
              emergency clause attached. Nothing like it has been done in the history of legislation
              in the State of Indiana. If this measure is right if it appeals to the judgment and
              the consciences of men, as we are told I want to know if we must resort to subterfuge
              and expedients unknown to ordinary legislation in order to accomplish that which
              gentlemen tell us is right. I can not vote to lay the amendment on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. RHODES, when his name was called in explanation of his vote, said: If I
              understand the provisions of this bill correctly persons now engaged in the traffic
              and having licenses are continued until their licenses expire. No person will be
              allowed to sell under the operations of this act until he complies with it; so there
              will be no hardships if the emergency clause is left in. I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. RINGO, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said : I look upon
              every move that is made to amend this bill as a move to defeat it. That is my
              impression and I think it is well founded too. I wish it were possible for this
              respectable audience now present to have the privilege of seeing the large number of
              petitions laying in that post office room, asking the Senate to pass this bill in the
              shape it now is. I must vote "aye" for my constituents and for myself.</p>
            <p>When the roll call was completed - </p>
            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the vote as above.</p>
            <p>So the motion to strike out the emergency clause was laid on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. BOONE moved to amend section nine by striking out that clause which requires
              persons convicted of drunkenness to designate the person from whom they obtained
              liquor on penalty of imprisonment in case of refusal. Suppose they obtain it out of
              the State, as they will do; or suppose they come into the State intoxicated having
              obtained the liquor in Louisville, or Cincinnati, or elsewhere outside of the State.
              It is not even required that he may name the place, but he must designate the person.
              It means simply to point out the person. They may not know the street and therefore it
              is wholly unimportant. And suppose persons to be traveling and taken on the line of
              travel, rather than be imprisoned they would give the name of a party, perhaps,
              untruthfully. The fifteenth section is to be considered in connection with the ninth
              section.</p>
            <p>Mr. HUBBARD moved to lay the amendment on the table.</p>
            <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas 26, nays 20.</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence, moved to amend section one by striking out the word "gain."
              He said: it is claimed that this is a bill to suppress tippling houses, and yet, under
              this section a man might establish a tippling house provided he does not sell liquor
              for gain. He might sell nails, or any other articles, and give away the whisky. I
              believe every one will concede that the word "gain" ought to be stricken out.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE moved to lay the amendment on the table.</p>
            <p>It was so ordered by yeas 27, nays 19.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN moved to strike out section eighteen, - [see page 182]which provides that
              in prosecutions under the act it shall not be necessary to state the kind of liquor,
              the place where nor the person to whom sold. He said the provision violates all the
              principles of criminal pleeding and the constitution of the State, which requires that
              an indictment shall contain all the facts upon which the States predicates an offense.
              He thought an indictment which omitted to state to whom the liquor was sold would be
              bad. as not containing the material facts. This proposes to extend the jurisdiction of
              the class of cases all over the State. If a man sells a glass of whisky in violation
              of this act any court of criminal jurisdiction between the Lakes and the Ohio river
              may take him, apprehend him, try him, and convict him.</p>
            <p>It seems to me, continued Mr. B., that this bill proposes to be put through here not,
              so much because of its merits as for a little bit of a triumph. I shall discharge my
              duty as best I can; I shall seek to strike at what I deem to be wrong and unjust, I
              then leave the responsibility with those with whom I act of saying whether this bill
              shall or shall not become part of the legislation of Indiana ; and by and by when it
              comes tottering down and we shall have free whisky and free Democracy in the country,
              I desire that some of these Senators who are moving to lay on the table continually,
              in the face of what their judgment knows is right, shall look back to to-day when they
              will see that they are fighting men who are making honest efforts to place this bill
              upon a solid foundation where it can stand the assaults of lawyers and judges of
              courts.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE said if this provision were directed to the manner of the proof the
              objection might be valid. But as it refers merely to the statement of the case, he <pb
                n="509" xml:id="VAA8558-14-509"/> thought it had no foundation. The gentleman from
              Jackson [Mr. Brown] insists that something is stated that is wrong. Suppose that is
              true does it militate against the bill at all? If there is something that should be
              declared void by the court it will amount to nothing when it comes to trial one way or
              the other. He moved that the amendment lie on the table.</p>
            <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas 26, nays 21.</p>
            <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM moved to amend the bill so as to prohibit the employment of minors
              in all places where intoxicating liquors are manufactured or sold.</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence. That amendment would do more towards reforming the people
              of Indiana as far as temperance is concerned than any other act we can pass. I am of
              opinion that there are more drunkards made by the employment of children in saloons
              than in any other way. If we are sincere in this work of reform, let us come up to the
              work manfully and let us take these little children out of these places where they are
              acquiring habits that must prove their ruin. If this amendment is right where is the
              man who has not the courage to stand up here and do what is right. I have heard
              Senators boast that thay simply wanted to know the path of duty and they had the
              courage to march straight forward in that path. They will all agree that this
              amendment is right, and I want to see them go , upon the record upon this question. I
              want to test their sincerity. Now gentlemen of the Senate, friends of this bill and of
              the cause of temperance, if you really desire to do society a substantial and lasting
              benefit you have it in your power by engrafting this amendment in this bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS said that he was in favor of the passage of a bill incorporating that
              provision, and one was now pending in the Senate and on its third reading to
              accomplish that very thing. Now, if the bill under consideration is amended it must go
              back to the House, and we are warned that if that occurs there is danger that it may
              be defeated. He moved to lay the amendment on the table.</p>
            <p>It was so ordered by yeas 25, nays 22.</p>
            <p>Mr. SLATER moved to amend the bill, so as to except from the provisions of the bill,
              mint julips, whisky cocktails, sherry cobblers and claret punches.</p>
            <p>Mr. HALL moved the amendment be laid on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE moved to amend that it be rejected.</p>
            <p>Mr. HALL accepted the amendment, and the motion prevailed.</p>
            <p>Mr. HALL moved the previous question on the passage of the bill to the third reading
              on to-morrow.</p>
            <p>The demand was seconded by the following vote:</p>

            <head rend="center">THE BRIBERY QUESTION.</head>

            <p>Mr. WADGE offered a preamble and resolution, setting forth that whereas, a charge had
              been made in a public meeting at the Academy of Music, last Sunday, that money was
              being used to influence Senators in their votes on the bill for the suppression of
              intemperance, and that the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars had been
              already raised for that purpose, and whereas, it is due to the dignity of this body or
              to such of its members as may vote against this bill from conscientious motives,
              therefore a committee of five be appointed to investigate the matter with power to
              send for persons and papers and report at the earliest possible moment.</p>
            <p>Mr. DAGGY said no specific charge had been made against any Senator. It had not even
              been charged that any Senator had received any money, only that a sum had been raised.
              He thought the statement was too vague to be worthy of notice. He therefore moved to
              lay the resolution on the table.</p>
            <p>The motion was rejected by yeas 22, nays 27 - as follows.</p>

            <p>Pending the roll call.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: If I did not
              know the man referred to [Col. John W. Kay] I would vote for the resolutions; but he
              is a zealous advocate of any cause he undertakes and he sometimes allows his
              enthusiasm to get away with him. I am told that the audience was exceedingly large and
              enthusiastic: that the beauty and fashion of Indianapolis were out, and that he,
              taking advantage of it desired of course, to appear to the best possible advantage. He
              could not think of anything else to say; was very earnestly advocating this bill, and
              if a commission of insanity had come around about that time and taken possession of
              him, they would have found him insane and taken him to some asylum. I trust he will
              not be made the subject of a severe investigation committee presided over by the
              Senator from Lake [Mr. Wadge.] I have no doubt he made the statement without
              reflection and is now sorry for what he said, therefore I will I vote to lay the
              resolution on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. DAGGY, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I made the
              motion for the reason that the resolution <pb n="511" xml:id="VAA8558-14-511"/>
              contains no charge against any Senator. If it will charge any Senator by name I am
              ready to pass it. I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. GLESSNER, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: I
              understand this charge has not only been made on this occasion but on several other
              occasions, and I think I have heard it myself, and it goes further than the statement
              in the resolution - that any Senator who shall vote against this bill it would be
              presumptive evidence that he was bought. I think it just and due to the honor and
              integrity of this Senate and to Senators who may vote against this bill, that this
              Committee should be appointed and an investigation had, so that if the charge is
              unfounded Senators may be properly exculpated. On the other hand if it is found that
              any Senator has been improperly influenced he ought to be exposed, so that proper
              action may be taken to expel him from this body. I regard this resolution in a serious
              sense. When a personal charge is made against a Senator or a class of Senators, they
              have always, upon a request therefor, been given a committee of investigation, so they
              may have an opportunity of exculpating themselves. I vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. GOODING, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: For the
              remaining time of this session we have more important business than running down
              rumors started away from this body. The charge is in an indefinite shape. If any man
              will get anything like a tangible charge, I would be in favor of investigating it.Mr.
              GREGG, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: I was at the
              meeting last Sunday and heard the gentleman's [Col. Ray's] remarks, but I do not
              think, in all justice to the gentleman that he made the charge as set out in these
              resolutions. I understood the gentleman in the vehemence of his argument to say that
              he had been informed that there had been money raised for the purpose of using in the
              Senate to procure the defeat of this bill, and that the country would probably hold
              those who voted against the bill guilty on the presumption that those who voted
              against the bill were influenced by this money. The gentleman was extravagent enough
              to say that it would politically kill any Senator who would vote against the bill -
              that the cause of temperance held in its hand the fate of any man. But inasmuch as the
              charge has gone out I will vote for the investigation. I vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. O'BRIEN, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: It seems to
              me it would be premature to order an investigation before the vote on this temperance
              bill, for we do not know who to investigate. Therefore I vote "aye,"</p>
            <p>Mr. ORR, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: If I could for a
              moment believe the report to be true, I would vote for these resolutions. As it is I
              must vote in favor of laying them on the table. I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. SLEETH, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: Whatever may
              have been his [Col. Ray's] statement or the vehemence with which it was uttered, he is
              a gentleman of truth and veracity, and I cannot believe it was not true if he made it.
              I cannot believe that he would stand up before an audience and tell that which was not
              true. I know other legislative bodies have not thought it infringing upon their
              dignity to order investigations into the conduct of their members, and I cannot see
              why an investigation should not be ordered upon this charge. I think it due to this
              body and to the people we represent; therefore I vote "no" on this motion.</p>
            <p>Mr. THOMPSON, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: Col. Ray
              was an excellent man, but having been for a long time overseer of one of the prisons,
              he had grown up with the idea that mankind is generally depraved, and he takes it for
              granted when he sees a man acting in opposition to his sentiments, that he is
              corrupt.</p>
            <p>Mr. WADGE, when his name was called, said: I desire to explain my reasons for
              offering these resolutions. I will read a report of this speech as published in the
              Indiana Journal, and leave it to the Senate if it does not contain a charge of bribery
              against every man in the Senate who may vote against the temperance bill. Mr. W.
              read:</p>
            <p>
              <hi rend="blockquote">"Col. John W. Ray was then called for and came out from behind
                the scene very much as Billy Manning slouches upon the stage at the commencement of
                one of his great acts. He said they had now presented to the Legislature a bill that
                had principle and not expediency for its foundation. There are three common law
                principles in the bill. First, the common law has never recognized the right to sell
                intoxicating liquors as a beverage. No man has ever been able to sell it except
                under a special provision of the statute. And it is a very poor comment on a traffic
                that when the people, through their representatives, are about to place this trade
                on the same ground as that by which every common law trade is tolerated, to see them
                boasting that they have two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to buy a Senate with.
                If he were a member of the Indiana Senate, he would expect every man in Indiana to
                believe that he got part of that money if he voted against this bill. (Applause.) He
                told the legislators present, that when the whisky men boast that they have got the
                money and declare that they intend to use it, they cannot escape the odium of having
                been the recipient of part of that money if they vote against the bill."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I say this means nothing if it does not mean money has been used: and it seems to
              me the Senate cannot overlook a charge of <pb n="512" xml:id="VAA8558-14-512"/> that
              kind and support its dignity as it should.</p>
            <p>I vote "no,"</p>
            <p>When the roll call was finished.</p>
            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the vote as above recorded.</p>
            <p>So the motion to lay on the table was rejected.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. BROWN the resolutions were made a special order for ten and a half
              o'clock to-morrow a. m.</p>

            <head rend="center">THE TEMPERANCE BILL.</head>
            <p>Mr. BEESON moved to suspend the order of business to take up the House temperance
              bill.</p>
            <p>The motion was agreed to - yeas 28, nays 21.</p>
            <p>Mr. SLATER move ineffectually to adjourn.</p>
            <p>Mr. O'BRIEN moved that the bill be read the third time.</p>
            <p>Mr. BOONE moved that the bill be recommitted to the <orgName>Committee on
                Temperance</orgName> with certain instructions - see top of page 188.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN thought the motion ought to prevail. He should like to see in what attitude
              the <orgName>Committee on Temperance</orgName> would place themselves in refusing to
              receive this bill. The bill contains some very strange provisions. His desire was to
              make a law that would stand the test of the severest criticism and investigation. The
              two leading features of the bill are, first, that it requires a majority of the
              citizens of the ward or town to sign the petition of the parties, and the next is that
              it provides that the party selling liquor, shall be liable for consequential damages
              He thought the first of these provisions was constitutional. He thought it would be so
              decided notwithstanding the Supreme Court a good many years ago made a decision rather
              adverse to that. But as to the other provision he ventured the opinion that it was
              illegal and void, and he beleved it would be so determined whenever it was presented.
              He did not believe under the State Constitution, a man could be made more liable in a
              case of that kind than the common law makes him. We have our common law action against
              a whisky seller, if by reason of any improper engagement of his a party sustains
              injury or damage.</p>
            <p>He then referred to the abstract in the <hi rend="sc">JOURNAL</hi> of this morning of
              the dicision made in Ohio recently upon the liquor law of that State, and said that in
              at least two of the points on which an adverse decision had been rendered, that law
              was precisely the same as this bill. The bill he said should be so amended that the
              fact that the liquor was sold in a place rented for that use should make it at least
              prima facie evidence, if not absolute knowledge that the party renting had notice of
              the sale.</p>
            <p>Mr. ORR here rose to a point of order, that Mr. Brown had already spoken five
              minutes, and was cut off from proceeding under the rule recently adopted.</p>
            <p>Mr. DITTEMORE moved that he be allowed to proceed - </p>
            <p>Messrs O'Brien, Hall Orr, and others objected.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN said he made no factious opposition to the bill. The objections he had made
              to the bill were in good faith. He was now willing to leave it to the fnrture to tell
              who are right, he, who desired to strip the bill of its objectionable feature so that
              it will became a valid and existing law, or those who would put it through in a
              defective and objectionable form, on the plea of necessity.</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence, and Mr. Hall and Mr. Brown addressing the chair, [Mr.
              Chapman in the chair] the latter demanding a division of the question. Mr. Hall being
              recognized demanded the previous question.</p>
            <p>The Senate seconded the demand.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN demanded the yeas and nays on the question whether the main question should
              be now put, and the yeas and nays were ordered and being taken resulted as
              follows:</p>

            <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER stated the first question to be on the motion to recommit.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN said that was the first, last and only question before the Senate. The
              motion of Mr. Boone involved several proposed amendments to the bill and he therefore
              demanded a division of the question.</p>
            <p>Mr. HUBBARD made the point of order that it takes a majority of the Senate to order a
              division of the question.</p>
            <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER sustained the point of order on the ground that a demand for a
              division of the question can not be made after the previous question is ordered.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS said the only question is, shall the bill be recommitted with
              instructions? and that question is not divisible.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN appealed from this decision of the chair and said he demanded a division

            <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Lawrence, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said:
              I suppose this is the last attempt that will be made to perfect this bill. It seems to
              me the proposition is a good and a very reasonable one. And that it ought to commend
              itself to the favor of every friend of temperance on this floor. It is one against
              which no substantial objection can be urged. It is simply a proposition to make
              amendments that every one will concede are reasonable in themselves and for the
              purpose of having those amendments properly brought before the Senate the bill is to
              be referred to the Committee on Temperance and placed in the hands of the friends of
              the bill, so that if it is desirable on their part or if it desirable on the part of
              the friends of temperance here to perfect the bill it may be done. They are to say now
              whether they will use that ordinary precaution in framing this most important measure
              or whether by disregarding the ordinary rules of legislation they will rush on and
              drive the people who are asking for a temperance law upon the rock upon which the
              temperance ship in Ohio has foundered. "I plead" he said "in behalf of these people
              who have petitioned this General Assembly for a temperance law and I plead with the
              friends of this bill and I ask them whether they will throw away this last opportunity
              to amend and perfect this bill."</p>
            <p>It cannot be urged as an objection to this proposition that it is too late, or that
              it will endanger the final success of the measure. That cannot be urged. There, are
              yet I believe nineteen days of this session remaining. These friends of temperance if
              they have procrastinated this measure, if they have put it off from day to day until
              it is too late in their judgment, to amend, they are responsible for that. They have
              had leave to report at any time and if there has been delay that delay can not be
              charged upon those who are seeking that the bill shall be rendered as nearly perfect
              as possible. But there is no danger of the defeat of this measure.</p>
            <p>We are told that the whole people of the State are aroused, and I am not one of those
              who believe that the Representatives of the people will not hear the voice of the
              people. I believe they will hear the voice of the people and I believe they will be
              governed by the voice of the people. I have confidence in the inteligence in the
              patrotism and in the fidelity to principle of the gentlemen in the other end of this
              capitol, and I am not one of those who believe that they can be influence by improper
              motives who believe that they will alllow a measure of this kind to be strangled in
              that end of the capitol. And if there are those here who want confidence in that end
              of the capitol let them vote against this proposition of the Senator from Boone. I
              plead with those who would have a genuine temperance bill on the statute books of
              Indiana to pause and examine and consider whether this is such a bill as the people of
              this State demand. I beg them to consider for a moment whether or not there are not
              great legal objections to some portions of this bill, and whether it is not better, in
              deference to the demands of the people to pause and perfect this bill. If as many as
              three of the amendments proposed by the Senator from Boone [Mr. Boone] are adopted I
              will vote for the passage of the bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. NEFF, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I am one of the
              Committee on Temperance in the Senate, and when the bill was first introduced into the
              Senate I was in favor of amending it, decidedly so. I believe now there were defects
              in the bill that ought to be remedied if it can be done without endangering its
              passage. I insisted before the Committee that it should be done. But the Committee
              thought that it would endanger its passage, and with the view of the majority of the
              committee, and on conferring with the members of a like committee of the House, I
              learned that it would probably endanger the passage of the bill. I withdrew all
              objections on that account, and agreed to say nothing in favor of amending the bill,
              but vote for it just as it was. If it could be done without endangering its passage I
              would be in favor of the reference. But believing as I do after having looked over the
              whole ground that it would endanger its passage I am in favor of passing it just as it
              came from the House of Representatives. I vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT, when his name was called said: I want to say to the Senate in explanation
              of my vote that so far as the friends of the bill belonging to the Committee of
              Temperance are concerned we are satisfied with this bill, and are in no wise alarmed
              by the reports of the Journal of this morning concerning the decission of some judge
              in Ohio. It would'nt have a feathers weight. I vote "no."33</p>
            <pb n="514" xml:id="VAA8558-14-514"/>
            <p>Mr. STEELE, in explanation of his vote when his name was called said: In another
              shape we are fighting the same battles over again that we fought on yesterday. The
              objections to this bill may be brought together in one single objection; and it is
              proposed now to send it to the <orgName>Committee on Temperance</orgName>. The object
              is evidently to gain time and nothing else. As far as this decission in Ohio is
              concerned as the gentleman from Vigo [Mr. Scott] says, I see nothing alarming in it.
              Some judge there perhaps has decided that some parts of the Ohio law are
              unconstitutional, but we have as able authority in favor of the constitutionality of
              this bill as it now stands as he authority of the Ohio judge, therefore I see no
              necessity of changing it one way or the other. Let us take this question up and vote
              for it at once. I vote "no" on this motion.</p>
            <p>Mr. THOMPSON said: Mr. President, I ask the indulgence of the Senate to make a
              statement of my reasons for voting in favor of the recommitment, of this bill, and
              which shall be my only plea to justify my opposition to its final passage. This I
              conceive alike due to myself, and to my constitutents, whose acquaintance, and
              friendship, I have ever esteemed my highest honor. The subject is attractive, which
              accounts for the pressing crowds, who have come to witness our action, in this Hall,
              on this day. I am sure it is their deep interest for, and against the bill, that
              brings them here. They have no other curiosity to gratify beyond this. The great men
              of the State, and nation have indulged them too often, with the ring of true eloquence
              and statesmanship, in this capitol, for them now to brave the inclemency of this
              winter day to hear speech making, through idle curiosity.</p>
            <p>Mr. President, I am too much oppressed with the delicacy which springs from my
              imperfections as a public speaker, and the different views I entertain, in reference
              to the merits of this bill, from those of a majority of this Senate, and from a large
              portion oi this vast audience, to rigidly conform my remarks to parliamentary rules,
              or bring them strictly within the expectation of Senators. Perhaps the charity, and
              pardoning power of the Senate, may keep pace with their patience, and permit me, in my
              feeble style, to execute my plans in laying before them my statement.</p>
            <p>When I was nominated, unexpectedly and unsolicited, on my part, to the position I
              hold, the subject of a radical temperance law was not mentioned in the convention.
              Some of the ardent temperance men of the State had already indicated in various ways,
              their determination to nominate a temperance ticket. Both the great panics were in the
              field making every preparation for the coming contest. Each was stimulated by the hope
              of success, or fear of defeat, to put forth an effort and energy in prosecuting the
              canvass unexampled, hitherto, in the history of the State.</p>
            <p>The Republican party, referring to its history and its principles, in the passed,
              strenuously advocated its present policy as substantial reasons for its success at the
              polls, and staked its advocacy before the people on its history and national policy.
              Its platform was essentially politic, and the convention regarded the position held by
              its political antagonists as too critical and dangerous to assume to add to its
              principles any of the moral questions agitated by the radical temperance movement.</p>
            <p>Thus having placed itself before the people; in a declaration of its principles, I
              was selected a nominee for the office of State Senator. It was under the full
              conviction that I was chosen on no other grounds than on the pure principles that
              constituted the platform of the national Republican party, that I had assured
              gentlemen of this city, that if elected, I would support no principle in the
              Legislature on the subject of temperance that did not enter into the canvass before
              the people. On the contrary I should feel bound to vote against any bill of the
              kind.</p>
            <p>In giving this assurance to my neighbors I done nothing more than was done by the
              leaders of both parties in this city. For so far as I was able to gather the
              intentions of politicians on this subject, both the prominent parties ignored the
              subject of a radical temperance law. The interests of the Republican party were deemed
              by me of more importance to the country than the passage of a stringent liquor law. No
              law, on the subject of temperance, passed in advance of the moral sentiments of the
              people can be executed; this has been tested in Indiana. And the Republican party of
              1856, received ample proof of this fact in the defeat of their ticket.</p>
            <p>In the management of my own affairs through life, I have never found it necessary to
              resort to false dealing either in word or deed, and I am sure that my neighbors and
              friends would dispise me, if in my act this day, it shall appear that I made my way to
              this Hall by deceit and fraud. It has been asserted that I should back down in this
              vote from promises made before my election; this could be done only by taking leave of
              all self respect, and presenting to this Senate and to this community a character
              unworthy of the confidence of a truth loving people. The principle of justice should
              not be violated by legislators with less impunity, than it should be by citizens in
              their commercial transactions. The State cannot afford to reform her long established
              customs or <pb n="515" xml:id="VAA8558-14-515"/> laws by rendering the property of any
              portion of her citizens valuless. Since the beginning of law in Indiana, these laws
              have encouraged the sale of spirituous liquors, by licensing the manufacture and sale
              of ardent spirits thereby declaring the commerce right and proper.</p>
            <p>This encouragement on the part of the State has induced many of her citizens to
              invest their money in this species of properly, until there are, it is said, upwards
              of fitly millions of dollars worth of liquors in the State owned by our citizens. This
              large accumulation of liquor is the result of legislation that extends as far back as
              fifty years. By the passage of this bill you allow the men your laws invited to engage
              in the traffic, no time to wind up their immense business, and by placing a ban on
              their commerce, you condemn their property as valueless, and turn them and their
              families out bankrupts.</p>
            <p>The bill refuses a year, a month, a week, or even one day to these people, in which
              they might remove their liquors to some quarter of the country where the law givers
              have not all turned saints, or if they have, they have not permitted their enthusiasm
              of sudden conversion to remove from their minds that great truth, that whoever would
              be holy must be first just, not only as citizens, but as legislators. If by the act of
              the State individuals have engaged in a business you regard as injurious to the morals
              and happiness of the people, she ought not to adopt the work of destruction as an
              atonement for errors perpetrated by the statute, for generations, but adopt a
              legislation that while it corrects the errors of the past, will afford ample time to
              those interested to relieve themselves through the channels of commerce, and the laws
              of trade.</p>
            <p>Past experience admonishes all law makers to confine their legislative acts within
              the bounds of stern justice to all the subjects of the State, and strictly within the
              wants and wishes of the people. To transcend these limits is a betrayal of their
              confidence, and a disgraceful usurpation of their rights.</p>
            <p>Good intentions of legislators can never substitute the demands of an intelligent
              constituency, ro lead the public sentiment to respect the laws which war against
              private interests under the specious plea of benefiting morals, or more thoroughly
              establishing th public safety. You propose to correct the errors of law by destroying
              property accumulated under its execution, and to save the morals of one class by
              destroying the property of another. If you correct false legislation and, at the same
              time, give all concerned in the sale and ownership of spiritous liquors, ample time to
              save themselves from financial ruin, why hesitate for a moment,to recommit with
              instructions, so to amend the bill.</p>
            <p>If the Senate shall depart from its usual calm and dispassionate character, this day,
              and manifest untimely haste in the execution of this bill, they may live to see it
              recorded in the statutes of the State, a law, but it will surely add to their
              mortification, if on account ot its severity, they shall behold the opposition of the
              people set it at defiance and sanction, by silent permission the terrible reign of
              free whisky throughout our large cities.</p>
            <p>Were the people of our commonwealth homeogenious, in their customs, tastes, views of
              morals, and State policy, sumptuary laws might meet with a certain administration, and
              the sanction of the governed. But we have come from all parts of the civilized world,
              bringing with us different views of religion, morals, and tastes, which make the
              faithful execution of such laws quite impossible, and engenders in the minds of
              perhaps a large majority of citizens the spirit of opposition to the law, and
              rebellion to the State that attemps its execution.</p>
            <p>If you send this bill forth as law, change it to afford ample time to all citizens,
              who are engaged in the liquor traffic to relieve themselves of this species of
              property, by exhausting their stock on hand, that all may enjoy the promised reign of
              temperance throughout the State. But if you send it out armed with vengence on the
              commerce of liquor traffic, declaring its "time shall be no longer," you, thereby,
              will convulse the public mind, and the law will be regarded as a declaration of war
              against private property, and will chalenge deadly hostility and political opposition
              to the party in power.</p>
            <p>Mr. President, I have said more on this subject than I intended, but the position I
              occupy and the importance of the bill, would not permit me to say less. I shall cast
              my vote in accordance with pledges made before the election. Honesty in the public
              servants of the State, truth in society, confidence between man and man; all demand
              this at my hand. And all I ask in return is that if ever an epitaph shall point to my
              character, it may record of me "that he performed all his obligations, kept his
              promises and never forsook his friends." I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>When the roll call was completed - </p>
            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the vote as above recorded.</p>
            <p>So the motion to recommit the bill was rejected.</p>
            <p>After some conversational debate the temperance bill was read the third time and
              finally passed by yeas 30, nays 19 - see page 188.</p>
            <p>Pending the roll call.</p>
            <p>Mr. BIRD, in explanation of his vote, <pb n="516" xml:id="VAA8558-14-516"/> when his
              name was called said, if this bill passes in my opinion it will yield no revenue to
              the school fund while the present law yields something like one hundrrd thousand
              dollars. I think the act now on the statute books was a much better law than this. I
              vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: I have in
              opposing this bill but sought to make something out of it. My judgment is that the
              bill is an imperfect one. I do not think all the provisions will be declared
              inoperative but in less than six months at the outside, in my judgment, the temperance
              cause in the State of Indiana as far as legal enactments are concerned will be in a
              very much worse condition than it now is. I have, however, discharged my duty to the
              best of my ability. I have cleared my conscience and those who have pressed and urged
              this bill upon the Senate for its passage, who have, with stubborness all the way
              through, refused to modify its confesed imperfections, may take the responsibility of
              its passage. I shall vote for their bantling and if trouble comes, they, and not I,
              are responsible. [Applause from the lobbies.]</p>
            <p>Mr. DITTEMORE moved that the lobbies be cleared.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. No motion is in order pending the roll call.</p>
            <p>Mr. DITTEMORE. If this Senate cannot protect itself from boisterous demonstrations by
              parties outside who are here by courtesy, we had better at once quit business.</p>
            <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Chapman in the chair.] Unless persons in the lobbies keep
              perfectly quiet and refrain from making any more noisy demonstrations, the sergeant at
              arms will clear the lobbies.</p>
            <p>Mr. COLLETT, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: I have been
              voting for amendments to this bill and have done so in good faith. I have given no
              votes for the purpose of delay or retarding action upon the bill. While I am anxious
              to have a good temperance law, I am anxious to have one as perfect as possible, and
              while there are a great many things in this bill I could wish to have amended and
              which would in my opinion, have made the bill much more perfect, the friends of the
              bill have seen proper to refuse to have it amended. Still, there are some good
              features in the bill, one of them making drunkenness a crime. It that were the only
              part of the bill that was constitutional, I would vote for this clause alone. I vote
              "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. GOODING, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said : I think it
              my duty and I am satisfied to reflect the wish and judgment of my constituents, and I
              think I do that when I vote against the bill. I vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. HARNEY, when his name was called, said: I wish to explain the vote I shall give.
              In my public life I have not been regarded par excellence as a temperance man. I have
              always doubted the efficacy of laws that are sumptuary in their character and are
              intended to enforce virture by legislation. It so happened that I was a member of the
              Committee which reported the law now in force. The present law worked well for a time,
              but the time has come to change it in order to adopt it to the present condition of
              the State. If I were left to submit a bill on this subject I would not take this one.
              This law would not be my first choice. If I were to select a law, I would take one
              which would not include vinous and malt liquors. But liquor sellers will not except
              such a law nor will they live up to it, and the temperance men will not be satisfied
              with it; therefore, it would be inoperative. Seeing this condition of affairs, and
              deeming myself that there should be a change in the temperance law of the State I
              shall vote for the bill which the temperance men of the State are in favor of and
              intend to enforce. There is one provision in the law mixed up with the crud
              provisions, to which I gave my hearty consent. That is the provision that emancipates
              women from the condition in which she has hitherto been placed. It allows her to sue
              for a wrong that is done to her. For that reason, if for no other, I shall vote
              "aye."This provision would secure my vote over other objections. Women have heretofore
              been victims without means of defence, and this provision gives her the privilege of
              entering the courts to redress her grievances. As far as my personal relations are
              concerned, I have made no pledges to one clan or another and I feel free to vote the
              way I think best reflects the wishes of my constituents. I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: In giving the
              vote I shall, I wish to say that I reflect the wishes of both my constituents and
              myself. I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. NEFF, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: When this bill
              was before the Committee I was decidedly in favor of amending it, perfecting it. I
              believed it was defective. I believed then that it would not meet the wishes of its
              friends, and I believe so yet. But my constituents were anxious that the bill should
              pass just as it came from the House, and I withdrew all objections to it on that
              account,because they were in favor of it, looking at it in this light, that if it did
              not prove what was expected, it would not be my fault, but theirs. I was in favor of
              striking out that <pb n="517" xml:id="VAA8558-14-517"/> part of the first section
              which takes away from a man the right to sell liquor by the small or large quantity
              without any responsibility, provided it is taken away from the premises where sold.
              This bill, if passed, would probably prevent any man in my county from getting a
              permit, but instead of that it will be filled up with irresponsible persons who can
              sell, to be taken away from the premises, any amount of liquor that they desire. But
              as my people are in favor of the bill as it is, and feeling if that amendment is made
              the bill would not pass the House of Representatives I will vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. ORR, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I am here
              without any instructions from my constituents, but knowing the moral "stata" of my
              people and being left to my own judgment in the matter I feel proud that I am here to
              represent my people without instructions. This bill is not as strong as I could wish,
              but inasmuch as I believe that the bill will be a preventative of crime in this
              country I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. SLATER, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: The only
              benefit I can see to result from the passage of the bill will be the breaking down of
              the Republican party. It is the death knell of the Republican party and I should vote
              for it if it wouldn't pass without any vote. But as it is, I shall vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. SLEETH, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: The Senator
              from Johnson (Mr. Slater) has indicated that this bill would be the death of the
              Republician party. Other Senators have indicated their opinion that the bill itself is
              unconstitutional and that it would be struck down by the courts. If it should give us
              free Democracy and free whisky that would be a bad state of affairs.</p>
            <p>Democracy will win then. The people I represent are very anxious for a temperance
              bill. I do not feel nor have I felt that this was such a bill as the people of the
              State are demanding. I have done all in my power, both in public debate in the Senate
              and in private conversations with Senators and with members of the committee, to have
              amendments made to this bill, which it is conceded, by those who oppose them, would be
              an improvement on the bill, and which I believe would be an improvement on the bill.
              They have, however, by the vote of the House, been laid on the table, and as I presume
              we can have no better law than this one, I am compelled, under protest, to vote for
              it, not believing that it is such a bill as the people of the State demand, and I
              leave the responsibility of supporting this bill with the people who have forced it
              through this house without amendment and with the courts of the State. I stand
              recorded in favor of every amendment offered which I thought would tend to perfect the
              bill; and now I must be content to vote for it as it is. I vote "aye.</p>
            <p>Mr. THOMPSON, when his name was called; in explanation of his vote, said: I regretted
              that I differ so materially from a large portion of the best friends I ever had in the
              State and I regret, also, that the bill, being the production of both parties of the
              Legislature both the Republicans and the Democrats and both acknowledging its
              imperfections, I regret that it has not been perfected. I regret it very much. I vote
              "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. WADGE, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said: I shall vote
              against the bill for the reason assigned by the Senator from Johnson (Mr. Slater.) I
              honestly believe the passage of the bill would be the death knell of the Republican
              party. Working, as I have with that party for the last fifteen years for its success
              it shall not be said that I have done anything to cause its death. I vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said : He had
              tried in his humble way to represent his constituents and he desired to do so in the
              vote he was about to give on the bill before the Senate, but if any of them favored
              such a law they had failed to make it known to him, as their representative upon this
              floor. Why pass a more stringent law until we enforce the one we have? The records of
              our courts show indictment after indictment, and not a violation of law the punished
              not a fine collected. He was opposed to putting laws on our statute books in advance
              of public sentiment, for that would fall stillborn from our hands and thus tend to
              bring all laws into disrepute. He stated that there were eight thousand voters in his
              district, over one-third of whom were Germans or their descendents. Wine and beer is
              their national beverage, they have, like tea and coffee, almost become a necessity -
              and he was opposed to depriving them of what seems necessary to their happiness at
              their social gatherings, while we allow the rich to stock their wine cellars with
              choice liquor, enjoy their luxuries, and entertain their guests at home. He voted
              "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence, desiring his name to be again called, said: In explanation
              of my vote I desire to say this: I have worked faithfully and earnestly and sincerely
              with a desire to have this bill perfected. It has not been done in my judgment. I
              believe that it will not be sustained by the courts. I have at any rate grave fears
              that it will not be sustained. I believe it will set the cause of intemperance back
              ten or fif- en years in Indiana, but I propose to let <pb n="518"
                xml:id="VAA8558-14-518"/> the responsibility rest where it properly belongs. I have
              received a great many petitions from my people asking for a temperance law. I believe
              that this is not such a one as they require, and yet I believe that it is the only one
              that will come before the Senate at this session, and in deference to the views of my
              constituents, and with very grave and serious doubts about the propriety of passing
              the bill, I will vote "aye,"</p>
            <p>Mr. BOONE, desiring his name to be called again, said: I propose to vote "aye" and I
              want to explain my vote if the Senate pleases. I believe the law now in force is a
              better temperance law to-day than the one we are now passing, if it were properly
              enforced. My constituents however, in both counties, that I represent, have but a
              small amount of means invested in this business, and the amount which they have is
              worse than if they had none. In my judgment, I have worked in good faith to try and
              perfect this bill,to make it as perfect as possible, for the purpose of giving to the
              people, a temperance law that might be effective in some degree. I have not done what
              I have with any factious feeling but in good faith. I have failed throughout. I judge
              that this law will be, in effect, a failure, but I have found in my practice that the
              better plan is, when the people want to have their own way about a thing for a little
              while to let them have it. They will find it a hard machine to run with. Therefore I
              have thought proper to change my vote. [When his name was first called he voted "no."]
              I voted "no" when my name was called for the purpose of seeing whether certain
              gentleman would show their hands or not. I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>When the roll call was finished.- </p>
            <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER announced the vote as above recorded.</p>
            <p>So the temperance bill finally passed the Senate. </p>

          <p> Pending the consideration of the bill [S. 6.] concerning the transportation of freight
            and passengers over Railroads within this State, repealing, etc., as the first special
            order in connection with the bill [S. 115] to prevent extortionate charges for, and
            unjust discriminations in, the transportation of freight by railroad companies and other
            common carriers, and to provide remedy when such extortions are practiced, etc. </p>
          <p>Mr. MILLER proposed to amend the bill S. No. 6, by striking out and inserting certain
            sections of the Senate bill No. 115.</p>
          <p>The SPEAKER called the gentleman's attention to rule sixty-four. The Chair cannot
            entertain the motion, because the Senate bill No. 115 is also before the House.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM could not so understand the rule sixty-four, and, more for the purpose of
            making a speech than for testing the soundness of the ruling, he moved to amend the
            pending bill S. No. 6, by striking out all after the enacting clause and inserting the
            matter of the bill's. No. 115. He said: Mr. Speaker, there is no question to come before
            us that is to have a deeper effect on the people of Indiana than the one now before the
            House. I know not how far the railroad system has contributed to our advancement; and
            that advancement is what we want; and we do not seem to, and perhaps we ought not to,
            care what it costs.</p>
          <p>But before I go any further, as a friend of the railroads, I will say that I have paid
            my individual fare on every railroad I have traveled over for the year that is past. -
            And now I desire to ask this House to reflect as to what they propose to do ? and
            especially to ask themselves whether in remedying one evil they will not make a greater
            one? I am as willing as any man to go as far as we legally can go to remedy the evils we
            complain of.</p>
          <p>Mr. Speaker: You start out with Senate bill 6, with an arbitrary rate for every
            railroad in the State - a thing that will crush out the poor railroads, and build up the
            big ones. Assuredly it must be evident to every man, that some of the railroads can live
            and make money at a rate of charges that others can not. Is it the desire of the House
            that no more railroads shall be built in Indiana? If you fix arbitrary rates for these
            roads, as the prices in Senate bill No. 6, you might as well provide that no more money
            shall come into the State for the construction of new roads. You could no more
            effectually drive railroad capital out of the State, than by the passage of that
            bill.</p>
          <p>There is the New Albany and Chicago railroad, and the Evansville and Crawfordsville
            railroad - they can't pretend to carry freights at the same rates, that can be afforded
            by the older and stronger railroads. Now in fixing the rates of freights, how are you
              <pb n="520" xml:id="VAA8558-14-520"/> to come at the true principle? I say the
            principle embodied in Senate bill 115, is the only one you can adopt.</p>
          <p>If the Constitution of the State would allow us to classify the roads, we could reach
            it. But we cannot do that. You have got to fix the rates all alike. I know that some of
            our railroads have never paid their stockholders anything: yet have not the regions of
            country through which their lines run realized a great benefit from them?</p>
          <p>Now what is the provisions of this Senate bill? It is that the rate over each road
            shall be fixed by the circumstances surrounding it - looking at, and considering the
            amount of business done by each road. I know that the Senate bill proposes to fix the
            rates by the charges for through freight between here and New York. It proposes to fix
            the rates in one of two ways. But what does it base its rate of charges upon, when it
            says, you shall not charge over one hundred per cent, more for transportations twenty
            miles, than for the whole distance? Do you mean you shall charge for hauling twenty
            miles at the same rate per mile, as for the whole length of the road within the State?
            or at the same rate per mile that you charge to New York? and how can you fix the rates
            of freight in this State by that rule, while the rates of freight to New York and the
            eastern cities are continually fluctuating? I say sir, if you want to make Indiana a
            desert as to railroads adopt this bill.</p>
          <p>Suppose you compel them to put up their charges on their through freight? There are two
            meanings to what is expressed here by through freight. One means the freight through to
            New York and Boston, and the other means the carrying of freight over the length of
            their lines in the State of Indiana. Now the Committee on Railroads proposes in the
            Senate bill No. 115 to understand by through freight, that which is carried within the
            State of Indiana, and then it provides that no greater sum shall be charged for a
            portion of the distance than for the whole distance. You have got to adopt the same
            rule.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, the Senate bill No. 115 proposes to leave the question as to what
            is reasonable with reference to damages, to the jury that may hear the case. What are
            the difficulties about which we complain ? There are two. One is, the railroads charge
            extravagantly over portions of their road - and more even than over their entire line.
            And another is, they exclude some classes of freight. Now Senate bill No. 115, compels
            these men to operate and to be liable as common carriers. I don't believe that the
            railroads holding special charters are beyond our reach. I don't believe that it is in
            the power of the State to part with a single particle of her sovereign power. I believe
            that the State has within itself the right to revoke every grant she has ever made by
            paying the resulting damages. Can she not then make any arrangement she pleases that
            will relieve this difficulty? This bill 115 provides that the freight shall be moved in
            the order of its shipment: and if the company refuse to move it, it shall be amenable
            for the damages - and the question of damages is left for the jury to settle along the
            lines where such movements are denied or delayed.</p>
          <p>Then this bill proposes to limit the charges - that in no case shall it be greater than
            over the whole line. And at the same time when unreasonable charges are made the courts
            are open, and parties can make their complaints and pleadings. But gentlemen say that
            this will be opening wide the door for interminable law suits. I do not believe it. Now
            I want gentlemen to look at this matter; and not from any prejudiced standpoint, but in
            the interest of the people. What ought we to do in regard to this matter? How are we to
            be just to the roads and to the shippers, the people? Do you want to drive the roads out
            of the State? certainly not. The State of Indiana has got three or four trunk railroads
            that can live. I suppose they could live by through business alone. But pass this bill
            No. 6, and what would be the result to the State of Indiana? These established railroads
            have but to come to Cincinnati and cross the Ohio bridge, and they can pass westward by
            the southern State routes, and never touch our borders: or they can take the northern
            lines, and do the same thing, only running through Indiana twelve or fifteen miles.</p>
          <p>Where then is the wisdom that would say to the people of Indiana who have capital
            invested in railroads; You shall not have any share in this through freight business? I
            say to you, sir, that you are as powerless to control the rates of through freight
            charged by the railroads as you are to control the waves of the ocean. Then you want to
            protect shippers from exhorbitant charges and leave to the road a fair per cent of their
            earnings. That is what the bill 115 does. But the other bill No. 6, will not ouly
            cripple all the new and weaker roads of the State, but it will effectually suspend the
            building of another mile of railroad. But that is not all, nor the worst. The State of
            Indiana has much undeveloped wealth. It has always been with us, but not generally known
            till lately, though I have been long acquainted with it. And why is this wealth yet
            undeveloped? It is because the lines of railroads have not reached it: and unless the
            people are helped to reach it, it will remain without utility till doomsday. We have <pb
              n="521" xml:id="VAA8558-14-521"/>coal and iron enough to supply the world indefinitely
            as to time. Is it any body's business to stay the hand of progress that would reach
            these shores of wealth ? No it cannot be. Then let us foster these great interests,
            instead of restraining them. Let us inflict no serious injury on the capital we have
            already invested.</p>
          <p>I know that the time has been that these railroads have made immense amounts of money:
            and the producers of the country have also made money, and I know that the prices of
            produce have gone down. But if you shut out these competing lines what will be the
            result? Your lands may be rich, and your produce may be abundant; but what will it be
            worth to you ? I know of cases where they have all winter long burnt their corn, because
            it was cheaper than cord-wood. Then we want that which will cheapen transportation to
            the people. But let us ask ourselves this question : Will it be right for us to say to
            these vandal railroads, You shall carry your neighborhood passengers and local freight
            at the same rate that you establish for carrying your passengers and freight over
            thousands of miles ? I will venture the assertion here, that, notwithstanding the fact
            that the owners and managers of these roads make immense fortunes, the people of Indiana
            in the mean time have actually made more money than they. I will not be understood by
            these remarks as justifying the unjust discriminations and extortions of these roads. I
            say they should be corrected. But I say the Senate bill No. 6, is impracticable,
            because, while it would paralize some of the roads, others would avoid its provisions
            and proceed without injury. I know some of them have made reductions of over fifteen per
            cent in their freight charges.</p>
          <p>And this bill, proposes that whatever rates they may make for their through carriage,
            for the whole length of their lines, in no case shall their local rates exceed their
            through rates. But their rates from New York are arbitrary and fluctuating. And suppose
            you say they shall make that the gage of their local rates ? What would be the result ?
            Every pound of their freight will be left at the State line; and there will be a local
            rate established over the State of Indiana and what does this bill No. 115 propose? It
            simply proposes that they shall not charge more to the nearer than to the fartherst
            point in the State. Now, take the Evansviile and our local State roads, and suppose you
            say they shall charge a certain rate per mile. Then those established routes will stop
            at the Indiana line, and the Ohio and Mississippi road will receive their carriages and
            the local rates established for this State. So it will not be in the power of
            legislation here to afford the remedy.</p>
          <p>But take the bill No. 115, and I know that is more practical. And what I know about
            railroading I learned by taking a pick and shovel, and working my way up through all the
            gradations to the last round in the ladder of railroad promotion. And I can take the
            provision for the idleness of cars in the bill No. 6, and make railroading pay without
            operating at all. Three dollars a day for each car will pay well enough, and you may
            switch them all aside and make money. But your bill proposes to make it five dollars.
            But the Senate bill which the <orgName>Railroad Committee</orgName> here have
            recommended provides that they shall move their freight in the order of the shipments,
            and the jury shall find the damages for delays. And ten dollars a day as your bill
            provides, will not he enough sometimes. I may self have lost hundreds of dollars a day
            by these delays, when perhaps, the roads have not been at all to blame.</p>
          <p>It is the unanimous opinion of the Railroad Committee that we will go as far as we
            ought to go by adopting the provisions of the Senate No. 115: for they found that the
            more they examined the subject the more difficult it becomes.</p>
          <p>The SPEAKER. The Chair understands the motion to be to amend the bill by striking out
            all after the enacting clause, and inserting the provisions of the Senate bill No. 115.
            That motion is not in order.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. Then I move to lay on the table the bill No. 6, for the purpose of taking
            up the Senate bill No. 115.</p>
          <p>The motion was agreed to - yeas 51, nays 21.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOODARD. I move to reconsider the vote just taken.</p>
          <p>Mr. OFFUTT. Mr. Speaker, inasmuch as the gentleman from Jefferson (Mr. Branhan) has
            been permitted when there was nothing before the House calling for a debate, to make an
            elaborate argument in favor of railroad corporations and monopolie generally, perhaps I
            will be excused, now that there is something before the House, for saying a word in
            behaif of the people, in whom the sovereign power of this and every other State is
            lodged. Sir, if I thought the desolation and ruin which has been so vividly and forcibly
            pictured here by the gentleman fron Jefferson (Mr. Branham), would be entailed upon the
            people of Indiana, in consequence of the passage of Senate bill No. 6, I certainly would
            vote against it. If I could conceive that the effect of the passage of the bill would be
            to drive capital from the State, or prevent its coming into the State, as contended by
            the gentleman from Jefferson, I could not conscientiously support the bill. But sir,
            this dread about driving capital out of the State is not a new song for the gentleman
            from Jefferson. I have <pb n="522" xml:id="VAA8558-14-522"/> heard him sing it before.
            True, it has been set to new music, but still it is the same old song. It was but
            yesterday we heard it said on this floor that if the bill introduced by the gentleman
            from Marion (Mr. Kimball) in relation to the record of legal instruments should fail to
            pass, it would have the effect to drive capital out of the State, and yet the bill did
            fail to pass, and so far as can be observed capital has remained statu quo.</p>
          <p>Again Mr. Speaker, it was said by the gentleman from Jefferson that if Senate bill No.
            6 becomes a law then railroad companies will increase the rates of transportation on
            through freights. Now I undertake to say that there is and will be no trouble as to the
            rates of through freight where there is competition. But when you get away from
            competition, when you leave railroad centers you will find that these monopolies, lay
            their hands heavily upon the people, and compel them to pay unjust and exhorbitant rates
            for shipping. It is the tariff on local freights that require the restraints of law, and
            in voting upon this question I hope the House will keep in view the wants and needs of
            the people who live at intermediate or way stations. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from
            Jefferson informed us in the opening of his remarks, that he had paid his fair on every
            railroad in the State over which he had traveled for the last year. Does the gentleman
            mean to insinuate that because forsooth, some railroad company may have given some
            member of this House a pass over their road, that therefore he is under obligation to
            them with this measure. The gentleman may so insinuate if he pleases, but I should
            hesitate long before placing such an estimate upon any gentleman upon this floor.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM, here interupted and said: Mr. Speaker, it has been charged that I am the
            special friend of railroads and that I ride free over all of them. I made the remark to
            rebut that.</p>
          <p>Mr. OFFUTT. Mr. Speaker, I never heard that charge made against the gentleman: neither
            do I make it now. I impugn no man's motives; I leave it to the House to determine from
            the gentleman's own conduct in reference to this measure, whether he is the champion of
            railroads or not.</p>
          <p>I desire now Mr. Speaker, to say a few words in reference to Senate bill No. 115. It is
            but natural that the gentleman from Jefferson should think that this bill contains all
            the freight regulations that can be wisely incorporated into a law upon this subject. He
            is the father of this article.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. No, sir, I am not the father of the bill.</p>
          <p>Mr. OFFUTT. Well, you may not be its natural parent, but you adopted it into your
            family at a tender age, and you are now watching over it with a fatherly care.
            [Laughter.] Mr. Speaker, I hope the members of this House have carefully read and
            considered the provisions of this favorite measure of the gentleman from Jefferson. I
            have given it some attention, and now undertake to say that there is not a single
            section of the bill that is worth any more than the paper on which it is written.
            Substantially the bill is this:</p>
          <p>That railroad companies shall charge reasonable rates of fare and reasonable tariff on
            freights.</p>
          <p>But it does not pretend to determine what is reasonable. Thus you see it leaves the
            matter just where it finds it - in the hands of the railroads.</p>
          <p>It is claimed that section seven regulates the question of freights and great stress
            was laid upon the virtue and efficacy of that section by the gentleman from Jefferson,
            as though it was the "panacea for all ills." Gentlemen "lend your ears,"and listen to
            the peculiar wording of that section, and then determine for yourselves whether upon any
            fair construction it can afford any relief whatever to the people of Indiana. It
            reads:</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="blockquote">Section 7. It shall not be lawful for any railroad company or its
              agents, or for any person or officer operating or managing a railroad situated within
              this State to charge or collect for the transportation of goods, merchandise,
              property, or freights on such railroad as large or a larger or a grealer amount as
              toll or compensation than is or shall be at the same time charged or collected for the
              transportation of like quantities of the same class of goods, merchandise, property or
              freight over a greater distance upon the same road.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>Mr. Speaker, if this is what we are to rely upon for relief from railroad extortions, I
            hope the gentleman from Jefferson will explain its meaning.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM: I will take the road from Indianapolis to Richmond for an illustration. I
            take the latter place because Richmond is a competing point. Then Knightstown, between
            here and Richmond is not a competing point. And the provision is that they can't charge
            any more for freight from here to Knightstown than they can charge for the same freight
            from here to Richmond.</p>
          <p>Mr. OFFUTT: I am always glad to agree with my friend from Jefferson, when I can, and I
            am pleased to see that he gives the section an honest construction; and according to his
            own construction it permits railroad, companies to discriminate as heavily against local
            freights as they possibly can now. Now, the bill, says according to the construction of
            the gentleman from Jefferson, and I except it as the proper construction - that you must
            not charge for a car <pb n="523" xml:id="VAA8558-14-523"/> load of freight to
            Knightstown more than you charge for the same freight to Richmond. The distance from
            this city to Richmond is sixty-nine miles; to Knighlstown is thirty-three miles. Then
            under this bill you may charge for moving a car thirty-three miles as much as for moving
            it sixty-nine miles. I go farther. Mr. Speaker, I contend that under this section of
            this bill a railroad company may charge within one cent as much for carrying freight one
            mile that they do for carrying it one hundred miles, if they please to do so. In short,
            sir, it leaves the whole matter as effectually in the hands of the roads as it is now.
            It regulates nothing and in my judgment is simply a lame attempt at "white-washing" this
            question over in the interest of railroad corporations.</p>
          <p>For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to Senate bill No. 115, and hope the
            motion of the gentleman from Park to reconsider the vote laying Senate bill No. 6 on the
            table may prevail, and that bill passed the House. And in this connection, I desire to
            call attention to a provision of Senate bill No. 6, which is not in Senate bill No. 115.
            I regard it as a very important provision and one that will meet with the approval of a
            large and respectable portion of the people of the State. I refer to section nine. That
            section provides that railroad companies shall carry all kinds of freights, and
            prohibits them from discriminating in favor of one class of freights to the detriment of
            another. In a word, sir; it compels them to transport all kinds of freight, and it
            further provides that railroad companies shall furnish within a reasonable time the
            means of transportation. I don't know what trouble shippers may have in other parts of
            the State, but in the county I have the honor to represent shippers find it difficult
            indeed to get cars to transport their stock and grain to market. Now the gentleman from
            Jefferson contends that railroad companies are not responsible for this. I think they
            are, and I think further that we have a clear right to regulate this matter and that we
            ought to do so. For example Mr. Speaker, suppose a man living on the line of one of the
            roads leading into this city is engaged in buying and shipping live stock and has on
            hands ten thousand dollars worth of hogs, and hogs are worth here eight hundred dollars
            per hundred and that owing to the failure of the railroad company to furnish him the
            means of transportation he is unable to get his hogs to the market for two or three
            weeks and that in the meantime the price goes down one half, the result is the man is
            ruined financially, and who, I inquire is responsible for it? Why, clearly the railroad
            company. Now, Mr. Speaker I have said all I desire to say at this time on this subject I
            think the impositions now being practiced upon the people of the State by the railroad
            corporations are very apparant. The people everywhere are calling upon us for relief and
            I do hope this House may not adjourn without passing this bill, [Senate bill No. 6,]
            which in my judgment is the only one now before the House that will give the people of
            the State any substantial relief.</p>
          <p>Mr. WALKER. This is a question of no ordinary importance. I do not desire to attack the
            motives of anybody. I do not intend to pursue any class of men with a vindictive spirit.
            I wish to legislate with equal and exact justice to all. I know very well that the
            railroads have enhanced the blessings of the country. And therefore we ought not to cry
            out against the thunder, when we know that along with the thunder come the blessings of
            the rain. My objection to the Senate bill No. 115 is, that there is no provision at all
            in it for the regulation of rates of travel. Did the House consider that when it voted
            to lay Senate bill No. 6 on the table you leave out that altogether? But the Senate bill
            No. 6 fixes that.</p>
          <p>Now I believe without any disrespect to the author of this bill [S. No. 115, that it is
            glittering all over with generalities. Now, sir, suppose you had been imposed upon by
            railroads - had suffered from their discriminations and extravagant charges - and
            suppose you direct this first section of this bill at them :</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="blockquote">"Be it enacted, etc., That is is hereby declared to be the duty of
              every railroad company, and every other common carrier engaged in the transportation
              of freight for hire, to transport along and over its line of travel, and between way
              stations on said line all kinds of freight which such company or carrier has been or
              may be accustomed to carry on or over any part of said line, and which may be offered
              for transportation at, and for reasonable rates or compensation; and in estimating
              what compensation or rates shall be considered reasonable, the distance over which the
              freight shall be carried, and the nature of the articles or commodities carried, shall
              be taken into consideration."</hi>
          </p>
          <p>A delightful lecture it is to the railroad companies - a declaration as to what is
            their duty! and what does that amount to? I do not believe that it will reflect any
            credit on my judgment to vote for this bill, nor that it can have any other effect,
            unless it might serve to raise a hugh and cry amongst some people, that we have done
            something frightful. I fully agree with the gentleman from Hancock [Mr. offutt,] as he
            presents this question, especially as to what will be the effect under the provisions of
            section 7 of this bill. It will be this: If any railroad company may charge fifty
            dollars a car from Richmond to Indianapolis, the same or any other company may charge
            forty-nine dollars ninety-nine cents for moving a car ten <pb n="524"
              xml:id="VAA8558-14-524"/> miles or any other number of miles of that distance!</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. If the gentleman were on a jury how would he decide that question of
            right?</p>
          <p>Mr. WALKER. What does it amount to, to give an individual the empty right of action to
            any party who has perhaps not more than twenty dollars involved in the question ? Where
            is the wisdom of going to law against a railroad company which pays five thousand
            dollars a year to its lawyer, by a man who has a claim of only a few dollars against it?
            He has a right to recover, but his claim will never or very rarely exceed the price he
            has to pay his attorney. The right of action amounts to just nothing. Heretofore they
            have charged us more for carrying half way to Indianapolis, than for carrying all the
            way. But under this bill they may charge for carrying to Centerville within one cent of
            what they charge for carrying to this city.</p>
          <p>But as to competition; what does this competition amount to in Indiana? We tried that
            in Wayne county, in building the Fort Wayne road. Before the iron was laid along come
            the Pan-Handle and leased the road, and so held the monopoly. These solid companies,
            like Aaron's rod swallow up all the rest; and you have no competition on which to rely.
            There is no other road for us except the New York Central; and whenever it is necessary
            they combine and fix the rate of travel, and you are powerless. So you can't rely upon
            competition, for they take away competition by leasing the roads built by the taxation
            of the people. Now what can we do ? Nothing, but to attempt to compel the company to
            make their charges for freights and passengers as equitable as we can. That is all that
            is left to us; and that I believe is provided under section one of the bill No. 6.</p>
          <p>Now, sir, I believe, even if this is wrong, it is better to let this thing crystalize
            into law - let it receive judicial interpretation - let us have two years in which this
            thing may settle down into practice, - and at the end of that time we may have a great
            deal more light than we have now. And, in the mean time, is it not better for this
            Legislature to whistle down the breakes now? Let us pass this bill now, and look to some
            future Legislature for relief, if we are wrong. We desire to save the people of the
            State, and save them now. But this Senate bill number 115 amounts to nothing more than
            the paper upon which it is written. But as to this section one of that bill I would like
            to take it and perhaps another section and embody it as an amendment of Senate bill No.
            6, for it is probable with all our lines of railroad, that they will charge a greater
            rate for the shorter than they ought to charge for the longer distance. And at the end
            of section one of Senate bill No. 6, I should prefer to cut out the lines twenty-three
            to twenty-five; then the virtue of the bill if it has virtue will be in that
            proposition. But I must say again, that, according to my judgment, our action will
            result in nothing but glittering generalities if we pass the Senate bill No. 115. The
            people will find themselves remedyless. I do hope the House will reconsider its
            action.</p>
          <p>Mr. SHIRLEY. I hope the house will reconsider this vote, and amend the Senate bill No.
            6. Let us pass that, and have its workings for two years.</p>
          <p>Mr. COWGILL. If it should be right to pass the bill No. 6, I hope it will be passed:
            but I fear that the reasonings in its favor are not much to be relied on. I want to call
            attention to section seventh of the bill [S. No. 115.] I think gentlemen might see that
            they are mistaken in regard to this section. They take the road from Indianapolis to
            Richmond and Centerville is on that road six miles from Richmond. Now the provission of
            section seven is that the railroad company shall not charge a greater rate of freight
            from Centerville to Richmond or from Knightstown to Richmond than from Indianapolis to
            Richmond. And I would like to know if this word "reasonable" does not occur also in the
            bill S. No. 6? In the bill No. 115 it is provided that whenever any exhorbitant or
            unreasonable charge has been made and collected, it can be recovered back. It is true,
            the very material question as to what is "reasonable" arises, and has to be decided; but
            that question is no more inevitable under the operation of this bill than under the
            other. I think the bill No. 115 does what is just and fair between shippers and
            railroads; and that at least it is much more fair and equal in its provisons than the
            bill No. 6. The argument of the gentleman from Jefferson (Mr. Branham) has not been
            answered, and cannot be answered and there are several provisions in the bill No. 6 that
            are unreasonable and unjust.</p>
          <p>[Then the subject was passed over by the adjournment.]</p>

          <p>The SPEAKER announced the question on Mr. Woodard's motion to reconsider the vote of
            yesterday by which the bill [S. 6] considering the transportation of freight and
            passengers over Railroads within this State, etc., was laid on the table with notice of
            Mr. Branham's motion to take up the Railroad bill [S. 115.]</p>
          <p>Mr. WILSON of Ripley. Mr. Speaker, I think that by this time every man on this floor
            must have recognized the fact, that this question is beset with difficulties. I am
            interested in this question just as any other citizen, excepting as to the pecuniary
            sense of the word. I want a bill that shall be just to all parties; and as I understand
            the provisions of the bill [S. 6] its operation will not be just to the Railroad
            companies. I read from the first section:</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="blockquote">"For transporting any of the aforesaid articles a distance of more
              than twenty miles, and not more than fifty, miles, at a rate not exceeding
              seventy-five per cent, above the rates fixed and charged for transporting freight over
              the entire length of such railroad. For transporting the aforesaid articles a greater
              distance than fifty miles, at a rate not exceeding fifty per cent, above the rates
              fixed and charged for transporting freight over the entire length of such
              railroads."</hi>
          </p>
          <p>For an illustration of the operation of this section, I will take the Ohio and
            Mississippi Railroad, because perhaps I am more familiar with that road. That railroad
            is three hundred miles long; and for their through freight they charge thirteen dollars
            per mile per car; and charging at that rate for a car from Delaware to Perrysville, it
            would be just twenty-six cents per mile. Add one hundred per cent, and it will be just
            fifty-two cents per mile. I presume this is a fair illustration of the workings of the
            bill on all the lines of railroad in the State: and every gentleman must grant that this
            would be exceedingly unjust to the railroad companies: for we must not forget that it
            does not cost them much more time and trouble to transport their shipments the whole
            length of their line than any shorter distance. Then considering the time for loading
            and discharging they would receive but about fourteen or fifteen cents a day per car,
            without any account of the labor and the expense of hauling.</p>
          <p>I am confident that it is impossible to fix that kind of a tariff without doing the
            utmost injustice to the railroads, and at the same time it would be doing injustice to
            the shippers. And this is only one of the defects of the bill. There are similar defects
            all through it.</p>
          <p>Let us now take up the Senate bill No. 115. I desire to call attention especially to
            the seventh section. It is this:</p>
          <p>SEC. 7. It shall not be lawful for any railroad company, or its agents, or for any
            person or officer operating or managing a railroad situated within this State, to charge
            or collect for the transportation of goods, mer- <pb n="526" xml:id="VAA8558-14-526"/>
            chanize, property or freight on such railroad, as large or a larger or greater amount as
            toll or compensation, than is or shall be at the same time changes or collected for the
            transportation of like quantities of the same class of goods, merchandise, property or
            freight over a greater distance upon the same road.</p>
          <p>Now this section will obviate nearly all the harshness that has been pointed out in the
            other bill. Take the same railroad - the Ohio and Mississippi again for an illustration.
            The rate from Cincinnati to St. Louis was fifty dollars per car: and if this seventh
            section had been in operation it would have cost the shippers but just twenty-seven
            dollars per car for their shipments to any intermediate point between Cincinnati and St.
            Louis.</p>
          <p>It seems to me that there is one section in the amendments of the House to the Senate
            bill No. 6, that should be inserted in the bill S. No. 115; that section is No. 9. It
            provides that the railroad companies shall furnish a car or cars to the same consignee
            on the demand of the shipper; and it requires the company to carry all kinds of
            freight-lumber, coal, grain, live stock, wood - everything that the shippers require.
            People complain about the railroads refusing to carry wood, and the Senate bill No. 115
            would not compel them to carry wood; but this section 9, in connection with the
            provisions of section seven of the Senate bill No. 115, would compel them to carry
            cord-wood, making that article cheaper in the cities, and worth more all along the lines
            of all the railroads.</p>
          <p>Now my suggestion is this: take Senate bill No. 115, as it stands now, (which I think
            is just in all its provisions except the proviso,) and insert this section nine, and so
            pass it back to the Senate for their concurrence. It may be hard to determine in some
            cases as to what is reasonable and right and just: but as a general thing the juries are
            not favorable to the railroad companies. I presume they are quite as hostile to them and
            as unwilling to do them justice as we are. They give verdicts for the very highest
            estimates of damages, and often the supreme court is compelled to reverse them. I think
            the only thing we can do is to compel them to carry all kinds of freight, and to move
            the same at reasonable rates: and then, if they charge more than the shippers can pay,
            or afford to pay, the courts can come in and compel them to reduce their rates and make
            them reasonable.</p>
          <p>We can't afford to legislate so as to cripple these railroads. Then our power stops at
            the State line. They can charge what they pleas up to the State line and so make up the
            deficiency occasioned by our tariff, And besides there are a number of smaller roads and
            weaker companies that would be utterly ruined by the passage of bill No. 6. It seems to
            me, that no intelligent mind, at all familiar with the subject, can favor Senate bill
            No. 6, without he has a desire to injure the railroads and the people of the State. I
            hope, therefore, that this vote will be reconsidered, and that these two bills will be
            recommitted to the Judiciary Committee, or some other committee, with instructions to
            make the amendments that I have suggested to the bill 115.</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLET. I must say that my conclusions are about the same with those of the
            gentleman from Ripley. This is a question in which the people feel an interest. Certain
            it is that abuses and wrongs have crept into our Railroad System; and the people are
            demanding redress; and they expect us to give it. This discussion must have disclosed
            these facts to every mind: and while it is important that the Railroad Tariff for
            passengers and freights should be as low as practible, still it does not become the
            State of Indiana to compare the railroad with a Chinese wall to keep out these abuses:
            therefore I shall not support any bill to rnanacle the Railroad which I think would be
            detrimental to the interests of the State.</p>
          <p>I believe there are objections to the Senate bill No. 6 which it would be very
            difficult for us to surmount. You propose, in that bill to regulate the tariff of
            freight according to the through rates charged by the leading lines through the State.
            Now what would be the effect of that? I will call the attention of the House to the
            principle involved in this bill of regulating the tariff according to the standard of
            the through rates charged by the leading lines. The evil complained of is the work of
            the through lines - inflicted by the larger railroads. The gentlemen from Jefferson (Mr.
            Branham) referred the difficulty to the proper source: the larger companies opening
            their mouths and swallowing up the smaller ones. It is those companies that are coining
            the money, that are swallowing up the competing lines as fast as they are built. This is
            where the wrong lies. And the question is whether the Senate hill No. 6 will remove the
            difficulty: or whether it will not rather increase the hardships.</p>
          <p>It has been stated by the gentleman from Jefferson that one of its effects will be to
            drive the great channels of trade outside of the State: they will go round the State
            either above or below. So we are in their power, so far as that is concerned. Another of
            its effects might be appreciated in these facts: The city of Indianapolis is a great and
            growing city, giving wealth to the State and developing her resources in every
            direction. Her well filled houses of trade are competing with those of other western
            cities - drawing trade from Cincinnati <pb n="527" xml:id="VAA8558-14-527"/> meeting her
            more than half way. Then by passing this bill you would drive away the trade of this
            city, and embarrass the farmers all over the State - sending them to Cincinnati, and
            Chicago, and building up those places by the distruction of Indianapolis; and if its
            effects might be felt by the through lines it seems evident that its effect on them
            would be very slight. I think I know whereof I speak when I say that the money made by
            the railroads is not made by the local freight nor by the passenger travel. It is the
            through freight that builds them up. Whenever this is not the case the exception is
            extraordinary.</p>
          <p>Then what will be the effect of the bill so far as the smaller roads are concerned?
            With the most of them their whole business depends upon the local freight and passenger
            travel: and the bill would cut them down to competition with the through lines, a thing
            which never can be and never could appear just. There are many railroads in the State
            located where the travel is meager and which are running but one passenger train and one
            freight train each way per day; and they are charging rates almost double those you
            propose to allow. The New Albany and Salem railroad is one of this class - one of the
            oldest and poorest of all our Railroads and you propose to make the charge with them the
            same as on the Pan-Handle,whilst one is coining money, and the other is loosing. It
            would build up the Pan-Handle and destroy the weaker and older road: and finally: it
            would make the most successful road a huge anaconda, which would swallow up all the
            neighboring railroads.</p>
          <p>For example: the Pan-Handle road between here and Richmond runs three passenger cars
            each way per day. Each car averages fifty passengers; and you will allow them such rates
            as will make the receipts for each car three hundred dollars per day. Then if you take
            the New Albany and Salem with its single car, carrying perhaps one half the number of
            passengers which each one of the Pan-Handle cars will carry, the effect will be to take
            the trains off the road.</p>
          <p>And the same argument would apply to every new road, with the exception proba- of the
            Vandalia road. While I would vote for a bill to compel such rates upon roads that are
            really paying upon the capital used in them I would be unwilling to destroy the roads
            whose very existence depends upon their present charges for the benefit of such a
            law.</p>
          <p>There is yet another consideration. The Legislature a few years ago provided that the
            different counties might assist the railroad companies about the building of their lines
            within their county limits. My county has paid large sums of money for such roads. Some
            of them are completed and some are not. Many of them were built upon the idea that they
            would be paying roads, upon the charges they now make. The effect of this bill upon such
            roads as have been built upon that estimate would be to take off their cars; and the
            effect upon such as are not completed would be to prevent their construction. My county
            has one hundred and fifty thou-and dollars in such a projected road, and it is very
            doubtful whether it can be built under the present circumstances. But you think it would
            be a paying investment to iron and equip the road even if they could be allowed to
            charge the existing rates. If this bill were to pass it never would be built certainly.
            This is but a single example in our county: and the same may be said of several other
            counties wherein roads would be sunk - lost by this bill forever.</p>
          <p>I think, sir, that the existing hardships under our Railroad System would be greatly
            relieved by affixing the House amendment, section ten, to the Senate bill No. 6, which
            provides that they shall furnish cars upon reasonable notice at reasonable rates, under
            reasonable circumstances for the shipment of all kinds of freight which it may be proper
            for them to ship. That can be done, without making your arbitrary rates of charges.
            While I believe the Senate bill No. 115 to be almost nugatory now, I think it could be
            amended so as to make it a very good bill. I think section three and its proviso, which
            will compel the Railroad, in case it is sued, and judgment is obtained for excess of
            charges over what they should be, would bring us to the solution of the difficulty,
            because it would not only compel the Railroads to pay the excess, but make them pay the
            cost of the suit and the attorneys fees. The gentleman from Wayne (Mr. Walker,)
            complains that no man who has but a small bill against a Railroad can afford to pay
            attorneys fees and spend his time in a law suit with them. And such, of course, is the
            fact. The Railroad has its attorneys paid by the year, and the suit costs them nothing.
            But make the company pay the charges of this kind if the judgment is recovered, and it
            seems to me that they would be careful about exacting extortionate charges from any
            person on their lines, and so very few provocations to have suits would arise.</p>
          <p>And now believing that a bill which would be unobjectionable to the House could be made
            by embodying parts of the Senate bills 6 and 115, I move that the two bills be
            recommited to the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>: and that they report a
            new bill that will be satisfactory; and that they submit the report next Wednesday at
            ten o'clock.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOODARD. It seems to me that we shall have to postpone this matter or <pb n="528"
              xml:id="VAA8558-14-528"/> have no legislation on the subject. But I could inform
            gentlemen that it can't be long before we shall have as great a demand for legislation
            on this subject as we have had for legislation on the subject of Temperance. It's
            nothing but right that we should do something to repress these monopolies that are
            crushing out the rights and liberties of the people: and I even wonder why the
            Legislature has not discovered it long ago. But now, when we have a practicable bill,
            gentlemen are proposing to refer it and to change and destroy any legislation that would
            effect the railroads of the State : and they are telling you that injustice is likely to
            be done to the railroads of the State; and they are silent as to the injustice done to
            the people. The Senate bill No. 115 is virtually ineffectual. There is not a single
            penalty attached to it. We might do much better simply to send a memorial for justice to
            the Presidents and Directors of the Railroads. It would have a better effect. If we
            simply say they shan't charge extravagant rates, that they shall be reasonable etc., -
            who is to determine what is extravagant and what is reasonable? That would be the query,
            upon which we should have to appeal to the Railroad men themselves: and they would have
            to determine all such questions. I do not want to discriminate against any particular
            institution, but I do want the people to be protected against their hardships in this
            matter. But while we, in this State continue to be very tenacious about the rights of
            the railroads; in almost every other State they have laws restricting them: then why
            should not we do the same? [He made a statement of figures of his own, and from the
            report of a Congressional Committee charged with the in-investigation of this subject,
            to show what he himself had suffered from railroad exorbitances and that their rates
            from St. Louis, Louisville, etc., to New York are continually fluctuating; and he
            continued: Why can't the Railroads determine and fix what would be a fair charge for
            transportation, and not be continually putting the prices up and down? They certainly
            can determine as well as we can the cost of their labor, coal, wood, rolling stock, etc.
            I am willing they should have fair profits; but when they come to watering their stock
            and centralizing their power, then I am for the rights of the people.</p>
          <p>I will say to the gentleman that they can't refer to a single case in the whole country
            where Legislation has done injustice to the Railroad companies. - If gentlemen hac
            suffered what I have suffered at the hand of the Railroads, they would realize that we
            ought to have some laws restricting them.</p>
          <p>The SPEAKER. The motion of the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Mellett) is not in order.
            The question is on the motion to reconsider the vote by which the Senate bill No. 6 was
            laid on the table.</p>
          <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. Mr. Speaker. I hold in my hand a petition praying this Legislature to
            enact the Senate bill No. 6. It is signed by one hundred of the leading business men of
            Gibson county.Now it seems to me that, in approaching a question of this kind, we ought
            not to do it as advocates or partizans, but that we should approach in the spirit of
            fairness and candor, that we may be able to do justice to both sides,where there seems
            to be conflicting interests.</p>
          <p>Now, I confess that in a matter of this kind no man can find himself entirely free from
            doubt as to what is just, or right or expedient - exactly. It seems to me that, in
            considering a question of this kind, we ought not to jump at conclusions, but take as
            careful survey of the facts about which we are to deal as possible, under the
            circumstances. I do not stand here as a friend or an enemy of Railroads. I stand here
            simply as a member of the Legislature of the State, intent upon doing what is right and
            just as between the people and the Railroad corporations. Now, by the vote of the House
            yesterday, we substituted the Senate bill No. 115 for the Senate bill No. 6, and the
            question before us is, shall we reconsider that vote? In order to determine that
            question we ought to consider the provisions of the Senate bill No. 115, and see whether
            they are capable, in the form in which the bill comes to us, of meeting the wants of the
            people. We find then, in this bill the requirement that the Railroads shall carry
            freight for reasonable rates. It does not prescribe what those rates are. It fixes no
            basis upon those rates, or their compensation is to be estimated. We find that tt
            provides no penalty worth anything to the people when this presumption may be neglected.
            Now if any legislation at all is needed, this bill certainly will not meet the case.
            When the people are asking for "bread" if we enact this bill for them, it would be but
            "giving them a stone." If this bill becomes a law, what practical end will it
            subserve?</p>
          <p>It seems to me that it will do no good; that it is incapable in its present form or
            with the amendments suggested, of meeting any want of the people or of establishing
            justice between the people and the Railroad corporations. It seems to me, that
            notwithstanding any provision in this bill, the Railroads could fix for themselves their
            own rates of compensation and that the people would be utterly powerless: and if a man
            goes into a a law suit with a Railroad corporation upon an issue as to what they shall
            say is a reasonable rate of compensation for freight car- <pb n="529"
              xml:id="VAA8558-14-529"/> ried, - I ask any gentleman to say what success there could
            be in that kind of a law suit? Do not the Railroads have the complete mastery of all
            questions in litigations of this kind? Certainly the shipper could not be redressed
            under this bill.</p>
          <p>But it is proposed that, in a suit to recover for an overcharge for freight, it shall
            be provided that if the railroad lose, it shall pay the attorneys fees. It seems to me
            that would be a barren remedy. For in the first place, the determination of the suit
            would be uncertain: and then, simply to provide a law to enable the people to recover
            for exorbitant charges, without providing any basis upon which those charges can be
            determined, is putting into the hands of the people but a barren scepter. It seems to me
            that we might as well not legislate at all as to legislate in the direction of this
            Senate bill No. 115.</p>
          <p>Now what is the Senate bill No. 6? and right here I must premise that all the
            provisions of Senate bill No 6, do not exactly suit me; and I do not suppose that a bill
            can be made which will exactly meet the requirements of every gentleman in this matter.
            It is a very difficult matter to legislate upon. The railroad corporations do a very
            extensive business; and in considering questions of this kind, we ought to know and
            remember the difficulties, and act as wisely as we can under all the circumstances. We
            ought to act as practical men - to do the best we can, even if we can't do as well as we
            might desire.</p>
          <p>But is the Senate bill No. 6, in its present form or with amendments, capable of
            meeting the requirements of the people? It seems to me that this ought to be the bill
            upon which we should act, rather than the Senate bill No. 115. The Senate bill No. 6
            provides (as one of its features) that the passenger charge shall be at the rate of
            three cents per mile. But now, ought we to regulate the passenger tariff at all ? ought
            we to prescribe any specific sum? If we can answer that in the affirmative, then we have
            here a basis to go upon. It seems to me that the passenger tariff ought to be regulated
            by legislation: and we find that it is regulated in some of the eastern States. In the
            eastern States the rates of travel on the railroads average about one half the rate
            here. About two and a half cents per mile seems to have paid well enough there. And it
            is a fact that legislation reducing fare to two and a half cents per mile did not seem
            to rob the eastern States of their capital. It may make them those Erie difficulties
            which the gentleman from Jefferson undertook to parley to us about yesterday. So it
            seems to me that we have this right to regulate the rates of travel on the railroads in
            the same way and for the same reason that we regulate tolls on the gravel roads - on
            account of their public character - and they receive benefits which they would not if
            they were mere private parties. Then, is that basis here - three cents a mile - the
            correct basis? It seems to me, from what knowledge I have of the matter, that three
            cents would be enough here, if two and a half cents were enough in the eastern States.
            We know that is as much as is charged in the western States where there is
            competition.</p>
          <p>I do not propose to say much upon the subject of freight tariffs. It seems to me that
            the remarks submitted yesterday by the gentleman from Hancock (Mr. Offutt) and the
            gentleman from Wayne (Mr. Walker) illustrated the justice of providing rates of freight.
            As to the through freight, there is no necessity for regulating that, because there is
            competition: and it seems to me that the basis established in this bill is correct.
            There is no doubt, that, where there is no competition, the railroads do charge
            exorbitant rates.</p>
          <p>And I will say that, in my opinion, the railroads here will all meet the demands of
            this bill, even if it is not exactly what it ought to be. It seems to me, sir, that in
            the language of this memorial from Gibson county, by enacting the Senate bill No. 6, you
            will be making the railroad legislation which is required in this State. Then let us
            enact some bill that will provide a remedy for the people against the exhorbitant
            charges of the Railroads where there is no competition to protect the people.</p>
          <p>Mr. THAYER. Mr. Speaker: The Railroad question is one of vital importance to the
            people, and one which materially effects the prosperity of the State and should be
            maturely considered before we make a law to regulate it. The cry of Railroad monopolies
            high rates of freight etc., which come to us from almost every quarter assures us that
            legislation is necessary; but, it should be of such a character that while it would
            protect the people from the oppression of monopolies, it would also protect an interest,
            which we all recognize as one of the most important in the State and one to which we are
            more indebted than any other, for the rapid development of our resources.</p>
          <p>A law that would cripple or retard this interest, which is now being pushed so
            thoroughly, extending its branches to our vast coal fields and to almost every
            accessible point necesssary for the convenient and rapid transportation of our
            agricultural products, would indeed be a disaster and a needless one. The Railroad
            interest and the interests of the people are identical; for neither can prosper without
            the aid and co-operation of the other. Laws made upon the basis or34 <pb n="530"
              xml:id="VAA8558-14-530"/> theory that the railroad companies are the enemies of the
            people will inevitably result in a conflict between the two and should carefully be
            avoided.</p>
          <p>It is true, that as railroad companies grow wealthy, they are apt to usurp power and
            become oppressive - and often manifest a disposition to disregard the enactments of so
            small an institution as a State Legislature - and it will be well to remind them that it
            is by the protection of law that they prosper, and they must submit to our laws if they
            would continue to prosper. Let us be sure that we make laws that are practicable and
            then we see that they are enforced.</p>
          <p>I come now to consider the proposition before the House, viz: the reconsideration of
            Senate bill No. 6 - and I will say at the out set that I am opposed to this bill for two
            particular reasons:</p>
          <p>First. That it is wholly impracticable.</p>
          <p>Second. That if it should become a law, and could be enforced, it would result in great
            injury rather than benefit to the ship-ing interest of the State. I will now give you my
            reasons for my belief, as briefly and intelligently as I can.</p>
          <p>There are two kinds of freight known to shippers - one is designated local tariff and
            the other is called through tariff. Local tariff is the price charged for shipping all
            classes of merchandise to local or intermediate points - usually short distances and
            generally small quantities - and the price does not fluctuate but remains the same
            throughout the year, and often many years without change; while through tariff is the
            price charged for transporting freight from one great commercial center to another or
            from a local or intermediate station to a through point or vice versa. Through tariff
            differs from local tariff in two ways: it is cheaper because the freight is usually
            carried a long distance and generally in car load quaniities. It also fluctuates often
            during the yearso much so that the price is quoted in our market reports the same as the
            price of grain, stock or merchandize. The weather, the amount of business, and
            competition, regulate the price of the through tariff.</p>
          <p>Now, sir, the bill under consideration proposes to cheapen the local tariff by
            requiring railroad companies to regulate their local tariff by their through tariff, or,
            in other words, require them to carry local freight for the same rate per mile, as
            through freight with the addition of fifty to one hundred per cent. as per distance.
            This, of course, would subject the local tariff to the same changes or fluctuations as
            the through tariff, which would seem impracticable.</p>
          <p>Again: suppose the railroad companies should establish a rate of freight to the State
            line sufficiently high to retain their existing schedules of local tariff. The result
            would be that it would not only defeat the intention of this bill, but, it would compel
            our shippers to pay the excessive charges to the State line, from which, if it should
            happen to be a competing point they would get lower rates, if not, they would have to
            pay local rates until they did reach a competing point; thereby sacrificing what I
            believe to be the true interest of the people, viz: the transportation of through
            freight.</p>
          <p>The member from Jasper and Newton [Mr. Hatch] says the railroad companies in his
            district charge the price of two bushels of corn for transporting one to market.
            Admitting this to be true, what relief, I ask, would the people of Jasper and Newton
            find in Senate bill No. 6, even should their most sanguine expectations be realized and
            local freights be reduced one hundred per cent. Do the people of those counties find a
            market for their corn at the local points along the line of their railroads? if so,
            their resources are not as great as I supposed. I think if you should go to New York,
            Philadelphia, or Boston, or any of the great sea board markets of the country, you will
            see hundreds of cars laden with golden grain, bearing the unmistakeable impress of the
            counties of Jasper and Newton; consequently those counties want cheap through freights
            and this bill would afford them no relief.</p>
          <p>Again; should this bill become a law, while it would not materially effect the great
            trunk lines that pass through our State it would bankrupt many of the local north and
            south roads, whose lines are wholly within our borders and who depend solely upon local
            freights and travel for their support. To illustrate, take the road from Indianapolis to
            Louisville, they charge for carrying one hundred barrels of flour the whole distance,
            one hundred miles, twenty-five dollars ; which would be twenty-five cents per mile for a
            car load. For a distance of ten miles - on the basis of the proposed bill they could
            only charge two dollars and a half with one hundred per cent, added, making five dollars
            for transporting one hundred barrels of flour a distance of ten miles, a portion of
            which would have to be paid for loading and unloading. You can readily see that this
            price would not pay expenses even.</p>
          <p>Now what would be their remedy under the proposed bill to make the local freight pay,
            they would have to charge for the whole distance fifty or sixty dollars; which would be
            disastrous to the people of Indianapolis, while on the other hand if they retained the
            low through freight, the price of local freight on their line would bankrupt them The
            same may be said of most all the north and south roads in the State to a greater or less
              <pb n="531" xml:id="VAA8558-14-531"/>degree, from the fact that under our Constitution
            we cannot classify the railroads, it I would be impossible to make a law on the basis of
            Senate bill No. 6, that would not do great injustice to some of the roads and the
            injustice will unavoidably fall upon roads that we would most desire to protect and
            assist.</p>
          <p>I will call your attention to one or two more of the wise provisions of this bill.
            Commencing at line fourteen of section four, you find the following:</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="blockquote">"Any station or freight agent of any railroad company at any
              station thereof in this State who shall fail to post up or keep posted up at his
              station such full, true, and accurate schedule as hereby required, shall be deemed
              guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction thereof, shall be fined twenty-five dollars
              for each and every offense, and in case of such failure to keep posted up such
              schedule at every station, each day of each failure shall be deemed and adjudged a
              separate offense."</hi>
          </p>
          <p>As the schedule would have to be changed every time the through rates are changed - and
            the through rates are sometimes changed from three to five times per month, the agent
            would have to have pretty good wages or his fines would exceed his salary. The injustice
            and impracticability of this section are certainly apparent without further comment ;
            however, I will say that in my opinion it is fully par with the rest of the bill.</p>
          <p>The member from Hancock [Mr. Offutt] has submitted an amendment which demands some
            attention. It is called section nine and provides as follows:"</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="blockquote">Whenever one shipper or a company engaged in buying and shipping,
              etc , require a car or cars to be set on the side track, he shall pay five dollars per
              car for every day said car or cars shall remain there unused."</hi>
          </p>
          <p>This provision would, in many cases, be hard and unjust to the shipper, and more, I
            believe than has ever been demanded by the railroad companias. All delays occuring under
            this provision would be put upon the way bill and collected with the freight without any
            trouble or expense whatever to the railroad company.</p>
          <p>Another provision in the same section is as follows:</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="blockquote">"If the railroad companies do not furnish said car or cars within
              a reasonable time they must pay ten dollars per car for each days delay
              thereafter."</hi>
          </p>
          <p>Railroad companies should be held responsible for unreasonable delay in furnishing
            cars, but the amount should be regulated by the damage sustained, and not fixed at a
            mere nominal sum. Delays often occur where no damage is sustained and again where it
            will amount to hundreds or even thousands of dollars, the facts should determine the
            award.</p>
          <p>I come now to consider the provisions of bill No. 115. This bill while it does not
            fully meet my views, is I think, the true basis of Legislation upon this subject, and
            with a few amendments will make a good law. It recognizes the fact that while we cannot
            classify the railroads of the State and establish a uniform rate to be charged for the
            transportation of freight, yet no railroad should be allowed to charge unreasonable
            rates, and in adjudging what a reasonable rate is, the kind of freight and the distance
            shall be taken into consideration. It provides that protests may be made and proven by
            parol evidence against paying an exorbitant price for transportation of any kind of
            goods or merchandize. It also provides that while railroad companies may regulate the
            prices charged for transporting through freight, they shall not establish those rates at
            the expense of the local or intermediate points along their lines. That is they shall
            not ship from competing points for a less rate of freight than from any other station of
            a less distance on the line of their roads.</p>
          <p>This provision is a very important one and will be recived with great satisfaction by
            the shippers from local points throughout the state. It will give the intermediate or
            way station the advantage of the competition at the central points thereby making them
            good markets, build them up and develop the resources of the surrounding country. The
            rule has been (though of course, there are exceptions) to make the price of
            transportation very low from competing points, such as St. Louis, Chicago and
            Indianapolis, and very high from local points where there is no competition; thereby
            virtually compelling the persons who do not happen to live where they can market their
            grain at a competing point to pay a portion of the freight of their more fortunate
            neghbors; for illustration, I will say that from here to Louisville you can ship a
            barrel of flour for twenty-five cents, while from Edinburg, one half the distance, you
            will have to pay forty cents. This is an unjust discrimination and is enforced by
            railroad companies only at stations where there is no competition. Our bill will correct
            this evil by requiring the railroad companies to carry the freight from Edinburg and all
            other stations along their road as cheap as they do from Indianapolis, thereby making
            the local points just as good markets for their grain - so far as transportation is
            concerned - as Indianapolis, which I think, is as much as they should ask in this
            direction. Railroad companies should do this without compulsion, for it tends to develop
            the resources and increase the products for transportation where they have exclusive
            jurisdiction.</p>
          <p>Again, section three of this bill require the railroad companies to carry our freight,
            when offered in car load quantities within a <pb n="532" xml:id="VAA8558-14-532"/>
            reasonable time and upon their failure or refusal to do so they may be compelled to pay
            double amount of damages sustained by the delay. This is a wise provision and will be of
            great service to our shippers from local or intermediate stations, who are often
            compelled to hold their grain or other merchandise at great loss, for the railroad
            companies knowing that they have a sure thing of the freight at these places will always
            furnish cars first at points where there is competition, and they are likely to lose
            part of the freight if cars are not promptly on hand.</p>
          <p>Now, Mr. Speaker, I have said about all I desire to upon that question. My conclusions
            are formed from long experience as a shipper and I believe the House - after due
            consideration - will agree with me that Senate bill No. 6, is not the kind of
            Legislation that the people demand at this time and that it should, therefore, not be
            reconsidered.</p>
          <p>While with Senate bill 115 as a State law and some general legislation by Congress
            embracing the same principle so far as continuous lines are concerned, and preventing
            combinations and consolidations to the detriment of the people will I believe
            effectually protect the interest of the people throughout the country.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. Mr. Speaker. I do not rise for the purpose of making a speech, but for the
            purpose of making an explanation which I think is due to myself and the House, and that
            is this: I did not say one word about the Senate bill No. 6, till the friends of that
            bill wished to have the amendments engrossed Then believing its friends had perfected it
            as far as they desired - believing this I got the floor and moved to lay that bill on
            the table, in order to give the friends of the Senate bill No. 115 the privilege of
            perfecting that. But it seems that motion was misunderstood.</p>
          <p>The thing I want to submit to the friends of the bill 115 is, that the Committee made
            their report on it so as to allow them to make it as nearly perfect as they can. Then it
            will be right and proper for the House to decide when we will take it up. I hope the
            gentleman from Park will withdraw the motion to reconsider the vote on my motion for the
            purpose of allowing us to take up the bill 115.</p>
          <p>Mr. OFFUTT. It seems to me that the House should not pass an act that will prove a mere
            farce.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. It is not my purpose to discuss the merits of the bill; but I wish to say
            to the gentleman and to the House, that notwithstanding their denunciations of the bill
            115, it has been examined by the ablest attorneys of the State not in the employ of the
            railroads. What I ask is, for the House to allow the friends of the bill 115 to have the
            same opportunity for its general consideration and amendment which the friends of the
            Senate bill No. 6 have had.</p>
          <p>Mr. WALKER. I hope the gentleman from Parke will not withdraw his motion. The gentleman
            from Jefferson thinks that will afford no opportunity for the friends of the bill 115 to
            perfect. But the Railroad Committee are friendly to the bill 115; and they have
            considered it, perfected it, and presented it as their bill.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. But the House has not acted on their report.</p>
          <p>Mr. WALKER. The gentleman misapprehends the condition of bill 115. Did not the Chair
            decide the amendment of the gentleman from Decatur [Mr. Miller] to be out of order,
            because that bill was not before the House? The gentleman has submitted his remarks in
            the premises, and the question on the motion to lay on the table is not debateable. I
            believe it would be the wisest thing the House can do now, to reconsider the vote of
            yesterday, and them recommit both these bills to the <orgName>Committee on the
              Judiciary</orgName>; and as a member of that Committee, I am willing to say to the
            House that they will give the subject their first consideration: and every section and
            every line ought to be examined carefully in the light of the Constitution and as to its
            effect on the people. I do believe, sir, that this discussion has done good. Many good
            suggestions have been submitted, which the Committee can weigh and consider. I think
            this reference would be practicable; and gentlemen cannot understand it as an effort to
            kill either bill.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. Have not a majority of that Committee already committed themselves to this
            bill and pronounced the bill 115 a mere collection of glittering generalities?</p>
          <p>Mr. WALKER. If the interrogation were limited to the chairman of the Committee, I would
            answer it in the affirmative; but I qualified my remark by saying that section seven has
            merits. And I will say now, that, if it is the sense of the House to pass the bill 115,
            I will give it my support with some amendments. I am not materially wedded to the Senate
            bill No. 6. - The suggestions that have been submitted by the gentleman from Kosciusko
            [Mr. Thayer] will be duly considered by the committee; and some of the suggestions that
            came from the gentleman from Ripley will be remembered by all.</p>
          <p>I will say again, that I am not unalterably opposed to Senate bill 115. I am willing to
            reconsider by own position ; and I think we all might be enabled to do so from what has
            been brought out in this discussion. I am free to admit that there is manifest inequity
            and inequality in some of the sections of the <pb n="533" xml:id="VAA8558-14-533"/>
            Senate bill No. 6; and the House cannot expect the return of those sections in the bill
            with the sanction of the Committee.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. When can the gentleman agree to report the bill back?</p>
          <p>Mr. WALKER. The first night we can get together will be Monday night. We can return it,
            I have no doubt, on Tuesday morning.</p>
          <p>A VOICE. "That will be too soon."</p>
          <p>Mr. KING. If the motion to recommit prevails, I hope the <orgName>Railroad
              Committee</orgName> will be joined with the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> on
            the consideration of these bills.</p>
          <p>Mr. WALKER. I should be glad to be associated with that Committee. I would be very
            glad: and I now invite the co-operation of that Committee.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRANHAM. Then I hope the House will agree to the motion.</p>
          <p>Mr. OFFUTT. I am perfectly willing to vote for the suggestion.</p>
          <p>Mr. MELLETT. The motion was to amend the motion to reconsider so as to make it a motion
            to refer both bills to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> with instructions to
            report next Wednesday.</p>
          <p>Mr. WALKER. I believe the matter ought to be in the hands of the <orgName>Judiciary
              Committee</orgName>. - The <orgName>Railroad Committee</orgName> to meet with us and
            we report on the bills.</p>
          <p>Mr. KING. I move to make the two a joint committee for this work.</p>
          <p>Mr. SMITH. I do not think it would be unfair to refer the matter to the
              <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>.Mr. KING. It seems to me, if the bill is to be
            recommitted, it should be referred to same Committee that reported it.</p>
          <p>Mr. GIVAN. Mr Speaker, can you refer any matter to two Committees by the same
            action?</p>
          <p>Mr. WALKER. My motion was to refer the matter to the <orgName>Judiciary
              Committee</orgName> - the <orgName>Railroad Committee</orgName> to meet with us.</p>
          <p>The SPEAKER. That is the understanding of the House.</p>
          <p>And accordingly, by unanimous consent, the two bills were referred to the Committee on
            the Judiciary.</p>

          <p>Pending the roll call on the passage of the Joint Committee's bill [S. 238] for an act
            redistricting the State for Judicial purposes to abolish the Court of Common Pleas,
            etc., - </p>
          <p>Mr. BIRD, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said: I wish to say
            this: I understand that this bill proposes to abolish the Common Pleas Courts in this
            State. It seems to me this is rather an untimely measure, and has not been as well
            matured as it ought to be. I am not prepared to vote for this bill and will have to vote
            against it. I vote "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. BOONE, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said. I am not in favor
            of this bill at all. There are several reasons why I shall vote against it. One is that
            it proposes to abolish a court that has been in operation in this State for over twenty
            years. The satisfaction it gave depended upon the character of the judge that held the
            office. In the districts where they have good judges the courts are good and where the
            judges are poor the courts are inferior. In some circuits the circuit judges have had to
            be removed, but I do not know of any case in which a Common Pleas judge has been
            removed. Now it is argued that we will get a better class of judges for having them all
            circuit. That may be the opinion of gentlemen who reside where they have a good circuit
            and a poor common pleas judge; but it is not so plausable to a man who lives in a
            district where there is a fine common Pleas judge and a poor circuit judge. Another
            reason why I cannot vote for thia bill is that if you abolish this court I do not know
            what you will put in the place of it. And another objection is that it requires
            versatility of talent for a man to perform the duties required of him under this bill
            than if the business were divided. I vote "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. COLLETT, in explanation of hia vote, when his name was called said: I vote against
            this bill for several reasons, we have good courts of Common Pleas and good Circuit
            judges in our district, and we don't care about bettering them. But I protest most
            earnestly against being compelled to have eight sittings of the same court in Vermillion
            and Parke counties as I understand the reading of the bill by the clerk. I vote
            "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. DAGGY, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: That a good many
            provisions in this bill would be good I have no doubt, but I have a suspicion that we
            will leave a great many matters without any jurisdiction whatever. I don't think the
            bill meets the purposes intended. I vote "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. DAUGHERTY, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: It <pb
              n="535" xml:id="VAA8558-14-535"/> seems to me we are proposing to make most too
            radical a change. I don't know of a State that does their legal business in one court.
            Not being satisfactorily posted I think it safest to vote against the bill. I vote
            "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. GOODING, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: It is
            universally conceded that the labors of the different judges of the State are unequally
            divided at the present time, and that we need a redistricting of the State for Court
            purposes. That is conceeded on all hands, and I think this bill meets that point. We
            have endeavored to get it up as equally as we know how. Unless this bill passes, I
            believe there will be no general redistricting of the State and I am satisfied unless
            there is a general redistricting there will be no raising of the salaries of the judges.
            Then our Common Pleas Judges will not get any more than they are receiving now, and a
            number of our best Circuit Judges will send in their resignations as soon as this
            Legislature adjourns. Many of them were only induced to take the bench with the idea of
            increased salaries. For one I shall vote for an increase of salaries whether this bill
            passes or not. One reason why I am in favor of the passage of this bill is that it
            divides the labor pretty nearly equal among the judges, increases their alaries and
            thereby retains on the bench good men. I say by the passage of this bill we will prevent
            the resignation of a number of the best judges on the bench. There are other reasons why
            I am in favor of the bill but as my time is about up, I will vote "aye."</p>
          <p>Mr. GREGG, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: Our common pleas
            judge is one of the finest judges in the State, and I know if the salary is not
            increased that he will not remain on the bench. I believe he will find his way on
            Circuit bench where his talents will we used for the good of the State. I think if we
            don't pass this bill the Legislature will adjourn without increasing the Common Pleas
            judges salaries, therefore I vote "aye."</p>
          <p>Mr. HOUGH, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said : I doubt
            exceedingly the principle involved in this bill, and I have reasons why I shall vote
            against it aside from that. The Common Pleas Court has been in existence twenty years
            and until recently we have heard no. objections to it. It will be necessary if that
            court be abolished that something should take the place of it. In five years or probably
            three years, we will not be without another court with jurisdiction inferior to that of
            the Circuit court. Why not continue the Common Pleas, modify the jurisdiction of the
            Court and equalize the labors of the judges. We can do that and still call it a court of
            Common Pleas as well as anything else. This bill has been thrown out for our votes
            without giving members an opportunity to perfect it. It will reduce the time in my
            county from fourteen to eight weeks, and with the present amount of time we are unable
            to transact the business without additional special terms ; and it will be nothing but
            an outrage upon the people of my county if this bill passes ; and I cannot sit quietly
            by and see it done without rebuking it. I think the Senate ought to have too high a
            regard for any portion of the State, than to willfully do anything of that kind. There
            is another provision which ought to be added to remove a difficulty like thin: our
            present circuit judge was elected judge of the seventh Judicial Circuit; by this bill
            his district would be the eighteenth: now can he be elected judge of the seventh,
            perform the duties of the judge of the eighteenth without a provision in this bill
            making him judge of the circuit he now resides in ?</p>
          <p>Mr. GLESSNER (interposing.) There is that sort of a provision in the bill.</p>
          <p>Mr. HOUGH (continuing.) For the reasons I have given, I could not without insulting my
            constituents vote for this bill, and I think if the Senate shall pass this bill it will
            be inflicting an outrage upon my people. I vote "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. HUBBARD, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: I shall vote
            for this bill because I believe it to be a step in the right direction. Little by little
            the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas Court has crept up until it has become a court of
            almost concurrent jurisdiction with the Circuit Court; and, substantially, this bill
            makes the Circuit Court, what the Common Pleas Court is in this State; and requiring for
            a judge a person of that versability of talent necessary to try breach of promises for
            marriage, libel and slander suits. These are the only new matters thrown into the
            Circuit Court under this bill. I have been somewhat anxious about this bill, as perhaps
            some Senators understand. In the northern part of the State there are large circuits and
            smaller Common Pleas districts. In my own county with five terms of the court we are no
            better off than we would be with three, for the reason that one immediately follows or
            preceeds the other in every case, filling the dockets of one term and leaving the
            preceeding one comparatively empty. It rights itself in time, but results in
            continuance.</p>
          <p>As far as the redistricting question is concerned, it seems to me the Senate has done
            as much with this bill as with any considered this session. It has lain in a painted
            form on the table of senators for weeks. It was sent to a committee of thirteen - one
            from each Congressional District - with the object <pb n="536" xml:id="VAA8558-14-536"/>
            of reconciling differences by having on the committee one representative from each
            district; and if senators sit quietly in their seats I and only fine out on the third
            reading that It outrages their constituents, the fault is with them not with those who
            vote for this bill, I vote "aye."</p>
          <p>Mr. SCOTT, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I vote "no." I
            listened carefully to the reading of this engrossed bill and my county is in two
            circuits; it is in a circuit by itself, with which I would be content. If that were all
            I would vote for the bill at once, but it is in a circuit also with Sullivan county.
            That being the case it seems to me I ought not to vote for it.</p>
          <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Brown in the chair.] The bill has not been actually
            engrossed at all. The Senator from St. Joseph [Mr. Hubbard] moved to consider the bill
            as engrossed; and one clerk has been reading from one bill and another from another, and
            that is the cause of the trouble the clerks have had in reading; and so it is that the
            Senator heard what he did.</p>
          <p>Mr. SCOTT. I have no censure for the clerks, but as I understand that Sullivan and Vigo
            counties are together in one district, of course I am opposed to that and I vote "no,"
            otherwise I would vote "aye."</p>
          <p>Mr. SLATER, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: I do not think
            this bill will accomplish the result desired, and if left to my personal inclanation I
            should vote against the bill but my constituents are unanimously in favor of the bill
            and therefore vote "aye."</p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I could not
            vote for the bill, even if I was personally disposed to do so because I am instructed by
            every lawyer of the county of Rush, except one, [the Lieutenant Governor,] and every
            member of the bar of Decatur county, to vote against the bill. One reason why I vote
            against the bill is this: The counties of Rush and Decatur have been together for many
            years - twelve or fifteen years - for judicial purposes, they have been in the same
            Common Pleas district, the same Senatorial district, the same Legislative district and
            the game Congressional district. This bill proposes to take Decatur from this district
            and put it with the county of Franklin, with which it has nothing in common. Franklin
            and Decatur have nothing whatever in common, and they never have had.</p>
          <p>Another reason for my opposition to the bill is that it does not equalize the labor of
            the judges. In the district assigned to us the Judge will only be required to sit about
            twenty-two weeks out ot the fifty-two in the year; Now the friends of this bill say one
            of the most important features is to equalize the labor of the districts. That is
            redistricting with avengence, when a judge paid for fifty-two weeks labor is only called
            upon to sit twenty-two weeks. In the counties of Rush, Fayette and Union, the entire
            time occupied at present by the Common Pleas and district courts only amounts to
            twenty-two weeks, while upon the other hand by this bill Dearborn county is taken from
            Franklin county and Decatur is added on to Franklin county. Now the average population
            of a district throughout the State is nine thousand nine hundred and seventy. That is
            the average population for a judicial district. This district is made up for the
            accommodation of some one, I presume, for certainly it is not made up upon the
            principles of reason.</p>
          <p>The new circuit composed of Dearborn and Ohio, has a voting population of six thousand
            six hundred and sixty-one, while the average circuit, as constituted by the bill, has a
            voting population of nine thousand nine hundred and seventy. Some districts, under this
            bill, run as low as five thousand in population - this bill that is to equalize the
            population, while others run up to fifteen thousand. Some have three times the
            population that others have. I submit that is not redistricting. Another reason why I am
            compelled to vote against this bill is it provides for thirty-eight circuit judges. It
            is admitted by all parties that this is a step in the right direction, and is to be
            follow by some other step as a substitute for the present Common Pleas courts to take
            the Probate business from the hands of the circuit court. If they take away a part of
            the labor that is now entrusted to Circuit courts then the number of the Circuit courts
            should be diminished. But Senators will reccollect that the Legislature has no power
            under the Constitution, to legislate out of office a Circuit Judge. The number that we
            fix to-day we have no power to legislate out of office, so that when we come to
            establish the other court that is proposed to be established and divide the labor
            between the Circuit Judges and the county Surrogates, we will be in the same condition
            that we are now: We shall have too many judges and we will find it will be the most
            expensive system we have ever had in the State. For these and other reasons I have not
            time to give. I vote against the bill. I vote "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. SMITH, in explanation of his vote when his name was called said: I am ready to vote
            for a bill just in its provisions but I insist that a court which has stood for twenty
            years should not be ruthlessly thrown aside without getting a better system to take the
            place of it. I vote "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. STEELE, when his name was called in explanation of his vote said: This bill would
            create thirty-seven circuits, and it is <pb n="537" xml:id="VAA8558-14-537"/> proposed
            to pay the judges three thousand dollars each, which will amount to one hundred and
            eleven thousand dollars a year. That is one step to be taken in the way of reform. In
            addition to that one step the next step will be to form something like a Surrogate
            system, with a Surrogate for each county at about one thousand dollars a year, which
            will be ninety-two thousand dollars more making two hundred and three thousand dollars a
            year for the Judicary. The present Circuit Judges cost fifty-three thousand dollars, and
            Common Pleas Judges thirty-three thousand dollars or eighty-six thousand dollars in all.
            It is proposed now to have thirty-seven judges and give them one hundred and eleven
            thousand dollars a year. This is what is called reform. Take the eighty-six thousand
            dollars you are now paying your circuit and Common Pleas Judges and you have twenty-five
            thousand dollars from the one hundred and eleven thousand dollars that the circuit
            judges you are creating will receive. Gentlemen say they are only taking the initial
            step but before we take that step - before we involve ourselves with thirty-seven Judges
            I want to know what is back. I vote "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. THOMPSON, when his name was tolled; in explanation of his vote, said: The old
            lawyers of our county generally favor this bill while the young lawyers I think a great
            many of them are opposed to it. I suppose I ought to bow to the judgment of old age so I
            shall vote for the bill "aye."</p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said : I have
            very little personal knowledge with regard to the merits of this bill having been
            fortunate enough never to have to enter a Court House in the State of Indiana. In my
            district I don't know of a single legal gentleman who is in favor of the passage of this
            bill, while on the contrary my desk is full of letters protesting against its passage. I
            am satisfied there is no one in my portion of the State that favors it. I know both
            courts in Laporte county are not able to clear their dockets and old practitioners in
            that county are protesting against the passage of this bill. I trust it will not become
            a law. Mr. President I vote "no."</p>

          <p> On motion by Mr. DWIGGINS, Mr. Beardsley's bill [S. 245] - being the special order for
            this hour - To provide for letting the State printing to the lowest bidder and
            constitute the Governor, Secretary and Auditor of State a commission for that purpose
            the special order for 10:30, was taken up and read the second time, together with the
            amendments reccommended by the committee.</p>
          <p>Mr. BROWN opposed the passage of the bill. He said that in the first place, it provides
            for the appointment of a Superintendant of Public Printing at a salary of two thousand
            dollars per annum, who will not be employed more than forty days in the year. Second, it
            may result in the State printing being done in Cincinnati or Chicago. He thought it
            would be a sad commentary on the State, a State which boasts of its culture, of its
            improvement, of its learning, of its intelligance, its sciences, and its arts, if it has
            to send out to the young State of Illinois to get its public printing done. Next, he
            objected to the clause which provides for the purchase of the paper by the State. That
            is where all the trouble has come in, because some Public Printer has gone in with
            certain paper establishments and has had them fix the price of paper and had then
            divided the profit, perhaps, between the purchaser and the seller. This bill provides no
            remedy for that great evil. For these reasons among others he didn't like the bill in
            its present shape. He didn't think it safe for the Senate to act upon it, and he
            therefore moved to refer the bill and amendments to the <orgName>Committee on
              Judiciary</orgName>.</p>
          <p>Mr. SLATER said the bill had been carefully considered by the Committee on Public
            Printing and was carefully guarded in all its provisions. It has received the unanimous
            support of that committee. They have had it examined by practical printers: and it was
            guarded as well as any bill can possibly be. He hoped the motion would prevail.</p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH said that the number of amendmends showed that the committee had labored
            hard and had considered it carefully. The amendments are very numerous, and he was
            opposed to passing a bill in this shape until it had gone to a committee and the
            amendments had been inserted in the proper places. This bill has been twice before the
            committee. The firpt time a certain set of amendments were reported. It was afterwards
            with those amendments recommitted with instructions to report a bill of this character.
            The Committee overhauled the bill again and with this report submitted an additonal set
            of amendments; and they are very numerous. I must confess that I am rather suspicious
            about passing a bill in this shape. lam afraid we might make some slips unless the bill
            be returned again to the <pb n="539" xml:id="VAA8558-14-539"/> BREVIER LEGISLATIVE
            REPORTS.539committee so that the amendments may be placed in the appropriate places. I
            should not like to see any of their labors lost.</p>
          <p>Mr. GLESSNER, I am opposed to recommitting the bill for the simple reason that it is
            growing so late in the session. It is an important matter, and this proposition has been
            before the committee on Printing ever since the office of State Printer was abolished. I
            am informed by members of the committee that they have given it every attention that
            they have used every facility and taken advantage of every intelligent counsel that
            could be reached by the committee. These motions for delay all come from the enemies of
            the bill. To commit this bill is a step in the direction of murdering it and leaving us
            at the end of the session without any law whatever on the subject. My judgment is that
            the committee have done the very best that could be done under the instructions of the
            Senate, this committee went to work with a view of prefecting the bill; and I can see no
            reason at this late day of the session for recommitting the bill, and I believe it would
            be perilling its existence. I do not say that is the intention of gentlemen but it has
            that tendency. If this committee were to give one-tenth part of the attention to this
            bill that has been given it by the Committee on Printing there can be no report on it
            during this session of the Senate. Talk about it at this late day of the session
            referring this printing bill to another committee, when the Committee on Printing, ever
            since the beginning of the special session - seventy days ago, if not more than that
            have had this subject under consideration and now for the first time we are considering
            the report made by that Committee after this long consideration and careful
            preparation.</p>
          <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. Let the bill be engrossed and then we can learn what is in it. If any
            Senator can understand from the reading of the reports what there is in the bill, he is
            better able to comprehend it than I am, I move to lay the motion to refer on the
            table.</p>

            amendments almost and not a Senator on the floor knows where these amendments come in
            until such time as the bill is engrossed. I think we ought either to have this bill

          <p>Mr. BROWN, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: This bill was
            thrown on the Senate and not a single Senator could say that he knew anything about it.
            It may be, if the bill passed, that the State would suffer more inconvenience and loss
            than under the old law. He made the motion in order that the Senate might be properly
            informed in regard to its provisions, in order that Senators may vote intelligently, in
            order that they may know whether it is a bill for weal and not for woe.</p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: We ought to
            print this bill, and after it is printed we can consult with printers from our districts
            and elsewhere and in that way may save hundreds of thousands of dollars. The cost of
            printing amounts to nothing. I vote "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: This was a most
            important matter. There had probably been more stealing, or, perhaps as he ought to
            express it in the Senate, more "leakage" in this department of the State <pb n="540"
              xml:id="VAA8558-14-540"/> government than any other. He believed that he, as a member
            of the Printing Committee, understood this bill, but he thought the other Senators ought
            to have an opportunity to understand it also. As a member of that committee I am not
            disposed to legislate for this Senate, and I am not disposed to permit other committees
            to legislate for me. I desire to know what is in every bill before I vote for it, and I
            desire every member of the Senate to know what is in the bill and be responsible to his
            constituents; and therefore, in order that every Senator may know the provisions of this
            bill and vote understandingly upon it, I am in favor of printing the bill. It is a long
            and complicated bill and a man cannot sit down and read it and in one hour understand
            its provisions. I vote "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. STEELE, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I hope this
            bill will be printed. I do not know the provisions of the bill. There are so many
            amendments I think they ought to be submitted to the Senate so that members can look at
            them. If the bill was printed and laid on our tables we could take it home in the
            evening, read it carefully, correct any errors we may see, and be able to explain them
            to the Senate when we assemble again. In addition to that the bill can be printed by
            to-morrow eveningit can be ready by to-morrow evening - and I think we should have it on
            our table before we vote on it. No doubt the committee intend every thing for the best,
            but at the same time I would rather vote on my own judgment than on the judgment of any
            committee. I do hope the Senate will allow this bill to be printed, at least. I vote
            "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. THOMPSON, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: There never
            has been a bill presented in this Senate of more importance. I apprehend that not one
            man in ten who votes against the referring or printing of this bill understands
            one-tenths of the amendments proposed to it. The only point in the bill that inspires
            confidence seems to be the fact that it provides for a Superintendent. They put a
            Superintendent over the public printing office at Washington; and every Senator knows
            the result of that move. A Superintendent can be as dishonest as a public printer. I
            vote "no."</p>
          <p>When the roll call was completed - </p>
          <p>The vote was announced as above recorded.</p>
          <p>So the motion to print the bill [S. 245] to provide for letting the public printing to

          <p>The bill S. 245 (Mr. Beardley,s): To provide for the letting of the State printing to
            the lowest bidder, making the Governor, Secretary of State, and Auditer of State,
            Commissioners of Public Printing, and creating the office of Superintendent of Public
            Printing.</p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS moved to recommit the bill to the <orgName>Committee on Public
              Printing</orgName>, with instructions to amend by striking out all in reference to the
            State Printer and Superintendent of Printing and authorizing the purchase of the paper,
            and so amend that contractors shall furnish all material; also authorizing the State
            officers to call in whenever they see proper, an expert at an expense not exceeding six
            dollars per day, to measure work or consult with them. He said that under the Senate
            bill frauds will be possible exactly as under the law lately repealed, and if it is
            neccessary for the Commissioners of Public Printing to have a printer to consult why let
            them take one from Cincinnati, Chicago or from anywhere they think proper, one man this
            time an another the next so that he cannot be bought up. Why not let the contractors bid
            for the paper on which to do the work?</p>
          <p>Mr. BROWN moved to amend the motion so as to recommit with instructions to strike out
            all after the enacting clause, and insert House bill No 526. He said the Senate bill
            provided for the employment of a superintendent who has almost as unlimited sway over
            the affairs of the State as the State Printer had under the law lately repealed. The
            duties of his office will not engage him more than thirty-five or forty days a year and
            it is proposed by this bill to allow him two thousand dollars a year for that
            service.</p>
          <p>All the evils existing under the old law will be perpetual under this one. Again this
            bill makes the Board the contracting party for the purchase of paper, type, ink and
            other material, and there is where the trouble has always come in, by which the State
            has suffered in times past. There is nothing in the bill to protect the State in the
            slightest degree from that which is said to have been an evil in the State, that the
            Public Printer would contract at one price and turn the material over to the State at a
            higher price. He thought the best plan would be to let out the job with alll the
            material, paper, ink, type, printing, stitching and everything done. The bill that he
            proposed as a substitute simply provides that the job shall be let out to somebody, to
            be done as a whole just as one would contract for building a house with some responsible
            contractor.</p>
          <p>Mr. NEFF, said that the Republiban party stood pledged to the country to abolish the
            office of State Printer and it had redeemed that pledge. The reason of the <pb n="542"
              xml:id="VAA8558-14-542"/> pledge and of the action in accordance therewith was found
            in the corruption and found perpetrated on the State Treasury, We are now asked to
            devise a system that shall prevent similar frauds. I believe the Senate bill is nearer
            in accordance with the demands of the country, while I would prefer a slight change in
            this bill, not that I believe that the House bill which proposes to pay a superintendent
            six dollars per day would lessen the expense, I do not think it would. Still on its face
            it presents that appearance but as a whole I very much prefer the Senate bill as it is
            in accordance with the wishes of the people, with the spirit of ecomomy to let the
            printing to the lowest responsible bidder, with the right to reject any and all bids if
            they are deemed too high and against public policy. The Senate bill is not in the
            interest of any publishing ring while it is believed that the House bill is in such an
            interest, and that the six dollar per day claim is simply a little sugar coating to
            enable weak stomachs to swallow it.</p>
          <p>Mr. SLATER moved to lay both motions to amend on the table.</p>
          <p>On demand of Mr. Brown the question was divided and the vote was first taken on laying
            Mr. Brown's motion to recommit with instructions to substitute the House bill, on the

          <p>Pending the roll call.</p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: The bill now
            pending is certainly objectionable - worse than the old State Printing bill, and I think
            if the substitute of the Senator from Jackson [Mr. Brown] instead of providing for an
            expert, simply authorized the calling in of an expert, it would be a good bill. I would
            make that discretionary. I do hope the Senate will take no hasty action in this matter.
            If we are to have a superintendent of public printing why not call him the State
            Printer. I hope the Senate will be deliberate over this matter. I vote "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. GLESSNER, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said. It seems that
            in every argument addressed by Senators opposing this bill on its passage the only point
            they make against it is that this superintendent is a mere substitute for the old State
            Printer. Now I understand that this Superintendent is appointed by the State officers,
            and he is subject to removal at any time by the Board consisting of the State officers.
            This Superintendent has nothing to do whatever with buying the paper. It is bought by
            the Board of Supervisors. The objection of gentlemen is untenable and unreasonable. I
            therefore vote "aye."</p>
          <p>Mr. HARNEY, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said: I shall vote to
            lay the substitute on the table for the reason that the difficulty seems to have been in
            securing the services of honest men. There has been no objection to the State Printing
            system had it been conducted according to law. I see no reason for imposing these duties
            upon the State officers. It is unfair that officers loaded down with other duties should
            have put upon them the discharge of this delicate duty. I think there will be no
            difficulty in getting a superintendent honest enough to discharge the duties imposed
            upon him and for that reason I desire to see him well compensated. I vote "aye."</p>
          <p>Mr. HOUGH, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I don't believe
            you can better this bill. It is the result of a great deal of labor on the part of the
              <orgName>Committee on Printing</orgName>. I do hope the Senate will not allow any
            charge of having delayed this thing for the purpose of creating a fat job for the
            Journal or any other printing Company.</p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS (interposing.) How can anybody get a job if there is no authority to let
            it?</p>
          <p>Mr. HOUGH. I don't know the secrets of this thing.</p>
          <p>Mr. BROWN (interposing.) The Senator has said it is charged that the Committee on
            Public Printing has been keeping this bill back for a purpose. Where is the charge
            made?</p>
          <p>Mr. HOUGH. In one of the public journals of this city.</p>
          <p>Mr. BROWN. The Senator has said it is charged that the Committee on Public Printing has
            kept this thing back for the purpose of giving the Journal Csmpany a fat job. In point
            of fact, sir, I say the charge is not true, let it come from whence it does.</p>
          <p>Mr. HOUGH (resuming.) The Senator from Jackson [Mr. Brown] is not a member of that
            committee. I am; and I am glad to hear the gentleman say that the charge is not true
            because I know it is not true. But it has been intimated in the public journals that
            this bill was for a purpose, and delayed intentionally to give a fat job to somebody.
            The charge may perhaps be made with some foundation if distinguished Senators oppose a
            bill of this character which guards the public treasury at all <pb n="543"
              xml:id="VAA8558-14-543"/> points; and by delaying it results in no action of the
            Senate at all.</p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS (interposing.) Do you intimate that the members who are opposing the bill
            are in the interest of the Journal Company?</p>
          <p>Mr. HOUGH. I repeat that if this thing ia delayed there might be some foundation for
            such a charge in the future, and I say it knowing what I am talking about. I'd like for
            gentlemen to take up this bill section by section and point out wherein it fails to
            guard the public treasury. The people expect this as one of the things we should do, and
            each party expects something should be done for the relief of the people and the
            salvation of their pecuniary interests in regard to the public printing. I vote to lay
            the proposed amendments on the table for the reason that I think their adoption would
            result in no good to the people, and would not secure one cent that the enactment of
            this bill would not secure.</p>
          <p>Mr. STEELE, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said : I am in favor
            of the substitute, although I see by the vote that it is lost. I know this is not the
            proper place or the time to debate the question, but I would like much to compare the
            substitute with the original bill. Mr. S. then took up the substitute and read it
            section by section, comparing it with the Senate bill to show that it more carefully
            guarded the interests of the people than the latter.When the roll call was completed - </p>
          <p>The vote was announced as above recorded.</p>
          <p>So the substitute amendment [Mr.Brown's] was laid on the table.</p>
          <p>The question then recurring on laying on the table Mr. Dwiggins' motion to recommit the
            bill with instructions, the yeas and nays were demanded and being ordered and taken
            resulted - yeas 34, nays 12 - as follows:</p>

          <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS, explaining his vote, when his name was called, said: I was opposed to the
            bill for several reasons. In the first place, the Superintendent of Public Priating
            would not be employed more than one to three months in the year, yet you pay him four
            thousand dollars a year or one thousand dollars a month. In reference to the purchase of
            the paper, it is insisted that the Governor, Auditor, etc., can purchase this paper as
            cheap as any other way. Yet sir, that is to be done at private sale. There is no
            competition. They go to the stationery house and buy paper, and thus the Superintendent
            will do the whole thing - the Superintendent will do all the purchasing. Neither is
            there any requirement that bids shall be solicited.</p>
          <p>Again, the bill provides that the price for rule and figure work shall be double what
            it is for plain work. Printers have only to make a combination on plain work, and then
            the bill provides that they shall have double as much for figure work. The Senator from
            Hancock [Mr. Hough] says if this bill fails there will be ground for saying that it is
            in the interest of the Journal Company ; yet the Senator votes for a bill that proposes
            to give the Superintendent two thousand dollars a year. The Senator says everything is
            provided to let the whole out to the lowest bidder. I say that is not so. Parties are
            not allowed to put in bids for figure work separately, as you do for plain work. Under
            the bill a man who wishes to put in a bid for figure work and nothing else, is barred. I
            suppose this bill is in the interest of the Printers' Union - that it is to dictate to
            this Senate what laws shall be passed here relative to the printing of the State. I do
            not know anything about Printers' Unions. I presume they are composed of honorable men,
            but I undertake to say that no class of men ought to dictate to the Legislature what
            bill it should pass. Mark my word, if this bill becomes a law, the people will be more
            dissatisfied in two years than they have been heretofore with the State Printer, because
            the same swindles can be perpetrated under it as under the original law. I vote
            "no."</p>
          <p>When the roll call was completed - </p>
          <p>The vote was announced as above recorded.</p>
          <p>So the motion to recommit was laid on the table.</p>
          <p>Mr. BROWN moved to committ the bill to the <orgName>committee on Judiciary</orgName>,
            with instructions to so amend that the contracts shall not be let to non-residents of
            the State nor the work done out of the State. He said the Board under this bill has a
            discretionary power with reference to letting the printing, because when you say "the
            lowest responsible bidder" that relieves the Board from the necessity of letting it to
            the lowest bidder, but they can let it to the bidder who is in the opinion of the Board
            the responsible bidder. Now I am not economical to the extent that I would require a
            printing establishment in this State to conform their prices to the prices some other
            printing establishments in the United States would do the work for. There are some <pb
              n="544" xml:id="VAA8558-14-544"/> twenty or twenty-five establishments in this State
            conpetent to perform the public printing for the State, but I do think these
            establishments can not perform the work as cheap as some of the mammoth establishments
            in the city of New York, and probably in Cincinnati where they have so much greater
            business to conduct and where they have so much greater opportunities of buying material
            and do not have to pay the cost of transportation. The work would be more cheaply done,
            perhaps, in New York than in Indianapolis, New Allbany, Madison, Terre Haute, South
            Bend, Fort Wayne, Lafayette or Evansville, but I am not so hide bound that I would
            compel home establishments to conform their prices to establishments in New York
            city.</p>
          <p>Mr. HOUGH. I am one of those who believe that corporations, political or otherwise have
            the right to go into the market and purchase as cheaply as they can; and I believe it
            our duty to get for the use of the State what we can at the fairest price, and I am not
            so hide bound and sectional as to undertake to prohibit workmen from other States
            competing with men in our State. I believe it our duty in making provision for work to
            be done for the public, to open competition to the world and make men responsible if
            they contract to do it. I do not know any rule by which I am authorized to be more
            liberal with the people's money than with my own. Any Senator would get his work done by
            the lowest responsible bidder. I hope the time will never come when my sympathies and
            feelings will be wrapt up by the boundaries of my State, but when acting for the State I
            will say that work shall be done by an Indiana man if he will do it as well or as low as
            any other man: but if a man in Ohio or New York will do as well and for a less price I
            would give it to him, and I think I would be acting under the obligation of an oath when
            I do that. I do not see anything in the amendments. I thought the day of sectionalism
            was about past. If a buckeye desires to do work for us, and will do it as well as a
            Hoosier, and will do our work cheaper it is our duty as representatives of these men who
            make the money to give it to him.</p>
          <p>Mr. STEELE. The speech of the gentleman sounds nicely. I suppose it is made for his
            constituents, the gentleman not intending an answer to go along with it. The proposition
            is that he is willing to do by the State precisely as he would do for himself. That is
            all well enough. This bill proposes to let the public printing of the State to the
            lowest responsible bidder; not the lowest responsible bidder in the State of Indiana,
            nor the lowest responsible bidder in the State of Ohio, nor the lowest responsible
            bidder in the State of Illinois, nor even in the United States of America. Then the
            argument of the gentleman is that if you can get the public printing done cheaper in New
            York than in the State of Indiana to go there and do it. That is the way he would do it
            himself. I submit the matter for the consideration of the Senate, what would we have, if
            for instance when bills are to be printed we should be informed that the public printer
            is in the city of New York - that the man engaged to do this work is not a resident of
            the State of Indiana; - and we are informed that the bill we want printed has to be sent
            to the city of New York. It is to be executed there by some gentleman who is to read the
            proof. You start a man to New York with the bill and before he geto back we want
            another, and another, and another; and every single item would have to be sent to the
            city of New York. I ask the gentleman whether this bill proposes to confine this
            printing to be done in the State of Indiana? I ask whether under this bill, the printing
            may not be done in the city of New Orleans, Mobile or Chicago? Is it not the bounden
            duty of the officers charged with that duty to get it done where it can be done the
            cheapest?</p>
          <p>I want to get our printing done, and I think it can be done in the State of Indiana as
            cheap as we should require it to be done. If we have to pay a little more to have it
            done in the State of Indiana than in New York, I am willing to do it. I do not think
            there is any necessity of going from this State to find an honest man. I think we have
            plenty of honest printers and printing establishments in the State of Indiana without
            going any farther. I hope the amendment will be agreed to.</p>
          <p>Mr. ORR. I am in favor of a change from the system heretofore in practice. I have no
            doubt from what I have learned on the subject of printing for the State, that there have
            been great impositions practiced on the State, and they ought to be corrected. I am in
            favor of letting the public printing out to the lowest responsible bidder - and that
            bidder a citizen, resident of our State, and the work all done in Indianapolis. I am an
            Indianian all over, and am decidedly in favor of Indiana doing her own public
            printing.</p>
          <p>The amendment was agreed to by consent.</p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS asked unanimous consent to have an amendment inserted striking put two
            thousand dollars a year, and providing for the allowance to the Superintendent of a sum
            not to exceed six dollars a day for the time necessarily and actually employed, <pb
              n="545" xml:id="VAA8558-14-545"/> the Board to examine and certify his accounts before
            they were paid.</p>
          <p>Consent was refused.</p>
          <p>Mr. BROWN moved to commit the bill to the <orgName>Committee on Judiciary</orgName>,
            with instructions to so amend as that contractors shall furnish all materials.</p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS moved to amend to recommit the bill, with instruction to insert his
            amendment and report within thirty minutes.</p>
          <p>Mr. FULLER demanded the previous question ; and there being a second - </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH called for a division of the question, and the vote was first taken on Mr.

          <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
          <p>Mr. BROWN, in explaining his vote, when his name was called, said: This bill provides
            for the employment of a Superintendent at a sslary of two thousand dollars, whose
            duties, it stands confessed, will not require his employment for more than forty days.
            That is one reason for voting against it. In the next place, it provides that the Board
            of Public Printing, in conjunction with the Superintendent, may purchase the paper, and
            if any dishonesty or fraud has been practiced by which the State has suffered by the
            management of the public printing, it has been by reason of the paper purchase. That is
            another reason. In the next place I believe that it is necessary that a proper law
            should be passed at this session upon the subject of the public printing. The House of
            representatives adheres to the bill that I offered as a substitute. It has just passed
            it I believe. That is another reason. Finally, if the House stands by that bill and the
            Senate stands by this bill, the result will be that both will fall to the ground, and we
            will have no law on the subject, and that is another reason why I shall vote "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I have but
            very little to add to what I have already said. I think there are some good provisions
            in this bill, and that with some amendments the bill might be a good law, but, as it is,
            many of its provisions are very pernicious. There is no sort of propriety in paying the
            Superintendent two thousand dollars a year for the reason that there is'nt a printing
            establishment in the State that pays its Superintendent anything like that price, when
            the superintendent is engaged every day it the week.</p>
          <p>Mr. SLATER (interposing.) The Sentinel office pays its Superintendent twenty-two
            hundred dollars.</p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. Every Senator must know that to do the State printing will require not to
            exceed one to three months in the year. What will there be for him to do in the year
            1874? Absolutely nothing. What will there be for him to do in the year 1873, after the
            acts and journals of the two Houses are published? Absolutely nothing. And yet he is to
            receive the sum of four thousand dollars for two years. A good Superintendent could be
            employed to do all the work that will be required at a cost not exceeding five hundred
            dollars. But it is claimed that you must have some man to read proof and do the
            measurement What proof will there be to read except the journals and acts. What is it
            worth to superintend the publishing of the journals and acts? Is it worth four thousand
            dollars? We are told we should let this work to the lowest responsible bidder, ond yet
            when I proposed to amend this bill so as to pay the Superintendent for the actual time
            he expends at the rate of six dollars per day the Senate refused to do it, and now is
            proposing to pay him four times - five times - yes several times what it is worth.</p>
          <p>I undertake to say that I can employ as good a Superintendent as there is in any
            establishment in the State at a cost not exceeding five hundred dollars. I am prepared
            to do that. Then why throw away three thousand five hundred dollars of the State's
            mon-35 <pb n="546" xml:id="VAA8558-14-546"/> ey when Senators say they are here to
            protect the public interests of the State? Why rush this bill through when it can be
            amended in thirty minutes ? Why not take that thirty minutes and save this money. I vote
            "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. GOODING, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I have been
            voting for most of the amendments. I think the bill needs amending, but in order that we
            may have a bill of some kind I intend to vote for this bill now, and if the House bill
            comes in I expect to vote for that. I vote "aye."</p>
          <p>Mr. HARNEY, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said: I vote for this
            bill not because I am familiar with its provisions but because it has been in the hands
            of a competent committee and I believe they have done their best to make it perfect.
            Besides I have noticed occasionally that where gentlemen were opposing a bill they are
            frequently found proposing amendments. This bill is as it came from the committee which
            has carefully examined it, therefore I vote "aye."</p>
          <p>Mr. ROSEBRUGH, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said : I don't
            think we can make this matter of the public printing any worse, therefore I vote "aye."
            [Laughter.]</p>
          <p>Mr. STEELE, when his name was called in explanation of his vote said: I don't think by
            this bill we can make the public printing matter any better, therefore I vote "no."</p>
          <p>When the roll call was completed - </p>
          <p>The vote was announced as above recorded.</p>
          <p>So the bill [S. 245] to provide for letting the public printing to the lowest bidder
            was passed the Senate.</p>

            <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS moved that the amendments be concurred in, and on that he moved the

            <p>A division being taken a demand, for the previous question was seconded, and the

            <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
            <p>Mr. NEFF, by way of explaning his vote when his name was called said that, when the
              bill was before the Senate he voted against it, because he was not certain how the bar
              of his county felt about the matter. Hiscounty had been added to Henry, and they had
              no connections with that county. But since the bill had gone into the House an
              amendment in accordance with the views of the bar of his county had been made, as he
              had urged it in the Senate, and he felt that his relations were changed to some
              extent, toward the bill as it comes from the House. If he were to represent his
              personal feelings he should vote against the bill even as it in. He was opposed to the
              abolition of the Common Pleas Courts, believeing that in two years from that time some
              other Court would necessarily be substituted in lieu of that court. But having been
              instructed by the entire bar of his county to vote for it if this amendment was made,
              he felt called upon to obey that instruction and he therefore voted "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. ORR, when his name was called in explanation of his vote, was understood to say
              that the bill was framed entirely contrary to his wishes, but being informed that it
              was amended in the House of Representatives just to accommodate him, as long as they
              were so accommodating as to do that he felt constrained to vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. RHODES in explanation of his vote when his name was called said: I am opposed to
              the main proposition in the bill - the abolishment of the Common Pleas Court. I do not
              believe that it will prove to be economy. I think before we get three or four years
              away from the action of to-day we will find that we have done one of the most
              expensive things as far as the Juiciary is concerned that we ever have done. We will
              be compelled to create some other court to manage and control the probate business of
              this State, and instead of doing an act economical and saving to the State this will
              be a measure of bad economy. I feel that my counties do not desire any change of thin
              sort. In fact both counties I represent have sent up petitions here against the
              passage of this bill because they are opposed to the abolishment of the Common Pleas
              Court. I vote "no.".</p>
            <p>Mr. RINGO, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: When this bill
              was before the Senate a few days ago, I voted against it; and I voted then as much
              perhaps, against my will in so doing as any thing I have voted on during this session
              of the Senate. I came here instructed by a large portion, I think I may safely say, of
              the people of my district to vote for almost anything to abolish the Common Pleas
              Court. But we didn't get our district as we wanted it, and consequently I voted
              against the bill. Since it went to the House of Representatives they have amended it a
              little, and I feel a little better satisfied with it. I shall vote for the bill now,
              or rather for concnr- <pb n="547" xml:id="VAA8558-14-547"/>rence in the House
              amendments. I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN, in explanation of his vote when his name was called said: After the
              amendments to this bill passed by the other House I am compelled to vote against it. I
              vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. SMITH, in explanation of his vote when his name was called said: I do not believe
              this is a step in the right direction. It was said when we were making up the fee bill
              that we were taking a step in the right direction, but it seems to me that we are
              going back; and that we will live to see the day when this Senate will be glad to
              restore the Common Pleas Court. I vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said : I am opposed
              to the abolishment of the Common Pleas Court, but had I even been in favor of it after
              the action taken on this bill I should not vote for it. It was put through under the
              gag rule from the moment the first step was taken in the House, and it passed here
              really without the majority it should have. The vote was announced while a Senator was
              rising in his seat and wanting to change his vote - after finding out his mistake he
              was asking to have his vote changed. It is sent over to the House of Representatives
              and we are told here by the gentleman from Delaware [Mr. Orr] that for his special
              accommodation a certain district has been changed; and some other gentleman has been
              suited by amendments made in the House so that districts have been changed to get
              their votes. These changes have been made at the expense of others; and the moment the
              bill is brought back here again our mouths are closed and we are not to say one word
              about the changes. We are not allowed to offer amendments although certain tilings
              that have been done in the House of Representatives should be correted - and could be
              corrected by changing one single word or line. I vote "no."</p>
            <p>When the roll call was completed - </p>
            <p>The vote was announced as recorded on page 215.</p>
            <p>So the amendments made by the House of Representatives to the bill [S. 238] for the
              re-organization of the Judiciary abolishing the Court of Common Pleas, etc., were
              concurred in.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN moved to reconsider the vote by which the amendments were concurred in and
              to lay that motion on the table.</p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: That the
              proceeding in quo warranto were not to forfeit the charter of the company by reason of
              the alleged indebtedness, but for a thousand and one other reasons. The suit was
              brought, in his judgment, to hold as a rod of terror over the company to extort from
              it the money alledged to be due. The company is solvent, able to pay any reasonable
              judgment that can be obtained against it. A judgment of forfeiture does not, as of
              course, settle this question of indebtedness. The same question of the construction of
              Section twenty-three of the charter must come up to be adjudicated upon after the
              judgment of forfeiture, the same as before. The company contends that it is not liable
              until the Legislature has regulated its tolls. The other side contends that the
              regulation of the tolls is not a condition precedent at all, and that is the question.
              The honorable and satisfactory way to proceed, in his opinion, was to bring a direct
              suit for the money and not wait until the franchises of the corporation have been
              destroyed.</p>
            <p>Mr. COLLETT, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: It seemed to
              him that the suit new pending was in the nature of a blackmailing operation, and would
              not directly benefit the State, even if successful. On the other hand direct suit,
              according to the resolution, will advance the interests of the State by determining
              the amount of monies due. There probably is some due, and the road is able to pay it.
              Then if the charter is forfeited the <pb n="548" xml:id="VAA8558-14-548"/> road will
              have to go into some other hands. I vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. DAGGY, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I suppose
              there is no Senator on the floor whose people are more directly interested in this
              question than mine. The road referred to runs through the entire county; the matter
              has been long discussed amongst my people, and I feel sure in saying that there is not
              one person in my county or in the adjoining county who is In favor of having the
              franchises of the road forfeited. The suit now pending was brought for that purpose.
              Believing as I do in relation to that I am opposed to the prosecution of that suit;
              and while I say the people are opposed to this suit, and not in favor of forfeiting
              the franchises of the road, they are in favor of directing a suit for the purpose of
              making it disgorge the school fund if any it has. Therefore I am in favor of this
              resolution. But suppose the suit goes on which is now pending and suppose it comes to
              the point where a compromise is made then it is in the hands of attorneys to make such
              disposition of it as they may agree upon.</p>
            <p>But suppose, if the prosecutors are sincere, they go on and declare the franchises of
              the road forfeited, the next suit that must be brought is the suit to determine what
              amount of school fund they have if any. Suppose the whole thing will go into the hands
              of a receiver, the next thing will be to determine what is due the State from that
              road if anything is due. On one side it is claimed that there is a large amount, and
              on the other that there is nothing. A law suit to determine that question is
              inevitable under all the circumstances. And it is no more than right in behalf of the
              people of Indiana that there should be a direct suit against the railroad and whatever
              there is in the hands of that road the people of the State should know it. By that
              direct suit the people should know the amount of that fund so that it shall go to the
              school fund. I am not in favor of laying this resolution on the table, but I am in
              favor of the passage of this resolution; therefore I vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. DITTEMORE, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: This
              summary manner of cutting off discussion is unjust. An explanation of a vote does not
              give Senators an opportunity of saying what they would like to. I am in favor of the
              passage of the pending resolution for the reason that the suit already commenced in
              the Owen Circuit Court is simply for the purpose of dissolving the franchises of the
              company, and I am opposed to that for this reason if for no other: This Railroad is
              the only railroad controlled by Indiana men, and it is the most successful road in the
              State. If this suit should be successful and the franchises of the cooporation
              dissolved, at once the company will be drawn into the hands of a receiver and pass
              into the hands of some foreign corporation. The Pan Handle road is anxiously looking
              forward to the time when it can grasp it. That is one reason why I am opposed to
              ditsolving its franchises.</p>
            <p>If the suit should be pressed to a successful termination then we are at the very
              same point this resolution directs us to: we have to commence an additional suit for
              the purpose of recovering the money due the school fund if there is any due. That suit
              may linger for years and the school fund may be cheated out of the money if any is
              due. And in my opinion there is, and it is our duty as members of the Legislature to
              take such steps as will warrant the State in collecting that fund from that
              corporation and placing it at once at the disposal of the State of Indiana. I was a
              member of the special railroad committee and regretted very much to have to make the
              report we did, but it was made at the request of the attorneys prosecuting this suit
              for the State in my county and the Attorney General; a thing in my opinion unwise and
              unfair. By the interference of attorneys some of them, in my opinion, not prosecuting
              in good faith, we were compelled to make the report we did. I vote ''no."</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said it had been
              a disputed question for the last eight or ten years, whether this company owed any
              thing to the State. It is known to every Senator that the President of the company
              presented a memoial to this Legislature, setting out the doings of the company; giving
              the amount of money they had made, the dividends they had declared, and he made a
              calculation by which according to his theory, the company owed the State nothing. He
              had taken that memorial, and the report of the company, and had spent a good deal of
              time over it with very able assistants, and had made a calculation, according to which
              this company owes the State, one million thirty-six thousand nine hundred and
              fourty-six dollars and seventy-two cents. But suppose we let the matter drift along as
              we are now doing until these proceedings in quo warranto are terminated. That will
              probably require ten years, and by that time the statute of limitations will have cut
              off the right of the State to bring suit at all. The company have asked the
              Legislature to bring suit against them. He believed their object was to notify the
              State that money was due, and that the statute would run against the State from that
              time. The question of the liability of the road must be de- <pb n="549"
                xml:id="VAA8558-14-549"/> vote, when his name was called said : My information is
              that the people along the line of this road do not desire that its franchises shall be
              forfeited. I don't think the State will have the franchises of that road forfeited. As
              soon as they become forfeited then nothing can accrue to the school fund. I don't see
              that we have anything to loose by having a direct suit to recover that money. But the
              resolution needs amending and I propose if it is not laid on the table to offer the
              following amendment in order that the State may not suffer:</p>
            <p>
              <hi rend="blockquote">Provided that nothing herein contained shall in any manner
                eflect, impair or prejudice any right, claim or demand which now exists in behalf of
                the State of Indiana, against said road.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The people have heard that this railroad is indebted to the State more than a million
              of dollars, and they are anxious to know whether it is really true or not. If it is
              true that million of dollars would come in good time just as soon as we can get it. If
              it is not true the courts ought to say so, so the public mind may be put at rest. I am
              one of the committee who recently made a report recommending no action. We did it out
              of respect to the wishes of the Attorney General General and the prosecuting attorneys
              in the pending suit. But the question comes home now: shall we delay this matter and
              test the question whether the franchises of the road shall be forfeited or shall we
              order a direct suit to be brought for this money at the same time providing that
              nothing shall impair or affect the rights of the State of Indiana against the road ? I
              vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. GLESSNER, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said. I am here as
              a Senator representing in my humble way the people of the State of Indiana, and am not
              here for the purpose of representing a corporation or a class of men; and when I speak
              against the resolution in explanation of my vote I do it conscientiously, believing
              that I am right. As I stated a few moments ago, this matter was referred to a
              committee and that committee made a report, and after discussing that report half a
              day it was adopted by yeas and nays; and the question as I understood it, was settled
              that no further steps was to be taken on the part of the General Assembly, and this
              matter was to rest and be determined by the Court. This quo warranto case, brought
              some twelve months ago has virtually been determined in behalf of the State. The
              Attorney General, the ex-attorney General and the Attorneys for the State in this case
              requested the committee to report that no further action be taken. The Attorneys who
              brought this suit understand his question. This resolution is against the protest of
              the law officer of the State, and if he were present in the Senate now I would call
              upon him to answer, and say it the face of the Senate whether this resolution is not
              without his knowledge whatever: and whether he has not understood this question has
              long since settled ;and that this suit was to be prosecuted. And he is asking now that
              this resolution be voted down as I understand him.</p>
            <p>What! dismiss this suit when more than twelve months has been occupied with it - so
              much time expended in its prosecution - and when we are ready to take a judgment
              against this company then dismiss it! Why dismiss it? I can tell you why. It is
              necessary on the part of the road, when this quo warranto was instituted this company
              was doing business under the original charter granted by the State but it has abandon
              its original charter and is now organized under a statute of the State. Now what
              effect would it have to dismiss the quo warranto suit ? It was brought against them
              before the dissolution under the special charter. Now if this suit is brought what
              condition does the State find itself in ? They set up that there is no such
              corporation - that it was dissolved long ago,and thereby defeat the action of the
              State to be instituted. There is the point. If this resolution is passed it is passed
              in the interest of the Terre Haute Railroad Company. I don't pretend to say it has
              been instigated by the men who control that company. I am acquainted with several of
              them and I say that they are gentlemen in every sense of the word ; but they are
              controlling a corporation and it is their duty to do their best for their company. I
              don't blame them for doing what is legitimate to save this money for themselves if
              they can do it in a fair way; but I say this resolution is in the interest of the
              Railroad company and against that of the State. Whenever you dismiss this quo warranto
              case you have got no case that will stick to recover the money that belongs to the
              State. Why is it that they are asking the quo warranto case to be dismissed ? It is a
              virtual admission that the action will be sustained, and if sustained as it must be,
              then there is no trouble on the part of the State in getting justice, and the children
              of the State will get what property belongs to them - there is no trouble in reaching
              the money if we stick to what we have got.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS (interposing.) How will you get it?</p>
            <p>Mr. GLESSNER. If the charges are sustained set up in the quo warranto, it works a
              forfeit of the charter of the road and a receiver will have to be appointed to take
              charge of the road if it fails to pay the money found to be due. <pb n="550"
                xml:id="VAA8558-14-550"/>Mr. DWIGGINS (interposing.) How will you find it ?</p>
            <p>Mr. GLESSNER. By the institution of another action, as well after as before. We have
              a suit already instituted which has been hanging on a year, and we have got the thing
              settled and now by dismissing it and relying upon a civil action alone - when you rely
              upon a civil action alone you bring suit against a corporation that don't exist and
              you will not recover a dollar.</p>
            <p>Mr. GOODING (interposing.) I would ask the Senator whether, as a lawyer, he thinks
              that changing the form of a corporation will relieve it from any lability
              whatever?</p>
            <p>Mr. GLESSNER. Who will you sue? </p>
            <p>A SENATOR. The Terre Haute and Indianapolis Railroad Company.</p>
            <p>Mr. GLESSNER. There is no such thing existing, and had not this quo warranto been
              brought before they dissolved this organization it would not have laid.</p>
            <p>A VOICE. Where is the law that would provide against instituting proceedings to
              ascertain the amount due?</p>
            <p>Mr. GLESSNER. There will be no trouble about the amount whenever judgment is taken
              upon this quo warranto.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN. I would ask whether the road is liable at all or not?</p>
            <p>Mr. GLESSNER. That very question has been decided by a demurrer and a very
              respectable Circuit Court has held that it is liable. I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. GREGG, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: I have but a
              single word to justify my vote. This is a very important subject, involving a vast sum
              of money to the school fund, and I think no lawyer ever determines a case until he
              knows the facts. This question involves many legal questions. We have an opinion from
              the Attorney General in regard to the suit he is prosecuting in behalf of the state of
              Indiana - a paper to back up the vote I expect to give. I presume that gentleman is
              competent to give a good opinion but whether that be so or not I shall vote to sustain
              his position and not vote to dismiss the suit. I shall vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. HALL, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, was understood to say
              that he regarded this as Railroad paper, and in a suit between himself and another
              individual if the opposing party should come to him asking him to make payment before
              the suit was decided he should think he had some sort of advantage which he ought to
              hold on to. He took the same view of this case, and where so many legal minds differ
              should vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. HARNEY, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: As my views
              are a little peculiar I prefer explaining my position. I am not in favor of the
              Attorney General commencing suit for the reason that I do not believe the railroad
              owes the State a cent. I take it from the proposition that the State never done
              anything more for it than for any other road. I know that is a very unpopular
              position, but I take it from the fact that when the charter was granted the State
              reserved certain rights to itself and a year or two after the whole system of granting
              charters was abolished and all railroads put on the same level. The question is; Where
              is the quid pro quo?</p>
            <p> Mr. THOMPSON, (interposing.) Is that provision in any other charter?</p>
            <p>Mr. HARNEY. I think the Michigan Southern. In that case there was a guarantee that no
              road should run within twenty miles on either side. In this case there was a provision
              in the eighteenth section that the State should protect it against unreasonable
              competition.</p>
            <p>Mr. THOMPSON. What was the object of making that provision?</p>
            <p>Mr. HARNEY. The Government would give a special charter and come in as a partner in
              the profits. The State giving the charter would participate in the profits on account
              of the unusual privileges granted. The State Bank had a special provision in its
              charter, by which the State forbid any other institution from issuing paper money. For
              that reason there was a provision reserving; to the State a certain per cent which
              added largely to the school fund. The State being directly interested in its profits
              it is to be presumed the State took special care not to allow competition. It was a
              common argument that the State would protect a charter better because the State was a
              party interested. Immediately after the State rejected all that and all railroads have
              been organized under the general law and to-day there is another road running in
              competition with that road, connecting the same points. The State would never have
              granted that charter after participating in the profits all the time - at least it is
              not probable it would grant a charter for a road running parellel with one it was
              interested in. After the dismissal of the quo warranto I am not competent to determine
              whether the charter would be forfeited or not, and therefore could not vote for a
              dismissal of it. If I thought there was any debt I would sue for the debt. They may
              have forfeited their charter over and over again, I know not. I believe I have reason
              to expect that the court will do justice to the parties and will not grant that right
              unless it is well determined that the railroad has forfeited its franchises. I vote
              "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I am <pb
                n="551" xml:id="VAA8558-14-551"/> in a position where I don't feel free to speak of
              this subject. I am not advised that this resolution is introduced at the instigation
              of the Governor or any officer of State, on the other hand I understand it is in
              direct opposition to their wishes. The men whose duty it is to look after the
              interests of Indiana are not asking us to pass a resolution of this character, but are
              asking the very opposite of that. I presume the Attorney General would not come here
              and ask us not to do a thing which would result to the advancement of the interests of
              the State. Since this discussion has commenced I have consulted with him and have been
              advised by him that this thing ought not to be done. He has taken the pains to
              investigate this matter and knows whereof he speaks, and he says it is the very worst
              thing we can do. So far as I am advised it is not my duty to vote for it. I would like
              the Senator who offered this resolution to tell us whether it came from any State
              officer.</p>
            <p>Mr. SMITH. I consulted with no representative of the State nor with any one else. I
              have waited patiently for somebody to offer something of this kind and assume the
              responsibility, but as no one else has seen fit I have done it.</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH. No officer of State has been consulted by the gentleman. He has been
              careful, according to his own statement, not to consult with the Attorney General who
              has been charged with the prosecution of this case; - he has not consulted any man
              whose duty it is to look after the interests of the State; but upon his own
              responsibility he asks the Senate to direct these officers to withhold their hand.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS (interposing.) I would ask the Senator as a lawyer, whether the Attorney
              General can control that quo warranto proceeding?</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH. I do not understand that he has primary control.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. Suppose the prosecuting Attorney should propose to dismiss the suit can
              the Attorney General say he should not?</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH. I suppose the court would not allow it.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. Has the Attorney General any right from the fact of his being Attorney
              General, to appear for the State and control it ?</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH. I do not understand it in that way, but I understand he has done that in
              the discharge of his duty as Attorney General. I don't presume any judge would permit
              the case to be dismissed by the prosecuting Attorney if the Atterney General was there
              as he is here protesting against this resolution to-day. If he would he ought to be
              impeached. I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT, in explanation his of vote, when his name was called, said: I hope the
              Senate will pardon me for explaining my vote. I am a little differently situated from
              anybody else in regard to this matter. I am a little more interested than anybody else
              in this resolution. I am a representative of Vigo county and I think I know their
              wishes and that would determine my vote. I know they are opposed to forfeiting the
              franchises of that road as I know I am opposing a proposition which looks to a
              forfeiture of the franchises of that road. I know these Senators sitting here as
              representatives of the people of this State are not discharging their duty towards the
              counties of this State between here and the State line when they are taking steps to
              bring about a forfeiture of the franchise of a great corporation worth millions and
              thousands upon thousands of dollars to the people of the State living between here and
              the State line; when the entire object can be accomplished without jeopardizing the
              franchises of that corporation. At one time I was selected as an Attorney to
              investigate the condition of that road. I prepared interrogatories and a report was
              made upon them but that report never saw daylight in the Senate. A committee in the
              other House was appointed and their report never saw daylight. We appointed a
              committee here and it is the first one that ever had a report which saw daylight upon
              that subject.</p>
            <p>Now may it please Senators, I want to give you some information. If you will take the
              twenty-third section of the charter of that corporation you will find that there is a
              provision of law by which that company may be investigated, and how? Not by a
              resolution of the Senate ; not by a resolution of the House of Representatives, but by
              a resolution of the General Assembly. And what is that? It is not a concurrent or a
              joint resolution, and I say to-day that the General Assembly of Indiana has never
              appointed a committee to investigate the condition of that Terre Haute and
              Indianapolis Railroad. I say, standing in my place, with the solemnities of a Senator
              upon me, that no demand has ever been made upon that corporation by any persons
              legally authorized to ask that corporation for a dollar of money, from its foundation
              down to to-day, for the purposes of the school fund, or in the interest of the State.
              Before the State shall take away the franchises of that road it ought in common
              decency to send some State officer to ask for money due if there is any. Must we say
              that the Prosecuting Attorney of a little country town, with a couple of country
              lawyers have the right to demand in the name of the State millions of dollars of
              school money, while here are State officers <pb n="552" xml:id="VAA8558-14-552"/>who
              should be the ones to demand it ? Two years ago we passed a law - a joint resolution -
              directing the State's Attorney to bring suit for every dollar of claim due from any
              person whatever. When the State has pointed out a way in which a thing shall be done,
              any other way is illegal and void. It has directed the prosecuting Attorney to bring
              action: he failed to do it, and yet now we propose to direct the Attorney General to
              bring suit. We passed a law two years ago directing him to bring suit, and now we are
              passing a resolution directing him in so many words to bring suit. I understand he is
              to-day upon this floor counselling us not to do that.</p>
            <p>I don't know by what authority he comes in here to express an opinion to me. I have
              my own independent opinion upon this subject and I vote accordingly. I don't care in
              whose interest this resolution is brought here; the question is: Is it right? The
              Superintendent of Public Instruction is the legally constituted guardian of the school
              monies; make the suit to be brought in his name, giving him authority to demand of
              this corporation the money due, if it owes any? The corporation says it don't but the
              State says it does. We determine that kind of a question in the courts. I would like
              to know if we are driven to the extremity of raising a million dollars upon the
              execution of a prosecuting attorney in a county away from here without any authority
              to act. Had he the right to bring the suit? What authority had he to bring it? Who
              authorized him to bring it? Did the Governor authorize him? Never in the world. Did
              the Superintendent of Public Instruction authorize him? Never. Did the Secretary of
              State? Never. Who did authorize him?</p>
            <p>Mr. HUBBARD (interposing.) I suppose that the laws of the State of Indiana authorize
              any prosecuting Attorney to commence suit in behalf of the State.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. I understand that to be so if he has the proper reason. In the complaint
              he alleged that the demand was made and refused. I know that is false, and I speak
              whereof I know; he can never recover unless he shows the money was demanded by the
              proper person. You may prosecute the quo warranto to all eternity and you have then to
              bring another suit to know whether the road owes any money. Suppose it owes no money
              then you have destoyed the corporation because you thought it owed the State. I will
              say to the Senate that there are no corporations running in Indiana but what have in
              some particular violated the law. A Senator says it has been decided upon a demurrer
              that this claim is just. Because the complaint alledges that there was money due,
              demanded - and refused. Of course the court wouldn't decide any other way. There are
              other things in the complaint - that it took money from the State when carrying troops
              during the war. Did anybody ask the corporation for that money back?</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS (interposing.) The company never took one dollar. The State acted as
              agent collected the money from the United States and paid it over to the company.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. This is not a new matter. This is not the only corporation that has got
              this thing in its charter. There is another railroad that had a charter before 1852
              which has the same provision in its charter that this railroad has. It is not a new
              thing. Must there be an action of quo warranto in every case? What did the Senator
              from St. Joseph [Mr. Hubbard] do? He has a railroad running through his district in
              whose charter there is the same provision. Did he bring an action of quo warranto? By
              no means. He introduced a joint resolution calling upon that Railroad for an account
              just as we ought to do in this case to-day if acting as sensible men. If they fail to
              make that amount a quo warranto is the remedy. If they make an account and deny they
              owe anything, a suit at law is the proper remedy. Suppose the prosecuting Attorney of
              Putman county was ready to restore that money how much will we pay him for his
              services? Are you willing to leave the interests of Indiana for a million of dollars
              in the hands of an irresponsible man. I say I am not willing to do it.</p>
            <p>Mr. SLALER (interposing.) I will ask if the Attorney General is a responsible
              party?</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. The Attorney General has no more authority over that suit than I in law.
              An Attorney in court having his name to a complaint has the right to control it and
              its the duty of the court to say he has the right to control it if he brought it
              properly. The Senator seems to think there is some danger because this corporation was
              organized under the law of 1852.</p>
            <p>Mr. SLATER The reason I think there is some danger is because the officers of the
              railroad urge this, and the Attorney General the agent of the school fnnd urge that we
              don't do it.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. I would like to know whether the Attorney General is a member of this
              Senate.</p>
            <p>Mr. SLATER. He has sent a written opinion here.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. And we have the written opinion of as good as he saying this corporation
              don't owe a dollar to the school fund The point made by a Senator over the way is that
              this corporation was reorganized un- <pb n="553" xml:id="VAA8558-14-553"/> der the law
              of 1852, and is therefore discharged. I would like to know if a man can be discharged
              from a debt by changing his name or residence? I never heard of such a thing, and it
              is very singular if that corporation is discharged from the payment of the debt, that
              it would come in and ask this Senate to pass a resolution to bring suit in their other
              name.</p>
            <p>Mr. GLESSNER. Taking it for granted that the Terre Haute Company under the old
              corporation is disolved and there is no old corporation, who would the State sue?</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT, Do just exactly as an individual does. When a man dies his property don't
              die - his property is living.</p>
            <p>Mr. GLESSNER. Who do you sue?</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. Either sue the individual or the property. You would sue the present
              corporation. Why here is the present corporation asking for this suit to be brought,
              wouldn't it be very singular if it should turn round and say "I aint liable?". A quo
              warranto has nothing to do with the amount owing to the State. Your quo warranto don't
              do any good because you have to recover the money due the State by a suit at law and
              the action will date from the filing of the complaint on that subject because that is
              a civil proceeding. I vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. SLATER, in explanation of his vote, when his name wsa called, said: There is only
              one question that controls my vote. Agents of this named corporation are here
              demanding that this resolution be put through while the Attorney General, in the
              interest of the school fund is demanding that we let this suit go on that is now being
              prosecuted. I therefore vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. SMITH, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I will say to
              the Senator from Vanderburgh [Mr. Gooding] that I am willing to accept his amendment.
              I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I don't think
              that we are setting as a court to determine whether this suit should be dismissed or
              not. I don't think that is our business. This suit has been brought and whether by the
              proper or improper person is not for us to determine, but by the terms of this
              resolution we are asked not only to require suit to be brought directly against this
              company, but we are asked to dismiss another action which has been brought by somebody
              else: it is said by a person wholly irresponsible; that is, a persen unauthorized to
              bring that suit for the State. If that is true we have no more right to order that
              suit dismissed than any other suit.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT, (interposing.) Let me explain. This State is liable for the costs of that
              suit whether she recovers or not. I know what I am talking about.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE, Thus far that suit has been in favor of the State - in favor of this
              claim, and for the State. Then if the gentleman's [Mr. Scott] allegation is true, the
              State binds herself for the costs. I have full confidence in the officers we have
              appointed. I know of nothing they have done to forfeit the esteem of the Legislature
              and the country, and until something of that kind occurs I am willing to regard them
              as gentlemen, therefore I would not be willing to interfere with this matter. As far
              as this quo warranto is concerned it is true, it does not determine the amount due the
              State but if they forfeit their franchises that places them in much the same situation
              a bankrupt would be placed in, and when you place them in bankruptcy there will be a
              commissioner appointed and whatever the railroad has will be placed in the hands of a
              receiver to hold until the other question can be determined. Is there anything wrong
              in that? If this corporation owes the State anything it is wrong for a receiver to be
              appointed in order to hold what it has until such time as the claim is made good.</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT (interposing.) Don't that stop the running of the road ?</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE. I don't think it does, and I care not as far as that matter is concerned.
              When a corporation has not done what it agreed to their franchises ought to be
              forfeited. I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. THOMPSON, when his name was called; in explanation of his vote, said:
              Indianapolis is very much attached to her railroads, and very much attached to this
              railroad. I believe it is about the third road that was made in the State. I remember
              very well when it was made, and the terrible sacrifice that was gone through with by
              the men now running this road. Indiana has paid a great amount of money for making her
              railroads, and now we are called upon because some person charges this road with owing
              the school fund one million of dollars, to make this company forfeit its franchises.
              We have no assurance before this Senate that this road owes us one doller. I have
              great confidence in the judgment of the Senator from Montgomery [Mr. Harney] and he
              declares he does not believe this company owes one dollar. And I have great confidence
              in the Senator - I don't remember his name - from Jasper [Mr. Dwiggins] and he
              believes it does owe the State something. It is unreasonable to ask Senators to vote
              to disable the only road in the State that ever did succeed, when we don't know
              whether the company owes us one cent or not. I never traveled over that road without
              paying for it - they never sent me a <pb n="554" xml:id="VAA8558-14-554"/> corruption
              fund - this season they gave me no ticket - and under no circumstances would I give
              that company trouble when we don't know whether the company owes us a cent, or not. I
              vote "no,"</p>
            <p>Mr. RINGO, requesting his name to be called again, said : After hearing the arguments
              of lawyers on both sides, and not wishing to lay a single obstacle in the way of this
              road I will change my vote. I vote "no."</p>
            <p>When the roll call was completed - </p>
            <p>The vote was announced as above recorded.</p>
            <p>So the joint resolution was laid on the table.</p>
            <p>And then the Senate adjourned till to-morrowing morning. </p>

          <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
          <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Lawrence, by way of explanation of his vote, when his name was called
            said: This was a bill in the interest of rich men. There are men who have acquired large
            tracts of land, and who, when they go home, feel as if they were monarchs of all they
            surveyed"lords of creation." in short. They have determined that if any of their fellow
            men have not been fortunate enough to acquire as large landed estates as they have, they
            shall not have the priviege of hunting upon their lands. They have an imaginary line
            running around their broad acres, and they say to their poor neighbor who has been
            unfortunate, when one of them dares to cross that, line, that he is a trespasser, and
            guilty of a misdemeanor. If any man dares to shoot a quail upon their sacred soil, they
            claim the right to prosecute him. They claim the right to go into the courte I and
            consume the time of the court with such little, frivolous business as that. They claim
            the right to have the people to pay a tax in order that they may prosecute men for
            little violations of finch a law as that. Every one shall pay a tribute to the large
            landholders. No man has a right in this country unless he owns a large amount of land,
            and that man's rights are paramount; they are to be regarded, and the rights of others
            are to be utterly disregarded. Now, sir, it was apparent to the friends of this bill
            that it would not bear investigation. Therefore they resorted to the gag rule in order
            to pass it throught this Senate. They resorted to another expedient. They said to a
            large number of the inhabitants of the State <pb n="556" xml:id="VAA8558-14-556"/> of
            Indiana that they should not even be heard by petition. A right that is guaranteed to
            them by the constitution is witheld from them by this Senate this morning. Here is the
            Senator from Tippecanoe county with a petition signed by one thousand repestable
            citizens of his county who ask to be heard before this General Assemby ask to have their
            remonstrance read before this Senate, and they are not permitted to have it read. This
            bill is wrong and I apprehend that there is not a single Senator upon this floor who, if
            when he came here, had avowed his purpose to support a bill of this kind, would have
            reached his seat in this Senate Chamber; and I say to those who vote for it, that not
            half a dozen of them can ever come back, and they ought not to come back here.</p>
          <p>This bill is simply a bill in the interest of the rich and for the purpose of
            oppressing the poor. Take any of our large cities. There are young men there, and young
            men must have recreation of some kind. I maintain that it is better for these young men
            to be allowed to go out and engage in some kind of inanly recreation upon the broad
            acres, even of these rich men, than to drag them into the saloons and other places of
            vice for recreation. I believe that this bill is wrong. I am sorry it could not be
            discussed here. I am sorry to tresspass upon the time of the Senate in discussing this
            measure but I warn Senators that they will hear from the people if they pass this
            measure. I vote "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. GLESSNER, in explanation of his vote when his name was called said: This bill has
            been before the Senate about ninety days, and it has been fully and fairly discussed on
            several occasions. Every Senator has had an opportunity of expressing his opinion as to
            the merits of the bill time and again, and yet gentlemen came in to-day after this bill
            has been before the General Assembly all winter and claim that they shall be heard with
            a remonstrance when the bill is on its third reading. This is a bill the agricultural
            people of the State have been demanding for years; it was discussed here two years ago
            and I hope it will be now passed. I vote "aye."</p>
          <p>Mr. ORR in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: I consider that I
            have no right to enter any man's enclosure and hunt with my dog and gun without his
            consent. The dog and the firing of guns scare cattle, and when a coon is found the
            hunter don't care what kind of a tree he cuts down so he gets the coon. This is the
            first bill gotten up here for the protection of the farming community, and although it
            has been made light of I shall vote "aye."</p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR, when his name was called said: When this bill was about to be read I
            offered a petition and also a remonstrance and they were refused a hearing. I am not in
            the habit of explaining my vote but I will take this occasion to do so now, in view of
            the great discourtesy practiced by certain Senators towards my petitions. I regard it as
            the right of citizens of Indiana to be heard lere by petition or remonstrance and the
            Senate has no right to refuse to hear a petition from any citizen of the State. I take
            this occasion to remonstrate, and shall always do so whenever a citizen of the State of
            Indiana presents a petition or remons-strance here and it is treated in the same manner
            there have been by certain gentleman, I do not know whether they are friends or
            apponents of the bill. I have been in favor of this bill and am now, but I will take the
            occasion now to present the petition of sixty or seventy citizens of Indiana in favor of
            the bill and also a remonstrance signed by over one thousand in opposition to the
            passage of the bill and ask that they may go on the minutes.</p>
          <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Hubbard in the Chair.] At the present time they cannot be
            received. How does the Sen-tor vote ?</p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR. I vote "aye."</p>
          <p>Mr. THOMPSON, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: No farmer has
            ever approached me on this subject, and there never has been a request made to me to
            have such a law as this passed. The idea that a man shall take a shot gun and on going
            over another man's farm be fined for it. I hope never to see the day I cannot walk over
            unimproved grounds and use my gun. Another objection to this bill is that if it were
            enacted into a law it would create a great deal of litigation. If the farmers horses and
            cattle can stand the tooting of a railroad engine I think they can stand a little report
            from a shot gun now and then. I vote "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: Four
            hundred of my constituents have remonstrated against the passage of this bill. The
            country is full of large land holders-men in Chicago own large lots of land in my
            district, and are they to be allowed to dictate to men who live in the neighborhood
            where they shall hunt ? We have had legislation it seems to me which has be restricting
            the rights of the people. Are they incapable of taking care of themselves ? I am tired
            of this kind of legislation; and I think this thing of restricting the rights of the
            people without being instructed by them to do so, is stepping beyond the latitude of
            legislation. I am opposed to this bill on principle. I think the principle embodied in
            it is all <pb n="557" xml:id="VAA8558-14-557"/> wrong. I am opposed to laws that
            restrict the rights of the people. I vote "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. SLATER, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said : This bill
            proposes to place the execution of the criminal law in the hands of the wealthy land
            owner to the exclusion of all others : and for that principle I will not vote. I vote
            "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. STEELE, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said. Personally I am
            not caring a great deal how this goes. I have had my day hunting; but I shall vote
            against this bill simply because I think it inoperative in the way it is drawn. And I am
            opposed to it in principle. I think it operates against a certain class, where there are
            prosecutions gotten up for the purpose of harrasing rather than doing the public good. I
            vote "no."</p>
          <p>When the roll call was completed - </p>
          <p>The vote was announced as above recorded.</p>
          <p>So the hunting-on-enclosed-lands bill [H. R. 8] was finally passed.</p>
          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">DEFENDANTS TO TESTIFY IN CRIMINAL CASES.</head>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH moved to suspend the order of business to take his bill S. 34, to give
              defendants the right to testify in their own behalf in criminal cases; that it may be
              read the third time and put it on its passage.</p>
            <p>Several efforts were made to amend the motion - see pp. 231 and 232 - but they were
              all voted down, and Mr. Hough's motion prevailed, so the bill was read the third
              time.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN opposed the passage of the bill, believing that it would be an act of mercy
              to the defendant to defeat it. If he refuses to testify the jury will say that by his
              silence he confesses his guilt. If he testifies, they will say that if he was mean
              enough to commit the felony, he will be mean enough to commit perjury to clear
              himself. He believed that in cases of misdemeanor it would work injustice to the
              State, and in cases of felony it would work injustice to the defendant.</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH. I think the intelligent spirit of the age will sustain a law of this kind.
              It is in operation in Ohio and I have heard no complaint of it. I believe it is in
              operation in the State of New York. I do not believe it will have a tendency to
              convict any innocent man. There are many times when members of the Senate as well as
              other persons might be surrounded by circumstances pointing to guilt, when if he could
              explain the circumstances as perhaps no other person could, his innocence would foe
              made plain. It is in just such cases as that this law should be enacted to meet. We
              ought not to enact a law for the purposes of enabling parties to escape justice. If
              this law would have a tendency to convict men who are guilty we ought to enact it; and
              if it will have a tendency to enable parties innocent to establish that innocence, we
              ought to enact it. If they are able to come into court and explain to the jury trying
              the case and by their evidence rebut these suspicious circumstances they ought to have
              the privilege of doing it. I cannot see any evils that will result from such a law. I
              do hope the Senate will come up and support this bill. The House of Representatives
              has already passed a bill containing the same provisions in substance as are in this
              bill. Every principle of justice demands the passage of this bill. By a bill recently
              passed, the State is given the opening and close in criminal cases, and surely the
              defendant ought to have this additional privilege in his defense.</p>

            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS opposed concurrence in the amendment proposing a new section legalizing
              all acts of draining companies whose work is sixteen miles in length, or under. He
              believed it would fasten upon the people of the Kankakee Valley all the evils from
              which they are struggling to free themselves; that it would make the Kankakee Draining
              Company a thousand fold more oppressive; that it would legalize all its illegal acts
              and the assessments the people are now fighting against, amounting to some four
              million eight hundred thousand dollars. Why legalize illegal corporations? Why strike
              down the defense of this people in the Kankakee valley ?</p>
            <p>Mr. CHAPMAN. This amendment was put on in the House of Representatives, I understand
              by parties opposed to this Kankakee drainage law. It seems to me the intention of this
              amendment offered at this late day is to defeat this bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS (interposing.) I have no such intention. I will do the best I can to get
              the House of Representatives to recede from ite amendment.</p>
            <p>Mr. CHAPMAN. There is one amendment made by the House I should oppose myself, if it
              were not so late in the session, and that is the amendment requiring a majority of
              those interested in the drainage to favor the ditching, instead of one-third. I think
              to require a majority will make it impracticable, but conclude it better to adopt the
              amendments of the House of Representatives than to take the chances of sending the
              bill back there. I have no interest particularly in that second section, but I don't
              think it bears the construction the Senator from Jasper [Mr. Dwiggins] attempts to put
              on it. I think that amendment meets the case of some Senators who made objection to
              the bill as originally drafted. I think the bill was sufficiently guarded as it
              originally pasaed by the Senate but I think it is the defect of the bill if these
              House amendments are not now concurred in by the Senate. We might as well say we will
              have ne drainage law upon the statute books. Therefore I hope the Senate will concur
              in the amendments as they were passed by the House of Representatives.</p>
            <p>Mr. BOONE. For the purpose of enabling citizens of the counties I represent to
              organize drainage companies I am willing to concur in these amendments. I am quite
              sure the construction given by the gentleman from the north [Mr. Dwiggins] is not
              correct - it is not intended, nor can it by any possibility, apply to that Kankakee
              Company. I cannot see that it will injure or effect the Kankakee Drainage Company at
              all. I think there is nothing wrong in the amendment, and I do not think there is the
              danger in the language that the gentleman attributes to it; in fact if I understand
              the language at all, I know it cannot be so and is not intended to be so. These
              amendments ought to be adopted for the purpose of allowing companies that have failed
              to complete their work to form them articles of association and carry out what they
              intended to.</p>

                up, the rules were suspended and the bill was passed by yeas 45, nays 0.</p>
              <p>Mr. HARNEY explained that this bill was intended particularly for the relief of
                several gentleman in his [Montgomery] county who have tied up all their means in

              <p>Mr. BROWN from the select Committee appointed just before the recess for dinner, to
                which was referred Mr. Collett's bill [S. 273] to provide that the collection of
                county or township railroad aid tax, shall not be prevented by any defect or
                omission in the proceedings under which the vote was taken returned the same with an
                amendment as directed by the Senate so that the bill shall apply only to railroads
                completed.</p>
              <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
              <p>Mr. CARNAHAM the more he explains this bill the more he is opposed to it, being
                satisfied there is something wrong in it There is too much legalizing the
                informalities of railroad companies. He believed the bill to be wrong. There is no
                notice required by any provision in it.</p>
              <p>Mr. RHODES thought the amendment leaves the bill in a no less objectionable shape.
                This proposed law goes a step beyond anything we have ever had. It proposes to
                legalize every thing looking to a donation to railroads. I don't admit the
                proposition that a majority have the right to impose a railroad tax - cut loose from
                the formalities of law and then come before this legislature and ask that their
                irregular conduct shall be recognized and made binding and valid. That is precisely
                what is proposed in this bill. There are pending numerous cases in litigation
                growing out of this veey system. The proceedings are claimed to be illegal in many
                counties and townships. The minority who have been voted down claim that they have
                the right to be heard and that the majority shall conform their action to law. This
                bill strikes down that right. It is doing very little that we should require the
                majority to conform strictly to law. It is bad and vicious legislation for us to say
                that we will strike down the wishes of these men. I shall vote against the bill. I
                think it ought to be defeated for it is based upon a wrong and vicious
                principle.</p>
              <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. While I might be opposed to anything of this kind at the time the law
                was passed, yet I am not one who is willing to come in here and say that after an
                appropriation has been voted and men have engaged in the work in good faith on their
                part and have gone as far as they can we shall step in and defeat the contract made
                between them and the citizens of any county; townships or city. I am willing to
                change this law so it shall not effect contracts hereafter made. There are cases I
                understand where under this bill, you could not collect the money voted, though they
                have completed the work along the whole line of the road, from the fact that you say
                the whole amount of the money voted shall be expended in the township where it is
                voted.</p>
              <p>Mr. BROWN held that the bill was carefully guarded, that its provisions could not
                apply except in cases where a railroad had been actually completed relying on
                appropriation voted, and where the election had been fairly conducted and without
                fraud. He said where a railroad had been built under these circumstances, and the
                people were in the enjoyment of its advantages, they ought not to be permitted to
                escape the payment of the tax on a mere technicality.</p>
              <p>Mr. HUBBARD. I am opposed to this bill, and I think I know what its provisions are.
                It is the most sweeping thing of its character I have ever seen. He believed this
                bill was introduced for the purpose of <pb n="560" xml:id="VAA8558-14-560"/>
                assisting a little road in Vigo county which passes through the corner of several
                townships and has not the length of track in each on which to expend the money voted
                etc. He contended that it was a most dangerous measure - one which would enable
                railroad companies to collect taxes voted at an election whereof no notice had been
                given, and at which but a small portion of the tax-payers may have voted.</p>
              <p>Mr. SLEETH. To the second section I have serious objection. I submit to the Senate
                that is not right or just. As far as the third section the better way to reach the
                same end would be to repeal entirely the act passed at the present session amending
                the act of 1869. I submit to the Senate it is much easier for the railroad company
                to procure money under this bill and much more severe upon the county, or township
                than the act of 1869, It seems to me as the Senator from Warren [Mr. Rhodes] said
                there is entirely too much legalizing here.</p>
              <p>Mr. STEELE. I think this bill ought not to pass if we were in earnest in passing
                the act of January last, for I think it virtu-tually repealing that law. And for the
                purpose of bringing this idea more directly before the Senate I read the provisions
                of the act referred to and compared them with the bill under consideration. This
                thing of voting a tax by the majority is considered questionable ; and they should
                be held to a strict construction of the law. I think we have a good law now in the
                one of January 1873.</p>
              <p>Mr. DWIGGINS said the bill was drawn so as to apply to roads that are less than
                twenty-four miles long. He said they had been unable to find but one road in the
                State which did not exceed twenty-four miles in length, and that was the road whose
                case this bill was intended to meet. He believed that it could not apply to any
                other road, and that the danger which Senators apprehended from it was entirely
                imaginary.</p>
              <p>Mr. SCOTT. When this proposition was up before, the Senate will remember I opposed
                it. I did so upon a very simple ground and I think a just one. I was opposed to it
                because that proposition did not relieve two railroads instead of one. When the
                original bill was introduced I opposed it with all my might. I thought I had good
                reason for opposing it. I think so still, and because the bill was wrong there could
                be no provision in this bill too stringent for me provided it didn't go beyond the
                original law. The ground that I took with regard to the original law I think applies
                to this somewhat. I say the collection of the taxes which the law authorizes to be
                put upon the duplicate is a matter of contract between the railroad companies and
                the city, township or county -it is part of the contract, and the essence of the
                contract, and it was a portion of that contract which I say this Senate has no right
                to interfere with and why? I will read the reasons that governed me when I cast my
                vote against the other law, if I can find them. [Mr. S. reads from the Constitution
                of Indiana.] "No ex-part facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contract
                shall ever be passed." I would like to know if the time the money was to be
                collected was not the essence of the contract between the companies and the cities,
                towns and counties. I say it was, and the law extending that time in violation of
                the wishes of the people was a violation of the Constitution upon that point. Now
                after the law has been found to operate harshly, I say I am not very particular as
                to the amount for myself, because I believe the whole thing to be void.</p>
              <p>Mr. SLATER demanded the previous question, and there being a second, the bill was
                passed the Senate by yeas 28, nays 19.</p>
              <p>Mr. ROSEBRUGH explaining as follows; I voted against the bill last evening but
                having listened to this discussion I am inclined now to support it. I am not
                ordinarily in favor of the system of taxation of which this is a type; but now that
                taxation has been entered into as a system in this State and sustained by the
                courts; and while it is true that railroads are bound to follow a strict
                construction of the law, where there is no fraud and where everything has been done
                fairly. I think it equitable for the Legislature to relieve them from any technical
                difficulty where they have gone on to perfect the work and complete it. I voted
                against the bill yesterday because it didn't provide for the completion of the work,
                but understanding from the argument - I have not had time to read the bill - that it
                simply compels parties to enjoin before the completion of the work and prevents them
                enjoining after the completion which I consider just and proper. I support the bill.
                I vote "aye."</p>

              <p>On motion of Mr. CHAPMAN the Senate resumed the consideration of the amendments of
                the House of Representatives to his bill [S. 88,] the drainage bill.</p>
              <p>Mr. DWIGGINS said that since the adjournment at noon, he had consulted several able
                lawyers respecting the section proposed by the House, and to which he had objected,
                and they gave it as their opinion that under that section the Kankakee Draining
                Company could organize a new company for each <pb n="561" xml:id="VAA8558-14-561"/>
                sixteen miles of their line and that then all the assessments, amounting to four
                million eight hundred thousand dollars would be legalized. He hoped the amendment
                would not be concurred in, and that the people of that valley would not be mulcted
                in this enormous and ruinous sum.</p>
              <p>Mr. STEELE. I am sorry to see my vigorous young friend from the Kankakee valley
                [Mr. Dwiggins] on his old theme again. I have the word of gentlemen that they will
                not vote for the bill without these amendments. We passed a law the gentleman
                desired at the commencement of this lession with the understanding that this Chapman
                bill would be put through ; and I am proud to say there are Senators on this floor
                standing by their agreement. The objection raised by the gentleman from Kankakee is
                this: that if this bill passes the Kankakee Valley Company may organize under the
                sexteenth mile clause. The argument goes to this: we are to have no drainage law. If
                they can organize under the sixteen mile clause, may they not do it under the act
                requiring a single mile? The same obejction urged against the sixteen miles may be
                urged against any</p>
              <p>Mr. BEARDSLEY moved the previous question, which was seconded by the Senate.The
                first amendment striking out "one-half," and inserting "a majority," in lieu was
                concurred in.</p>
              <p>The second amendment - see page 232 - was not concurred in - yeas 16, nays 29.</p>
              <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
              <p>Mr. BOONE, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: I would
                rather concur in this amendment than have no law upon this subject.</p>
              <p>Mr. CHAPMAN, in explanation of his vote when his name was called said: I have no
                objection to having this section stricken out. I was in favor of having one-third,
                as the original bill contemplated to petition for the draining, but rather than miss
                having a law upon the subject I prefer taking the bill with a majority. I understand
                this provision was introduced in the House by a friend of a drainage law. I do not
                think that the construction put upon it by the Senator from Jasper [Mr. Dwiggins]
                can be correct. Rather than have no law upon the subject I prefer voting in favor of
                the House amendments, and will therefore vote "aye."</p>

              <p>The vote was announced as above recorded.</p>

              <p>Mr. CHAPMAN then moved to reconsider the vote by which the first amendment was

              <p>Mr. WADGE. I hope this motion will not prevail for it does seem to me that the
                action of the House in that respect was eminently wise. I believe it proper to leave
                this matter in the hands of a majority of the property holders.</p>
              <p>Mr. ROSEBRUGH. It seems to me the House hadn't ought to recede from that amendment.
                All this turmoil and trouble, and the beseighing of courts and legislation on laws
                which allows of this system of taxation comes from the fact that the will of the
                majority is not carried out. Whenever you depart from it you will find the majority
                opposing the law passed.</p>
              <p>Mr. BOONE. As far as I am concerned, I don't care anything about this amendment. I
                am willing to take anything in the shape of a drainage law. It is a matter of life
                and death with us. Men who live in districts well drained by nature cannot
                comprehend the situation and they ought to consider the rights of the people who
                live in districts required to be drained. When drainage is well done it reclaims the
                finest soil in the world. It is developing the resources of the State faster than
                any other law on the statute books. I think it unimportant whether these amendments
                are reconsidered or not.</p>
              <p>Mr. WADGE. The House of Representatives have sent this bill back with an amendment
                which neutralizes all we have done in the repealing act. We are willing to vote for
                the bill but the amendment is obnoxious. If that is removed I pledge myself to vote
                for it. I don't think Senators are doing us justice when they intimate that we are
                acting in bad faith. The amendment we believe unsafe for the people, and will result
                in the reorganization of the Kankakee Valley Draining Company.</p>
              <p>Mr. STEELE. I hope gentlemen will allow this bill to pass as it went from the
                Senate. Unless they had promised some new ditching law I doubt whether they would
                have got a repeal of the law of 1869.</p>
              <p>Mr. HUBBARD. In accordance witte my pledge, I am anxious that this bill shall
                become a law in the shape in which it left the Senate.</p>
              <p>The motion to reconsider was rejected by yeas 13, nays 29.</p>
              <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
              <p>Mr. DWIGGINS, in explanation of his vote,when his name was called, said: I desire
                to keep my pledge, and I have been informed since the discussion has been going on
                that the House of Representatives will probably not recene from this one amendment,
                and as I desire that this bill shall become a law I therefore vote "no."</p>
              <p>So the motion to reconsider was rejected.</p>

          <p>Mr. TAYLOR. from the committee on Finance, returned House Bill No. 504, supplimental
            and amendatory to the assessment law with amendments providing among other things, for a
            tax of three per cent. on the gross earnings of foreign Insurance Companies, the Pulman
            Palace Car Company in this State, and of fast freight lines.</p>
          <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS enterest his protest against the tax of three per cent. levied on the
            gross receipts of railroad companies, and of foreign insurance companies less losses
            actually paid in the State. He believed its effect would be to drive these companies
            from the State, or cause a serious advance in the rates of insurance. He characterized
            this as one of the most dangerous bills ever introduced.</p>
          <p>Mr. BROWN feared the provisions for the semi-anual collection of taxes would work great
            inconvenience and disadvantage to tax-payers and officers.</p>
          <p>Mr. BOONE said he opposed this bill on the ground that the important part of the Senate
            bill on this subject is left out of this onethe part that repeals certain sections of
            the act of last seseion and he was not to be caught in this sort of a trap.</p>
          <p>Mr. STEELE also thought the Senate bill superior to this one. He opposed the semiannual
            payment of taxes. He moved to recommit the bill to a select committe of five with
            instructions to insert the clause in the Senate bill repealing the old sections in the
            law in relation to tax rates and deeds; and to report the same back at 2 o'clock
            to-day.</p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. DITTEMORE this motion was laid on the table.</p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. DWIGGINS the bill was amended by consent so as to provide that the tax
            of three per cent. shall not be collected from railroad companies owning and operating
            any railroad in the State.</p>
          <p>The bill was passed by the following vote.</p>

          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS said: All the provisions of the bill are good except the one taxing
            insurance companies.</p>
          <p>Mr. GREGG, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: The bill similar
            to this one presented in the Senate has already passed the House therefore if I am
            correct in that I vote "aye."</p>
          <p>Mr. HOWARD, in explanation of hia vote when his name was called, said: This bill <pb
              n="563" xml:id="VAA8558-14-563"/> authorizes the collection of taxes twice in a year,
            on the 15th of April for half and on the 15th of November for the other half, so there
            is an extension of eleven months time after the duplicate goes into the hands of the
            Treasurer. It strikes me as far as the State Treasury is concerned, and the interests of
            the people the taxes should all be collected by the 15th of April I therefore vote
            "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. ROSEBEUGH, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said :
            Understanding that this is a bill to tax insurance companies though it does not exactly
            meet my views yet it is so late in the session for fear we may not get any other
            legislation on the subject I vote "aye"</p>
          <p>When the roll call was finished.The result was announced as above recorded.</p>
          <p>So the bill passed.</p>
          <p>Mr. O'Brien's bill [S. 229] to legalize the official acts of the trustees of the town
            of Cicero was read the third time.</p>
          <p>Mr. BROWN was informed that this bill does very great injustice to people that don't
            belong to the town.</p>
          <p>Mr. DWIGGINS said all of them agree in a desire to pay the bonds issued to pay for the
            school house and they cannot pay the bonds unless this bill is passed.</p>
          <p>Mr. STEELE and Mr. DAGGY also favored the bill.</p>
          <p>Mr. BOONE opposed the bill because it legalizes all acts done by said town
            trustees.</p>
          <p>Mr. BIRD preferred not to interfere in a matter which properly belongs to the
            Courts.</p>
          <p>Mr. DITTEMORE thought there was scarcely a legal act done by the board since its
            organization and he could not vote for such a sweeping legalizing act.</p>
          <p>The bill was rejected by yeas 20 nays 22.</p>
          <p>The Senate then adjourned till two o'clock P. M.</p>
          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
            <p>The Senate met pursuant to adjournment.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. BIRD, Senate bill No. 203 was taken up. It provides that when the
              title of a married man to real estate is transferred to another person - the wife not
              being bound therby - the inchoate right of the wife in the property shall become a
              vested estate, the same as if her husband had died, and she may hold, sell and convey
              the same in the same manner as her separate property.</p>
            <p>Mr. DAGGY opposed the bill. It would be offering inducements for men to let their
              property go to sale under order of the Court or convey their property without the wife
              joining in the deed in order that the one-third that goes to the wife shall remain
              vested. The bill is not right in principle.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE did not think any man who understands this bill should object to it. It is
              a bill to prevent wives and children from being turned out of house and home. Ought we
              not to protect our women and chidren thus far?</p>
            <p>Mr. RHODES, one additional reason why I favor the bill is that when property is
              levied on and sold under execution it is always considered by the purchaser that in
              case of the husbands death the wife would be entitled to one-third, and the result is
              that real estate sold in that way almost invaribly sells for one-third less than its
              real value and it seems to me, that being the fact, that we ought to put the law in
              such a condition that the purchaser shall not by the death of the wife prior to the
              death of the husband be entitled to this one-third which never entered into the
              purchase. I think when a party purchases at sheriff's sale it is right to go as far as
              this bill, and provide that the wife have her third set oft. I am in favor of the bill
              for I believe it to be a good one.</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH. What would be the effect in case the wife die before the husband?</p>
            <p>Mr. RHODES. As a matter of course her third would go to her heirs.</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH. Then the husband and children would inherit one-third of the property held
              to pay his debts?</p>
            <p>Mr. RHODES. No. I say the wife's interest is never sold. The purchaser buys the
              property in view of the fact that the wife holds an inchoate interest. The fact of the
              sale would be to make it a vested right. The purchaser cannot complain because he
              never bought the wife's one-third.</p>
            <p>Mr. BOONE. I cannot see any great injustice to creditors and none to the husband by
              the operations of this bill. It is intended to vest the inchoate right in the wife of
              her one-third, so that she may take posession and use it in as full manner as she
              could were the husband dead. At her death it does not go to the husband if there are
              children by the marriage; and if there be none it goes to the husband and the other
              heirs of the wife. In many instances the wife has labored as hard and done as much,
              and gone through as much suffering for the acquisition of the property as the husband,
              and she ought to be protected in her rights. She cannot sell her right, she may bar
              herself by joining in the deed but she cannot transfer it; hence I think this bill
              should be upon the statute books, so that the purchrser at the sale may know what he
              gets.</p>
            <p>The bill passed the Senate by yeas 27, nays 11.</p>
            <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
            <p>Mr. HUBBARD, when his name was <pb n="564" xml:id="VAA8558-14-564"/>called; in
              explanation of his vote, said: The provisions of this bill are equivolent to setting
              apart one-third of a man's real estate for the benefit of his wife. As the laws are it
              is equal to setting apart one-sixth. This Legislature has shown a disinclination to do
              anything for the purpose of enforcing the collection of debts and I am unwilling for
              that reason to do anything farther that will have a tendency to exempt the property of
              a debtor from sale on execution, I vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said : I cannot see
              that it is more than excepting one-third of a man's realty from the claims of
              creditors, and as I believe a larger exemption should obtain I believe I will vote
              "aye."</p>

            <p>The vote was announced as above recorded.</p>

              <head rend="center">THE REVENUE BILL.</head>
              <p>Mr. TAYLOR from the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName>, returned House bill
                No. 530, to raise revenue for State purposes for 1873 and 1864, with a
                recommendation that it pass.</p>
              <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
              <p>On motion of Mr. DITTEMORE, the Senate then resolved itself into a
                  <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName>, for the consideration of the bill, the
                mover in the chair, and the bill was read.</p>
              <p>Mr. CHAPMAN moved to amend the bill by striking out "fifteen" and inserting "ten"
                percent.Mr. CHAPMAN explained the reasons which led him to make the motion. He said
                the estimated expenses for the year ending November 1, 1873, including all charges
                made on the Auditor's books, are one million ninety-one thousand two hundred and
                ninety dollars, seventy-two cents. In addition to that, we have already paid three
                hundred and two thousand one hundred and eighty-five dollars, thirty-eight cents of
                bonds, and also twenty-five thousand dollars interest, thirty thousand dollars to
                Purdue University, eighty-nine thousand dollars refunded taxes, have appropriated
                one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to the Insane Asylum, making the total amount
                of expenses for the year 1843, one million seven hundred and eleven thousand four
                hundred and seventy-six dollars, ten cents.</p>
              <p>There is no dispute about these figures. We had on hand on the first of November,
                1872, of available funds in the treasury, one million two hundred and seventy-five
                thousund dollars. Deducting that from the expenses and we have a deficit of about
                five hundred thousand dollars. The estimated expenses for the year ending November
                1, 1874, are eight hundred thousand dollars. Adding to that for the Insane Asylum
                the appropriation of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars, the total expenses
                for the two years will be two million eight hundred and sixty-one thousand four
                hundred and seventy-six dollars. Deducting one million two hundred and seventy-five
                thousand dollars, the amount on hand November 1,1872, and we have left to be
                provided for one million five hundred and eighty-six thousand four hundred and
                seventy-six dollars. He estimated that under the new revenue law we should have of
                property one billion one-hundred million dollars upon which to make an assessment.
                The present estimate is six hundred and fifty million dollars. It is claimed that
                the railroads will increase it one hundred million dollars, and the insurance
                companies one million dollars more, and the increased appraisement on other property
                will give a total of one billion one hundred million dollars.</p>
              <p>A tax of ten per cent, upon that will give for the year 1873, one million one
                hundred thousand dollars, and for 1874 the same sum. The delinquent taxes will be
                coming in, estimated at four hundred thousand dollars, the insurance property will
                yield two hundred thousand dollars, the railroads one hundred thousand dollars, and
                the poll tax one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, making the receipts from the
                levy three million fifty thousand dollars. Deduct twenty percent.six hundred and ten
                thosand dollars for delinquent taxes, from the whole amount, and we have left a net
                revenue of two million four hundred and forty thousand dollars with which to pay one
                million five hundred and eighty-six thousand four hundred and seventy-six dollars,
                leaving a balance of eight hundred and fifty-three thousand fine hundred and
                forty-four dollars. He believed that if the levy was fixed at fifteen cents the
                assessors would not revalue the property. But if the levy was fixed at ten cents and
                the Legislature says to the people, we have fixed the rate at the lowest possible
                limit, relying on a fair revaluation, the assessors will appraise the property at
                its fair cash value.</p>
              <p>Mr. TAYLOR said the Senator's estimate of expenses was correct, but he differed
                widely with the committees of the two Houses on his other figures. They estimate the
                receipts from insurance companies at seventy-five thousand dollars and the poll tax
                at about fifty thousand dollars. But the main point of difference between the
                Senator and the committees is, that he estimates the property subject to taxation
                under the new assessment at one billion one hundred million dollars, while the
                committees put it at eight or nine hundred million dollars. <pb n="565"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-14-565"/> Mr. BROWN thought it would be an act of folly to attempt
                to cut down the revenue from fifteen to ten per cent. He hoped the bill would be
                adopted as it comes from the House of Representatives, because he was certain it
                there received as careful consideration as possible.</p>
              <p>Mr. DWIGGINS. If we say the rate per cent. will be high the effect will be to cut
                the appraisement down; and if we put a low rate they will probably get the
                appraisement somewhere approximating the value of property, and that is an object he
                very much desired. It is desirable to have the property in the State appraised at
                its true cash value and it ought to be in order to make taxation equal and just. If
                we make the rate ten per cent. we will realize nearly as much as if we put it at
                fifteen.</p>
              <p>The amendment [Mr. Chapman's] was rejected.</p>
              <p>Mr. WILLIAMS moved that the Committe rise and report the bill back to the Senate
                with a recommendation that it pass.</p>
              <p>The motion was agreed to, the Committee arose and the chairman reported
                accordingly.</p>
              <p>After some further proceedings - see page 243 - top of second column - </p>
              <p>Mr. Chapman's amendment to strike out fifteen per cent, and insert eleven per cent,

            <head rend="center">THE STATE PRISONS.</head>
            <p>Mr. WADGE introduced a joint resolution [S. 20] directing the Wardens of the State
              Prisons to set apart the fund known as the Visitor's Fund for the purpose of
              replenishing the libraries of the prisons, not to publish the names of the convicts
              hearafter, to discontinue the use of the whip or cat as a method of punishment,
              substituting therefor such other punishment as will conduce to the good discipline of
              the prisoner; to see that the prisoners are provided with a suit of clean clothing
              every Saturday afternoon and facilities for bathing once a week; to see that no
              convict, under any contract, shall be worked more than twelve hours in any one day,
              and no convict is overworked, and to see that the Chaplain reside in the immediate
              vicinity of the prisons and devote their entire time to the moral and religous
              training of the convicts The Governor shall appoint one person from each Congressional
              District selecting from both political parties, to constitute a Commission on Prison
              Reform to report to the next General Assembly but the Commissioners shall receive no
              compensation for their services.</p>
            <p>Mr. HALL moved to amend the resolution by strikiug out the words "known as Visitor's
              Fund," and inserting "all moneys received from visitors. Also by adding after the
              words "whip or cat" the words "or any substitute therefor."</p>
            <p>Mr. WADGE accepted the amendments.</p>
            <p>Mr. DITTEMORE thought the latter part of the resolution relating to the management of
              the Prisons was out of order and should be left to the directors. As to the
              abolishment of the cat he thought it would be unfair and unjust to the State and to
              contracting parties.</p>
            <p>Mr. ORR believed that instead of beating the bad out of a man with the cat you beat
              the bad in.</p>
            <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM had been a contrrctor for years and knows that showering bucking and
              gaging etc., disables and incapacitates the convict from work for days. It is better
              to leave these things to directors. </p>
            <pb n="567" xml:id="VAA8558-14-567"/>
            <p>Mr. HALL, too, has been a contractor and had witnessed whippings until there was not
              a particle of manhood left in the convict. The man that lays hand on another with the
              whip brutalizes himself and the convict. The reason contractors oppose abolishing the
              whip is because the other means usually resorted to incapacitates the sufferer from
              work for several days. He asked Senators to accept and profit by the experience of
              Ohio where this thing was abolished ten years ago, and of Pennsylvania where it was
              abolished fifteen years since, and those States have never gone back to this unhuman,
              brutalizing thing of butchering men alive. He besought Senators to listen to the cry
              of mercy especially when it is so well known and so ferquently demonstrated that
              convicts can be governed better in other ways than by butchering.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. SLATER, the resolution and amendment was referred to the Committee
              on Judiciary, with instructions to report to-morrow morning at 9:30.</p>

            <head rend="center">MINES AND MINING.</head>
            <p>Mr. BEESON from a majority of the Committee on Mines and Mining, returned Senate bill
              No. 205, regulating coal mines, etc.; and recommended that all after the enacting
              clause be struck out and new matter inserted, authorizing the Governor to appoint an
              inspector and assistant inspector of Mines, with salaries of two thousand dollars and
              one thousand dollars, respectively, to hold office for two years.</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY, of Lawrence, presented a minority report, recommending that Senate bill
              No. 205 be laid on the table, and House bill No. 230 be passed. [The latter is a copy
              of the New York and Ohio law on the subject.]</p>
            <p>Mr. RINGO. The majority report is not exactly as I would like to have it; but the
              bill presented in the Senate is perhaps as just as any bill that will be presented at
              any time. That bill provides that the mine inspector shall be the State Geologist, who
              is a man not likely to be influenced by either party. The bill that passed the House
              of Representatives if it becomes a law; virtually shuts up the mining business in the
              State of Indiana. The miners now pretty nigh control the whole mining interest of our
              country - our operators having nothing to do but bring up the books and settle with
              the men; they even fix the price;they control the whole matter now. This is a subject
              of two much importance to be recklessly passed over. If we place this thing in the
              hands of the miners we virtually shut up the coal mining interests of the State. The
              mining interest and the manufacturing interests are growing in the State of Indiana,
              and we don't want to do anything to cripple it. I do hope the majority report will be
              concurred in although it is not exactly as I would like to have it.</p>
            <p>Mr. BEESON. The Senate bill makes provision in regard to what is called strikes; and
              I am satisfied from observation and inquiry that unless the Legislature takes some
              steps to avoid that difficulty the mining interests of the State of Indiana will be
              put beyond the reach of law. The House bill makes no provision for that. It is what is
              called "the miners bill." As far as the two bills is concerned relative to labor, etc.
              they are about identical; but the Senate bill contains a provision about strikes which
              I think is a wise and just one, for I have been creditably informed that in these
              mining districts a man cannot be employed unless he belongs to a miners union. For
              instance, when a man is hired unless he belongs to a union he is not allowed to work
              in the mines, and when he joins the union he is bound to get so much a day. That has
              been carried to that extent in the mining regions of Clay county, and unless there is
              something done, it looks to me like there will be serious trouble in the near future.
              The majority of the committee came to the conclusion that the Senate bill was the
              best, and although it is too late, perhaps, for it to become a law this session, yet
              they recognized the fact that an expression by the Legislature upon a subject as
              important as this should take a proper and right direction, and for that reason a
              majority of the committee report a bill they think is a proper one to be passed. There
              is not only the welfare of the mining interest concerned but the manufacturing
              interest is based upon the mining interest to a great extent, for the cheaper you can
              get coal and the more steady you can get the supply the more help you give the
              manufacturing establishments in Indiana.</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence. As long as the honorable Senator from Clay [Mr. Ringo] and
              Wayne [Mr. Beeson] have seen proper to refer to what was said before the committee, I
              desire to say that when complaints were made by the operators that the miners had
              formed unions for the purpose of protecting themselves against the orders, etc., of
              operators, it was charged by the miners that no union was ever formed in the State of
              Indiana until combinations had been first entered into by the operators of the mines.
              These men of capital controlling money by the million of dollars, united against the
              miners for the purpose of cutting down their wages. That charge was made before the
              committee; it was sustained by testimony before the committe, and it can be sustained
              by the very best evidence. The first organisation was by the operators themselves in
              the county of Clay, and in order to protect them- <pb n="568" xml:id="VAA8558-14-568"
              /> selves against the organization entered into by capitalists these men were forced
              to organize among themselves. After the capitalists have driven them into an
              organization for their own protection they come before the Legislature and complain of
              their organization. I am not one of those who want to cripple the mining interest; I
              would build it up : but I am not willing to place power in the hands of capitalists to
              grind down labor. That is what is sought to be done in the Senate bill, and I enter my
              solemn protest against this attempted legislation against these poor men who labor
              under ground. I want to know if you will not cripple the mining interest if you fail
              to give these men the same protection given by eastern States. Do you expect these men
              to work in the same way here unless they are protected as in other States.</p>
            <p>Mr. RINGO (interposing.) Does not this bill provide verbatim, as far as ventilation
              is concerned, the same as the House bill ?</p>
            <p>Mr. FRIEDLEY of Lawrence. No, sir, it does not, and I will take pleasure in
              point-ting out the difference when the bills are considered. I ask that the minority
              report may be fairly considered and that the miners may be heard in the Senate as
              before the Committee.</p>
            <p>Mr. COLLETT. It seems to me simply rediculous to think of putting the whole mining
              interests of Indiana under the control of the circuit judge of Clay county. The State
              of Indiana ought to take care of that interest. The laws necessary to control the
              mines in the east are not appliable here, etc., etc.,</p>
            <p>Mr. DITTEMORE. The House bill would work a great greiveance under the present system
              adopted by these miners strikes being made every month or two to regulate the prices
              of labor it is impossible for coal men to make any permanent contracts.</p>
            <p>Mr. SLATER. There have been many bills passed for the benefit of men of wealth, but
              now that we have a chance to do something for the poor laborer a cry comes up against
              such a measure. It does not come from men who in their early days have had to labor
              for a livelihood : for all know the rich men can take care of themselves without the
              help of unions. I shall call the yeas and nays upop every question of this kind, and
              Senators have got to slow whether they favor the rich men or the poor men in this
              case.</p>
            <p>On Mr. Chapman's motion the minority report was laid on the table by yeas 35, nays
              7.</p>
            <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
            <p>Mr. BIRD, when his name was called in explanation of his vote, said: I think it too
              late to interfere with the unions of miners. It is better for the Senate to say
              nothing about it. I think it would be a bad precedent and therefore I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: These
              operatiors are able to take care of themselves. Sometimes they become oppresive and
              overbearing. I prefer to stand by men in the ordinary position in life who have no
              money to protect themselves; therefore I stand by the minority report.</p>
            <p>Mr. DWIGGINS, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I don't
              think it proper to adopt any measure on this subject.</p>
            <p>Mr. HARNEY, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: Members of
              unions have the right to work when they choose, but no right to control the action of
              others. I understood this Senate bill contains a provision that when they attempt to
              control others not members of the union they are amendable to law, therefore I vote
              "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. ORR in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: I am not in favor
              of legislating exclusively for or against the poor, or for or against the rich. I want
              to legislate for the peace and happiness and welfare of all classes. I think if I vote
              "no" I would not be carrying out that principle therefore I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT, in explanation his of vote, when his name was called, said: I am well
              convinced that at this late hour of the session the attempt to settle miners strikes
              is absurd. I cannot determine between the merits of these bills therefore I will vote
              to lay the minority report on the table and will do the same thing with the other.Mr.
              SMITH, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: relying on the
              remarks of the Senator from Wayne [Mr. Beeson] and Clay [Mr. Ringo] believing they
              understand the matter, I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. THOMPSON. This is really an interesting subject to cities and persons who consume
              coal. I hope the Senate will so legislate as to protect the poor people of cities from
              the evils of strikes in the coal mines that stops the machienery and imposes terrible
              suffering upon the poor.</p>

              of the session it is nearly impossible to do justice to this question involved in
              these two bills. But there is another consideration ; if there is a subject of
              legislation brought up it is proper to have the expression given in the right
              direction. In this case I believe that right direction is expressed in the bill
              reported by the major- of the Committee and for that reason I vote against laying it
              on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. BROWN, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I agree with
              the Senator from Vigo [Mr. Scott] that a subject of so much importance cannot be
              carefully considered at this late day in the session and think we had better let the
              matter alone than to make a passable blunder.</p>
            <p>Mr. COLLETT, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: As it is late
              in the session I will vote to lay my own report on the table.</p>

              hundred dollars.</p>
            <p>Mr. SLATER moved to am^nd by making it two thousand dollars.</p>
            <p>This motion was rejected by yeas 19, nays 25.</p>
            <p>Pending the roll call.</p>
            <p>Mr. HARNEY said: there is great force in the argument that this is not a proper time
              to increase the salaries of public officers because there is a general decline in the
              products of labor. There is also another fact that is equally clear and that is that
              there is a great increase in the value of high intellectual labor of the very class
              that the State wants in her service. For this kind of service we have to compete with
              private enterprise - with corporations and with the Federal government.</p>
            <p>The avenues for obtaining wealth are varied and open to all, and of course are first
              seized by the intellectual and enterprising. In fact if money consideration were the
              only inducement, the State could not secure to its service the best talent it
              posesses. Again the general governments is holding out great inducements to the best
              talent we have to enter its service, while corporations are not behind in contending
              for the best talent to enter its service.</p>
            <p>Now, sir, the proposition needs no argument to sustain it. That the security honor
              and dignity of the State depends upon its great men. Men great in intellect, culture,
              morals, and industry. Great wealth may serve only to overate a people or incite
              barbarians to prey upon its riches. A dense population may tend only to anarchy, or
              more often results in absolute despotism; while there are the true elements of
              grateness when we have the nerve and intellect to control them. This the State must
              have in its service. Heretofore we have been successful more on account of an
              honorable ambition upon the part of our leading men to serve the public than the
              pecuniary inducements offered. But this can not always remain so when corporations
              offer twice as much for the same service as the State is willing to give. Our Supreme
              Court is the august tribunal of the State; its decissions are the law of the land. It
              passes upon every question that effects the people of the State and in both corporate
              and individual, and certainly there is wisdom in retaing in that honored position the
              highest talent in the State, providing for their support in such a generous manner
              that there could be no presumption of there being governed by any but the purest
              motive. In this vote I treat the public interest just as I would my own. I propose to
              employ the best talent and pay such compensation as that class of services are worth
              in any other department of business.</p>
            <p>Mr. HOUGH, in explanation of his vote, when his name wsa called, said : With the
              number of Circuit Judges increased and additional Judges elected to take the place of
              the Common Pleas judges, we will have a greater number of judges in five years than we
              have ever had in Indiana, and until we know how our Judiciary is to be manned we
              should not increase the salaries. In five years our judicial salaries will cost not
              less than one hundred thousand dollars annually; more than ever before.</p>
            <p>Mr. NEFF, by way of explaning his vote when his name was called said : While we had
              before us the consideration of this question in connection with the increase of salary
              for common pleas judges I believed then the salary of that officer was too low.
              Fifteen hundred dollars per year will not command such talent as should be demanded by
              the people. I was in favor of increasing that officers salary commensurate with the
              labor he was required to perform: but the whole judicial system has been changed, the
              common Pleas Courts have <pb n="570" xml:id="VAA8558-14-570"/> been abolished, the
              number of judicial circuits have very nearly been doubled, and now we are asked to
              increase the salary of the circuit judges very largely without waiting to ascertain
              the amount of labor they have to perform. But there is another objection still more
              serious in the way, and that is the final disposition of the probate business. In my
              judgment at the next session the friends of this bill will demand that the probate
              business be taken away from the Circuit court and a distinct tribunal be organized for
              the settlement and determination of this branch of business having therefore before my
              mind this change I could not consent to increase the salary of this officer without
              first knowing the amount of labor to be performed and the time to do the labor
              required.</p>
            <p>Mr. ORR, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: Inasmuch as the
              salary gives them about eight dollars a day for the discharge of their duties. I vote
              "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. ROSEBRUGH in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: I have been
              absent quite a good part of the session and was in favor of a small increase in the
              salaries until my recent stay at home. I was enabled to find during the time I was
              there only one or two persons in favor of increasing the judges salaries. While I
              would be personally willing to give some increase, I think it my duty to represent the
              wishes of the people who placed me here. I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. SMITH, in explanation of his vote when his name was called said: A man who sits
              upon the bench should have a good salary. My impression is that two thousand dollars
              is not enough therefore I vote "no."When the roll call was completed - </p>

            <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
            <p>Mr. BOONE, when his name was "called, in explanation of his vote said: We are in
              chaos as regards our judicial system and until we know what the result will be I am
              not inclined to vote for an increase of salaries. I vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. GLESSNER, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said. It is stated
              that the judicial system is in chaos but we know we have required the judges to sit
              nearly the entire year and the compensation of a pledge is the smallest part of the
              expense connected with his court. If you want efficiency and capacity you must give
              sufficient compensation to secure those qualities we are asking men to a bandon every
              other business and devote their entire time to the bench, and when it comes to
              compensating these men we ought not to hesitate to pay them liberally. I vote
              "no,"</p>
            <p>Mr. GOODING, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: It seems to
              me we are not doing an extravagant thing when we vote three thousand dollars a year.
              Some gentleman say we will have a different state of things in five years from now,
              and that we will have more judges than now. Many of us think we will need no more
              judges for several years. Some gentlemen say we will have a surrogate system in five
              years, and are opposed to raising the salaries of judges now because they have
              nothing: to do. If our judges have time to spare there is no need of a surrogate
              system; so the two arguments don't hang together. If judges are over worked they ought
              to to well paid, and if there is more work than they can do we ought to have a
              surrogate system. I think, sir, we will find this state of things existing: that our
              present judges will resign if we don't raise their salaries. I vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. HUBBARD, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I don't
              think three thousand dollars a year, is a cent too much to give a judge who is
              competent to sit on the bench, and for fear we will not get as much I vote "aye" on
              this amendment.Mr. ORR, in explanation of his vote when his name was called said: If
              the amendment of the senator from Johnson [Mr. Slater] had been adopted I could vote
              for thii bill heartily but as this is the only thing to fall back on I will have to
              vote for it. Senators say we can't get talent without a pile of money but I tell you
              the best talent in the State sit on the bench at two thousand dollars a year and they
              won't resign. I vole "aye."</p>
            <p>Mr. RHODES in explanation of his vote when his name was called said: From the stand
              point I take I do not think three thousand dollars is too much. I look at it in this
              way: What compensation ought we to give a man properly qualified to discharge the
              duties of the office ? Our circuit judgea have been working for two thousand dollars
              and Common Pleas judges for fifteen hundred dollars. From what I know these salar- <pb
                n="571" xml:id="VAA8558-14-571"/>ries have been too low. We have under a system of
              low pay had ineffiicient judges in some cases and we will never change this state of
              affairs until we change the compensation. There is not a lawyer anywhere of
              respectability but who can command a practice of three thousand dollars. I think it is
              policy and economy, and wisdom on the part of the Legislature to pay these men what
              their services are fairly worth. I vote "no."</p>
            <p>Mr. RINGO, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I have been
              inclined to vote for three thousand dollars but when I see the Senators from Putman
              [Mr. Daggy] and St. Joseph [Mr. Hubbard] disposed to take the responsibility of voting
              for two thousand five hundred dollars I believe I will vote so too.</p>
            <p>Mr. HUBBARD (interposing.) Will you change your if vote I do mine ?</p>
            <p>Mr. RINGO. Not just yet.</p>
            <p>Mr. SMITH, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: It strikes me
              that three thousand dollars is a very small compensation for some of the judges on the
              bench; but I will vote "aye" for fear we can't get more.</p>
            <p>Mr. STEELE, when his name was called in explanation of his vote said: It is pretty
              well known that I have been decidedly in favor of an increase of salaries but not of
              abolishing the common Pleas court, believing it would finally inflict upon the country
              a large increase of the Judiciary. I believe so yet. I believe that in two years from
              now there will he something like a surrogate system and probate judges established in
              this country and that will cost another one hundred thousand dollars. I am in favor of
              increasing the salaries of Supreme judges. It is shown by the vote of the Senate on
              the motion of the Senator from Johnson [Mr. Slater] that the Senate is not satisfied
              with two thousand dollars for the circuit judges and now rather than we should be
              driven to the necessity of adopting three thousand dollars, I shall vote for this
              amendment offer by the Senator from Rush [Mr. Sleeth.] I vote "aye."</p>
            <p>When the roll call was completed - </p>
            <p>The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.</p>
            <p>So the motion to concur in the House amendments by reducing the salary of circuit

                  concurring therein, that human life is inviolable that the death penalty is
                  vindictive to the criminal, demoralizing to society, inadequate as a remedy, and
                  inimical to Christian civilization and therefore it should be abolished, and
                  imprisonment substituted therefor. </p>

          <p> Cries of "no," "no !" were heard in various parts of the House as the clerk finished
            reading the resolution, whereupon - </p>
          <p>Mr. BAXTER rose and addressed the House, in substance nearly as follows :</p>
          <p>Mr. Speaker : I hear the cry of no, no, no, proceed from several parts of the House.
            Surely the gentlemen who say "no," have not investigated this subject, or they would not
            offer such a hasty and inconsiderate protest. Reason, facts and experience all
            demonstrate that the gallows is utterly inefficient to restrain crime - nay more, that
            it actually stimulates criminal purposes. If there is any act of our government which
            evinces a spirit of barbarism, and which is opposed to good order, civilization and the
            genius of Christianity, it is that of hanging a person by the neck until he is dead.</p>
          <p>What reason have the advocates of the gallows to offer in justification for this relic
            of barbarism? First, that justice demands that life shall be sacrificed for life;
            second, that the death penalty is necessary for the security of society; third, that
            execution deter others from committing murder.</p>
          <p>Let us glance for a moment at these reasons : First then, these apologists for the
            gallows say, that justice demands "life for life." I answer, if taking away the
            murderer's life would restore his victim to society, or if it would serve as an act of
            restitution to the bereved family, then there might be some plea of justice for the
            death penalty. But it utterly fails in both these important purposes. Hence it does
            gross violence to society without producing any corresponding good, and therefore should
            be abandoned. If murder be wrong in the individual how can a judicial murder by the
            State be right? The offender almost invariably commits murder under the influence of the
            spirit of revenge for some supposed wrong. The State commits murder under the spirit of
            retaliation. If the former be morally wrong the latter certainly cannot be morally
            right. Again, if the State be justified in taking life for life ; by the same rule of
            action the State should burn the house of the incendiary, because he has destroyed his
            neighbors house, or when a man willfully and brutally maltreats and maims another, then
            the la* should employ its officers, in turn, to brutally maltreat and maim the offender.
            Does the law do this? No, why? Because such <pb n="573" xml:id="VAA8558-14-573"/> a
            course would not only fail to answer the ends of justice, but it would degrade and
            demoralize society. Instead, however of pursuing such a foolish and suicidal course, the
            law wisely fines and imprisons the offender for these abuses. In this way the State is
            far more likely to secure the ends of justice. Why not apply similar treatment to the
            murderer ? If the rule holds good in the former instances why not in the latter ?
            Certainly it ought, and I am persuaded that such a policy would be more efficient in
            repressing crime than for the State to exact "life for life."</p>
          <p>But again, I ask, have governments the right to take human life? They have not, for the
            reason that no man has the right to take his own life. All righteous governments derive
            their powers from the persons governed. As however none possess the inherent right to
            take away their own lives, so they cannot delegate such rights to others. How can they
            delegate to others what they do not themselves possess ? They can not. Hence legislators
            will have no right to enact laws to take away human life. To borrow the language of Dr.
            Benjamin Rush, "the power over human life is the sole prerogative of Him who gave it.
            Human laws, therefore, are in rebellion against the prerogative, when they transmit it
            to human hands."</p>
          <p>A secend reason given by those who believe in capital punishment is, that of the right
            of self defence, that the security of society depends on the rigid enforcement of the
            death penalty. In answer. I reply, that society is by no means so dependant for its
            security. Were we living in a pastoral state, dwelling in tents and leading nomadic
            lives, there might be some force in the plea ; but in this age of the world's progress,
            when civilization and Christianity, have prepared the way for a higher mental and moral
            condition - when all the necessary restraints upon criminal action are within our
            keeping - when prisons, reformatories and asylums are co-existent with every government,
            the absurdity of hanging the criminal, as a protection to society, must be obvious to
            every thinking person.</p>
          <p>It cannot therefore be successfully maintained, that the execution of the murderer is
            necessary to the protection of society, any more than it can be maintained that it is
            neeessary to execute the maniac, who may be far more dangerous to life than the ordinary
            murderer. We place the maniac within the walls of an asylum for the protection of
            society, as well as for the care which its sanitary measures afford. Hence as we do not
            hang the maniac, some feeling must actuate us other than self defence, when we consign
            the murderer to the gallows. To hang the criminal because you suspect he might repeat
            his crime under similar circumstances, would be to punish, not a crime, nor even the
            intention to commit it, but a possible liability to yield to a future temptation which
            may never assail him. I submit therefore, that it would be far more in accordance with
            right, reason, humanity and civilization, to treat the criminal as you treat the maniac.
            Instead of resorting to the barbarism of the gallows to hurry him out of the world, and
            most probably unprepared for the next, let the State place him under confinement,
            subject him to all those rules of physical, mental and moral discipline which would tend
            to root out the evil passions of his nature, and to supplant them with the nobler
            impulses of humanity and civilization. By this means he might ultimately be in a
            condition to offer some restitution to society for the great wrong he had done to
            it.</p>
          <p>But capital punishment forever precludes such a possibility. And right here let me
            remark, it is a remarkable fact, which a long course, of observation proves, that, as a
            general rule those criminals who have committed murder are governed with less trouble,
            and seem to be more susceptible of moral influence, than other felons. This may be
            accounted for by the fact that many murders are committed through sudden impulse, or
            when in a state of intoxication; whereas the majority of other felons have pursued a
            successive course of crime, and thereby have become hardened in their dispositions. We
            should never forget that many, very many of those unfortunate criminals, are the sad
            victims of a depraved education, hence they demand the commiseration and moral influence
            of our nobler manhood, rather than the vindictive spirit of a barbarous institution.</p>
          <p>We build Houses of Refuge and Reformatories for the unfortunate "waifs of society,'*
            who have committed minor offenses, and apply to them all the sanitary, mental and moral
            influences we possess, to reform and elevate their character. In this labor we are
            developing a noble work of civilization and Christian morality.</p>
          <p>Now, I submit, that if this course be right and proper towards the minor criminal, how
            much more does it become our duty as benefactors of the race, to extend even more
            protection, instruction and moral training, towards those who have been so unfortunate
            as to commit a greater crime ? But no, instead of carrying out our beneficient labor and
            spirit to its legitimate end, we suddenly stop short, and transform ourselves from the
            condition of angels of humanity and peace, to agents of darkness, cruelty and death. Is
            there any consistency, humanity, civilization or Christian philanthropy in this ? If
            there is I confess that I fail to see it.</p>
          <pb n="574" xml:id="VAA8558-14-574"/>
          <p>The third reason offered by the apologist for the gallows, is, that executions serve to
            deter people from commiting murder. Were this reason correct in principle, then
            executions to be more effective in detering crime, should be made as public as possible.
            But public execution are almost totally ignored. The time was when the unhappy culprit
            was dragged through the streets on a hurdle, accompanied by the officials; the clergy, a
            military escort, and preceded by a band of music, discoursing dead marches and funeral
            dirges, in order to render the performance all the more public and imposing - and many
            of the victims, after being hung by the neck until they were dead, were fastened to
            gibbets, and taken to the cross roads, there to remain to be gazed upon by every passer
            by, as a terror to evil doers. Why were these public exhibitions of barbarism abandoned
            ? Because they not only shocked public conscience, but because experience conclusively
            demonstrated, that instead of repressing crime they positively engendered it. Hence
            nearly every civilized nation has abandoned public execution. Dr. Livington well
            understood the subject, when he declared in the British Parliament, that "every
            execution brings an additional candidate for the hangman."</p>
          <p>"Woe to society," declared Lepelletier, "if, in that multitude which gazed eagerly on
            an execution, is found one of those beings predisposed to crime, by his education and
            the perverseness of his propensity. His instinct, like that of the wild beast, awaits,
            perhaps only the sight of blood to awake; and already his heart hardened to murder, the
            moment he is quitting the spot wet with the blood which the sword of the law has shed."
            Innumerable are the instances where public executions have been attended with scenes of
            the most revolting brutality. The hanging of Dr. Pritchard at Glasgow, and of Muller in
            London, were each followed by about a dozen murders and foul attempts at murder. If my
            memory is correct, three murders occurred almost in sight of the gallows, at an
            execution in Kentucky some years ago. A man was executed in the State of Ohio for the
            murder of his wife, under circumstances of peculiar cruelty. The day on which the
            execution took place, another man man near the place of execution, murdered his wife in
            the same manner.</p>
          <p>Thus it is abundantly demonstrated by facts and long experience, that the law of
            capital punishment, when executed can have no other effect upon the criminally inclined,
            than to arouse the bloody instincts, and to excite those baser propensities which are
            the dark precursors of bloody deeds. The very spirit of the gallows is infectious. Men
            have been known to return home from executions and deliberately hang themselves. The
            testimony is overwhelming, that the gallows ever incites to crime, and is, in no case,
            pro-motive of public virtue. As harshness and brutality in individuals begets a kindred
            spririt in their associates, so barbarism in a Government engenders crime and barbarism
            in the subject. This action is as certain to follow as the laws which govern the
            universe.</p>
          <p>It is not therefore by capital punishment that you can deter and lessen crime. You may
            use all the hemp in Russia - you may hang and gibbet criminals at the corner of all your
            public thoroghfares, until their bodies decompose in the air, and still you will utterly
            fail by such a barbarous course to remove crime. Nay verily, by such a a course you will
            feed the appetite for blood and cruelty.</p>
          <p>That noble and most eloquent advocate of human rights, John Bright, well says: "A deep
            reverence for human life is worth more than a thousand executions in the prevention of
            murder; and is in fact the great security for human life." As an evidence of the truth
            of this sentiment, the "Society of Friends " has taught for more than two centuries, the
            inviolability of human life, and as a result of this teaching, no member of that society
            has ever been known to commit murder.</p>
          <p>By the Pursian law it was forbidden to put to death a Roman citizen. This law continued
            in force two hundred years, and Montesquien says: "It was never observed that this step
            did any manner of prejudice to the civil administration." Was it a "morbid sensibility"
            that originated and perpetuated this law? The unrelenting sternness of the Roman
            character is too well known to admit this favorite suggestion of a sanguinary code.
            Cicero thus bears his testimony to the noble sentiment upon which the Pursian law was
            founded. "Far be from us the punishment of death - its ministers - its instruments.
            Remove them not only from actual operation on our bodies, but banish them from our eyes,
            our ears and thoughts; for not only the execution, but the appresension, the existence,
            the very mention of these things is disgraceful to a freeman, to a Roman citizen." How
            much more disgraceful then ought it to be to an American citizen with all the
            civilization of the past before his eyes ?</p>
          <p>In Tuscany during twenty years, the punishment of death was altogether abolished by
            Duke Leopold. Bonaparte afterwards restored it. Our comparing these successive periods
            of twenty years each, in the first period capital punishment existing, in the second
            period abolished, and in the third again restored, as above mentioned, it is found that
              <pb n="575" xml:id="VAA8558-14-575"/> fewer crimes and fewer murders were perpetrated
            in the middle twenty years, while no executions took place, than in either the
            preceeding or succeeding twenty years while the scaffold was in use.</p>
          <p>When Sir James Macintash was Recorder of Bombay, capital punishments were suspended for
            seven years. The number of murders diminished during that period to six. Whereas, during
            the proceeding seven years, there had been eighteen convicted for murder, and twelve
            executions.</p>
          <p>These facts are fully borne out by experience in our own country. In the State of New
            York where capital punishment is the law, it appears from the statement of the "New York
            Times," that in the city of New York there occurred one hundred and forty-one murders in
            three years. While in the State of Michigan, where imprisonment has been substituted for
            the gallows, and with a population fully as large as New York City, there have been only
            sixty murders in twenty-seven years. Rhode Island, Wisconsin and other places where
            capital punishment has been abolished, afford similar evidence.</p>
          <p>Startling as these facts may appear to many of the members of this House, they are not
            at all surprising to those who have directed their attention to reformatory measures.
            Beccaria declared more than a century ago that, "it is the certainty rather than the
            severity of the punishment, which constitutes its efficiency." With the law of capital
            punishment on the statute book, it is almost impossible to convict and punish, even
            though we resort to exception and restrictions in impanneling a jury for the trial of
            murder, which we do not exact in the trial of any other crime. Men shudder at the
            consequence of a verdict for murder. And no wonder when we have the solemn fact staring
            us full in the face, that out of ten thousand executions, nearly five hundred of these
            have been proved by subsequent revelation of facts, to have been innocent victims of
            this most barbarous of practices. As a consequence, there is the notorious fact, that
            out of the one hundred and forty-one murderers committed in New York in three years only
            one was executed. On the other hand, we find, that in these States where imprisonment
            has been substituted for the gallows, conviction is a certainty in almost every
            instance. Surely then it is far more efficient for the prevention and suppression of
            crime to have imprisonment with certainty of conviction, than the gallows with an almost
            certainty of escape from punishment. Were I disposed to commit a murder, I would sooner
            select New York than Michigan to accomplish the deed of blood, simply because in the
            former State there are one hundred and forty cases, to one, that I should not be
            convicted and punished, whereas in Michigan conviction after murder amounts almost to a
            certainty.</p>
          <p>Hence I contend that reason, experience and national policy alike demonstrate, that
            "the death penalty is demoralizing to society, inadequate as a remedy, and inimical to
            Christian civilization," and therefore should be abolished by every civilized
            community.</p>
          <p>If our State wishes to restrain crime it must remove the causes which produce crime. It
            must close the run shop, the gambling saloon and the haunts of sensuality and vice. It
            must teach the rising generation lessons of industry and frugality. The people must be
            educated to a higher civilization - a civilization founded on Christian virtue. It is by
            refining and elevating the moral feelings by benificient laws and not by barbarizing the
            baser propensities of our nature with the use of the gallows, that a Government can
            remove crime from its borders. The more, therefore we keep before our minds, the noble
            spirit embodied in our State Constitution, that " the penal code should be founded on
            the principles of reformation and not of vindictive justice," the more surely will crime
            disappear from among us, and the more surely shall we advance in that career of moral
            purity and granduer which is the strongest bulwark of the progress, the prosperity and
            of the happiness of a free people. I shall therefore vote "aye" on the resolution before
            the House.</p>

        <p>THE journals of the business of both Houses as well as the debates, almost every day of
          the session were marred by the diminutions practiced in the office of the Indianapolis
          DAILY SENTINEL, for which these reports were originally furnished under a contract
          designed to provide against such interferences.</p>
        <p>THE reference to the Appendix on page 196 et seg. for the debate on Mr. Kimball's
          Committee bill H. R. 350 to organize Insurance Companies and to regulate the business of
          Insurance Companies etc., requires a statement. It has been thought best not to publish
          that debate because Mr. Wilson of Ripley, who took the largest part therein, neglects to
          authenticate and return the report of his speeches, The "five minutes rule" also began to
          restrain debate at the time this subject was pending. Otherwise the volume might have
          exceeded the amount of matter to which the reporters have restricted themselves throughout
          the series.</p>
        <p>Page 101 should be in the place of 102 and page 102 should be in the place of 101.The

          </p>
          <p>The hope expressed at the close of the address delivered to you at the commencement of
            the late special session, that your deliberations during that session might be
            characterized by harmony and be fruitful of good legislation, I am happy to say, was
            realized. Since my connection with public affairs, I have never witnessed a session of
            the General Assembly in which a more intelligent appreciation of duty was manifested;
            and in point of industry the late session, in my judgment, excelled any of its
            predecessors. This will not be understood as an idle compliment on the one hand, or as
            an unqualified indorsement of every act that was passed at the late session on the
            other. In welcoming you for the last time to this seat of legislation, I sincerely
            congratulate you in view of what you have already accomplished, and trust that during
            your present session you will be guided by that wisdom which cometh from above, and
            which is profitable to direct.</p>

          <p>If immediate provision be made, as in my judgment there should be, for the enlargement
            of the House of Refuge, and the Institution for the Education of the Blind, and for the
            completion of the Female Reformatory, the above balance will not only be exhausted, but
            a deficiency will be created of over $100,000. It must be remembered that the act
            providing for the payment of the old bonds already mentioned, may add a considerable sum
            to this deficiency; and it is possible that the 5 and 2 per cent. stocks still
            outstanding to the amount of $36,930.12, or some considerable part thereof may be
            presented for redemption during the current year, and if so, they must be paid.</p>
          <p>In view of all this, and of the pressing demand that exists for making increased
            provision for the insane, it will be necessary in my judgment to levy a State tax for
            each of the years 1873 and 1874, of fifteen cents on the $100 of the taxables of the
            State. The collection of the revenue of 1873, will also have to be anticipated by a
            temporary loan, and the commencement of a new Hospital for the Insane will probably have
            to be deferred until the revenue of 1873 can be made available.</p>

            should give much of his time to the business of the State, and the result is that such
            business as naturally falls within the scope of his office must be either neglected or
            entrusted to other lawyers at an expense greater for each year than would be expended if
            an adequate salary were allowed to justify and require the residence of the Attorney
            General at the capitol, and the giving of his whole time to the duties of the office. I
            therefore respectfully recommend that the law governing the office of the Attorney
            General be so remodeled as to make the following provisions, viz :</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">First.</hi> That the Attorney General be required to reside at the State
            Capitol and keep an office there, and that he shall on all business days, during
            business hours, be at said office in person or by deputy, except when he shall be
            engaged in court or elsewhere in the service of the State.</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">Second.</hi> Requiring him to attend to the State's interests in all
            actions in which the State is interested (criminal prosecutions excepted,) whether the
            State shall be a party to such actions or not, and authorizing the Governor or a
            majority of the other State officers, to direct the Attorney General to perform such
            duty in any particular case.</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">Third.</hi> Requiring the Attorney General to give his legal opinion to
            the Governor, whenever requested so to do, touching any question or point of law in
            which the interests of the State may be involved, and to any other State officer,
            touching any point or question of law concerning the duty of such officer. Also, to
            either House of the General Assembly as to the constitutionality of any existing or
            proposed law, whenever requested so to do by resolution of such House.</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">Fourth.</hi> Giving the Attorney General a supervisory care over all the
            prosecuting and district attorney's throughout the State, and requiring the latter to
            report to the former, at stated periods all fines assessed and recognizances forfeited
            in the several courts within their respective circuits and districts, and requiring the
            Attorney General to keep a record of all such fines and forfei- <pb n="[7]"
              xml:id="VAA8558-14-599"/> tures alphabetically arranged by counties, and of the steps
            taken from time to time for the collection thereof. Also, requiring such prosecuting and
            district attorneys to report to the Attorney General from time to time the statistics of
            crime and criminal prosecutions, and of divorces granted and refused by the several
            courts in their respective circuits and districts.</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">Fifth.</hi> Requiring the Attorney General to report annually to the
            Secretary of State the statistics thus collected.</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">Sixth.</hi> Authorizing the Attorney General upon the direction of the
            Governor to appear as the prosecuting officer of the State in any criminal prosecution
            in any court within the State, and to assume charge of such prosecution either with or
            without the assistance of the circuit or district prosecutor, and to prosecute the same
            for and on behalf of the State.</p>
          <p>The necessity of some such provision as the one last mentioned is manifest, when it is
            remembered that the Constitution of the State makes it the duty of the Governor "to take
            care that the laws be faithfully executed," but so far as executing or aiding in
            executing the penal laws through the courts is concerned, he is under existing
            legislation, left without means to perform this constitutional duty. If a mob should
            defy the laws of the State and execute lynch law on any portion of its citizens, the
            Governor may call out the power of the State to suppress the violence and restore order.
            But when this is accomplished the prosecution of such violators of the public peace can
            only be carried on through the local prosecuting officers, although these officers may
            be in sympathy with or in fear of the very men to be prosecuted. In such cases, and in
            many others, which might be instanced, the Governor, to enable him to obey the
            constitutional injunction before mentioned, ought to have the power to direct the chief
            law officer of the State to appear in any court and assume the prosecution of any person
            charged with crime against the laws of the State.</p>
          <p>Of course the changes above indicated would necessitate a very considerable increase in
            the salary of the Attorney General, but this would be compensated fifty-fold by the
            increase of the school fund, by the collection of fines and forfeitures that are lost to
            the State under the present system. The opinion of the Attorney General should also be
            required to be given to the Governor as to the propriety or impropriety of remitting
            each fine and forfeiture for the remission of which application may be made.</p>

          <head rend="center">BUREAU OF STATISTICS.</head>
          <p>In this connection, I desire to call your special attention to the necessity for the
            establishment of a Bureau of Statistics, in connection with the Secretary of State's
            office. The Governor, and other State officers are, every year and sometimes many times
            in a year, called upon for statistical information by the different departments of the
            General Government, and by the governments of foreign countries, on some or all of the
            subjects usually embraced within the operations of such a Bureau, and are subjected to
            the mortifying necessity of being compelled to reply that Indiana collects no
            statistics, and can, therefore, impart no statistical information. It is as
            preposterous, in this age of the world, to attempt to legislate wisely and well for a
            State and its inhabitants without full statistical information, as it would be to
            conduct extended business operations without keeping an account of bills payable and
            receivable. I therefore recommend the establishment of a Bureau of Statistics, under the
            supervision of the Secretary of State, and that provision be made in connection
            therewith for encouraging immigration by publishing such statistical information as will
            make known the resources and advantages which this State offers to those in search of
            homes.</p>
          <p>The office of Secretary of State, I will here suggest, ought to be reconstructed by
            dividing it into Bureaus, and allowing an increase of clerical force.</p>

          <head rend="center">EDUCATION OF FEEBLE-MINDED AND IDIOTIC CHILDREN.</head>
          <p>There is also an urgent necessity for the establishment of a school for the education
            of idiotic and feeble-minded children. The success of such institutions in other States
            places their utility beyond doubt, I would recommend the inauguration of an experimental
            school at a small cost in the first instance, as was done in Illinois, feeling assured
            that the experiment would soon demonstrate, as it did in that State, the necessity of a
            permanent institution for the class of children just mentioned. A bill was matured two
            years ago, but was not passed, and I understand that substantially the same bill was
            again introduced at the special session, and is now pending. I trust it will become a
            law before your session shall close. Before dismissing the subject, I desire to call
            your attention to the fact, that the Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb
            has a tract of land containing about thirty-six acres situated south of the Michigan <pb
              n="[9]" xml:id="VAA8558-14-601"/> road, which is not now and can not be in the future,
            necessary for the purposes of that Institution, the same being separated from the
            grounds on which the buildings of the Institution stand by several railroad tracks. I am
            informed that this land, if sold for one-fourth cash and the residue in four equal
            annual payments, with interest at six per cent., would bring $75,000. I know of no
            better purpose to which the proceeds of the surplus lands of the Institution for the
            Deaf and Dumb could be applied than to the founding of an institution for the education
            of idiotic and feeble-minded children. I therefore recommend that authority be given to
            the trustees of the Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb to sell the land
            before mentioned on the terms above indicated, and that said trustees before making any
            sale be required to advertise for sealed bids for the land, such bids to be opened in
            the presence of the Governor, and the sale to be subject fo his approval. I further
            recommend that a portion of the proceeds be applied, first, to the opening of an
            experimental school, and that ultimately the residue of such proceeds, if the experiment
            shall be successful, be applied to the establishment of the institution on a permanent
            foundation.</p>

            ample opportunity to inform yourselves of the progress which our system of public
            schools has made during the last two years. I am gratified to be able to say, however,
            that one marked evidence of progress is the fact that the average school term has, since
            1867, been prolonged thirty-three days in the year, and that more than the half of this
            increase in the length of the school year occurred in 1872. I commend the common school

            branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, expired in
            July last, and the college not being opened, the State, by the letter of the law, has
            forfeited the grant, and is liable to be called upon by the General Government to refund
            the amount received. There is no probability <pb n="[10]" xml:id="VAA8558-14-602"/> that
            such a demand will be made, but it is highly important that the General Assembly should
            memorialize Congress to waive the forfeiture and grant further time to the Trustees of
            Purdue University in which to put the college in operation. I therefore recommend that a

            upon the treasury of the State having passed two successive General Assemblies, is now

            amendment to the people for ratification, and also in relation to the calling of a
            convention to make a thorough revision of the Constitution ; that is to say: Let an act

          <p><hi rend="i">First.</hi> For submitting said proposed amendment to the people for
            ratification, at an election to be held on the second Tuesday in October, 1873.</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">Second.</hi> Providing further for the election, at the same election, of
            delegates to a constitutional convention to revise the Constitution.</p>
          <p><hi rend="i">Third.</hi> Providing still further, that at the same election the
            question whether a constitutional convention shall be convened or not, shall be
            submitted to a direct vote of the people, and that if a majority of all the votes cast
            on the question at such election shall be in favor of the calling of a convention, then
            the convention shall meet as may be provided for in the act, but that if a majority of
            said votes shall be against a convention, then no convention shall meet in pursuance of
            the provisions of the act, and the election of delegates shall, by reason of such
            adverse vote, become null and void.</p>
          <p>By this plan the expense of but one election would be incurred, and yet all the

          <p>In February, 1871, and just after the session of the General Assembly of that year had
            terminated, I received a communication from his Excellency, R. B. Hayes, Governor of
            Ohio, transmitting to me a joint resolution of the General Assembly of the State of Ohio
            in relation to the construction and maintenance of the Wabasll and Erie Canal within the
            State of Indiana, and requesting me to communicate the same to the General Assembly of
            this State. I accordingly herewith submit for your consideration the said joint
            resolution, with the letter of Gov. Hayes transmitting it to me.</p>
          <pb n="[13]" xml:id="VAA8558-14-605"/>
          <p>I beg leave to say that the Ohio joint resolution assumes the making of a compact or
            stipulation by Indiana to or with Ohio that Indiana would perpetually keep in repair and
            in good navigable order, so much of the Wabash and Erie Canal as is situated in Indiana,
            and calls upon this State to perform the supposed compact. The answer to this complaint
            is that the assumption that such a compact ever existed or was made by Indiana, is
            unsupported by the facts. No such compact ever was made by Indiana with Ohio. The
            agreement made in 1829, by Jeremiah Sullivan on the part of this State, and Wyllys
            Silliman on the part of Ohio, recited in the Ohio joint resolution, never was ratified
            by either of said States, and, therefore, never took effect or became binding on said
            Stakes, or either of them. The only agreement or arrangement of any kind between the two
            States is that contained in the joint resolution of the General Assembly of Indiana, of
            February 1, 1834, and in the acceptance of the arrangement proposed thereby by the joint
            resolution of Ohio, passed February 24, 1834. By the Indiana joint resolution, this
            State relinquished and conveyed to the State of Ohio certain lands ceded to this State
            by Congress, in consideration and on condition that Ohio should construct and keep in
            repair a canal from the Ohio and Indiana line to a point as low down the Maumee river
            toward Lake Erie as the towns of Maumee and Perrysburgh, and in consideration that Ohio
            should perform divers other stipulations contained in the Indiana joint resolution.
            Ohio, by her joint resolution of February 24, 1834, accepted the terms of the Indiana
            joint resolution, and the two joint resolutions contain the only contract made between
            the two States. This contract was wholly an executed contract on the part of Indiana,
            and executory on the part of Ohio; and it was impossible for Indiana ever to be guilty
            of a breach of the contract, because it was wholly executed, so far as she was
            concerned, the moment it was made. I therefore recommend the passage of a joint
            resolution, in response to the Ohio joint resolution of February 21, 1871, respectfully
            denying the existence of any such compact as the one of the supposed breach of which she
            complains.</p>

            encourages me to call your attention to another matter of legislative practice, in which
            there is great need of improvement. I allude to the titles of many of the bills that are
            passed from time to time. The impression seems to prevail that because the Constitution
            has declared " that every act shall embrace but one subject and matters properly
            connected therewith, which subject shall be expressed in the title,"it therefore follows
            that the titles of bills must be longer than was necessary before such a provision
            existed. Such an impression is altogether incorrect. The principal subject, or one of
            the principal subjects of the act, should be briefly expressed in the title, and, this
            being done, every matter properly connected with the one so expressed, can be provided
            for without being alluded to in the title. Such phrases as the following are always
            unnecessary and, therefore, inelegant and improper in the titles of bills, viz: "And to
            declare an emergency," "and to repeal all laws inconsistent therewith," "and matters
            properly connected therewith," etc., etc. A very cursory examination of our legislation
            for years past, not excluding that of the late special session, will satisfy you how
            sadly our legislative literature is marred by the singularly grotesque, inelegant and
            almost interminable titles that are too often prefixed to bills. Not a few of these
            bills were signed by nie as approved, but I want it distinctly understood that I
            reserved the right to protest against Such titles. The title of one of them passed at
            the late special ses- <pb n="[15]" xml:id="VAA8558-14-607"/> sion, contains one hundred
            and sixty words, when a perfect title could have been framed in fifteen words. It is
            almost impossible to amend an act with such a title, so as to make the amendatory act
            and its title intelligible. I suggest the propriety of having a joint committee, whose
            duty it shall be to supervise the titles of bills, so that our statute books in the
            future may not be deformed by such titles as those to which allusion is made.</p>

          <head rend="center">INTEMPERANCE.</head>
          <p>The intelligent legislator can not close his eyes to the fact that the intemperate use
            of intoxicating liquors is fearfully prevalent, and that it is the fruitful source of
            pauperism and crime, of social disorder and domestic wretchedness. Nor can it be doubted
            that much the larger share of this intemperance is caused by the existence of the
            numerous places where public tippling is practiced and encouraged for pecuniary gain,
            under the auspices of the State. While it must be conceded that men can not be made
            virtuous by statutory enactments, it does not follow that schools of vice and nurseries
            of crime ought not to be restrained or suppressed to that extent to which public opinion
            will sustain and execute the laws made for that purpose. As Mr. Lincoln said of slavery,
            so say I of tippling houses, namely: If they are not wrong, then nothing is wrong. Every
            existing wrong can not, however, be overthrown in a day by a mere act of legislative
            authority, but it does not follow from this that nothing is to be done looking or
            tending toward such overthrow. The legislation of the State should on this subject keep
            pace with public opinion, and it would be better to have the law a little in advance of
            public opinion than to have it lag far behind. Good laws aid in the formation of a
            healthy public opinion, just as an enlightened public opinion aids in the formation and
            execution of good laws. I do not believe in the existence of the power or in the
            expediency of enacting sumptuary laws, but a law which restrains or suppresses one
            tippling house or all the tippling houses in the State, attempts to regulate no man's
            expenditures, nor does it prescribe what he shall eat or what he shall drink, or
            wherewithal he shall be clothed. In one set of public schools we educate the children
            and youth of the State, at the expense of the State, for the performance of the duties
            of American citizenship. In another set of public schools, over which mammon presides
            and in which the State is a partner, we authorize their proprietors to undo what the
            first have done or are doing, and to unfit every citizen who will yield to their
            influence for the performance of these same <pb n="[16]" xml:id="VAA8558-14-608"/>
            duties of American citizenship. No man who has any faith in human progress can believe
            that this state of affairs can or will always last. The enlightened statesman,
            remembering that in a republic public opinion is the foundation of the laws as well as
            the mainspring of their execution, will ask himself not only what is right, but what is
            practicable under existing circumstances, and will legislate for the right without
            defeating his own intentions by attempting the impracticable. You are fresh from the
            ranks of the people, assembled from all parts of the State, and are much better
            acquainted with public opinion than I am, and should, in my judgment, legislate for the
            restraint and diminution of public tippling houses to the highest point that the
            existing state of public opinion will sustain, so that (as Mr. Lincoln on another
            occasion said of slavery) the public mind may confidently rest in the belief that they
            are in process of ultimate extinction. In my opinion public drunkenness ought to be
            declared a misdemeanor by State law, and punished accordingly.</p>

          <head rend="center">PARDONS.</head>
          <p>I herewith respectfully submit pursuant to the requirements of the Constitution a
            report showing all reprieves, commutations and pardons granted, and another showing all
            fines and forfeitures remitted since the previous report made to the last General
            Assembly two years ago. After no inconsiderable thought and experience in relation to
            the exercise of the pardoning power, I am satisfied that the Governor ought to be
            authorized by law to issue revocable pardons, so that the person pardoned may be put
            upon his good behavior, and if he relapses into vicious ways, returned to the prison to
            serve out the residue of his sentence. Similar legislation should be adopted as to
            prisoners confined in the county jail for the non-payment of fines, to the end that they
            may be discharged from imprisonment conditionally, without a remission of their fines,
            and if they prove unworthy of the favor shown them, the discharge may be countermanded,
            and they may be returned to prison. Bills have been prepared and are now pending,
            intended to give effect to these views, and I feel confident that their passage would
            inaugurate not merely a change, but a reform.</p>
