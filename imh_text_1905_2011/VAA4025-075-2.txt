            Few aspects of Afro-American history have aroused such intense debate as the character of the black
                    family. For generations scholars have held that the most crippling effect of slavery was its
                    destruction of family life. They have argued that slavery emasculated the black male by depriving
                    him of his role as breadwinner and displacing family authority onto the white master; that it
                    subjected the black female to sexual and economic exploitation; and that it perpetuated, by the
                    threat of separation by sale, a sense of family impermanence. Slavery created an unstable family
                    life with the mother as the central figure and, after emancipation, placed the black family in a
                    disadvantageous position for competing with whites. Slavery, this traditional argument held, was the
                    major reason for the continuation of black poverty in the urban ghetto. And because of poverty, the
                    pattern of matriarchy continued to exist, since black males responded to menial work and job
                    insecurity by deserting their families. Thus in cities the low status of blacks was rooted in family
                        instability.1
            
            Most vividly expressed by E. 
                        Franklin
                     Frazier in the 1930s and Daniel P. Moynihan in the 1960s, this traditional view of

                     the black family has come under attack from several directions.
                    A number of scholars—notably Herbert Gutman—have identified considerably more
                    family stability than previously assumed. Family ties of affection, popularized by Alex Haley in Roots: The Saga of an American Family, provided a substantial resource with which
                    blacks resisted slavery on their own terms.2 Several scholars have investigated
                    the federal manuscript population schedules of 1870 and 1880 for information about newly emancipated
                    slaves. These studies have demonstrated the prevalence of two-parent, male-headed families among
                    urban as well as rural blacks. They suggest that the typical black household was not
                    "unorganized and disorganized" and that the urban experience, not the heritage of
                    slavery, was the basic determinant of late nineteenth-century black family life.3

                        proportion of two-parent families was consistently high: for example, Philidelphia, 76 percent; 
                            Cincinnati
                        , 79 percent; Mobile, 77 percent;

                        , 82 percent. Two-parent families in the rural areas cited in Gutman ranged from 82
                        to 86 percent and in urban areas from 69 to 74 percent. (Gutman, Black Family,

                            Illinois
                         town or city in his study and lacks a precise definition of family. Accordingly, he
                        uses the 1850, 1860, and 1870 manuscript censuses for family information, but since marital
                        status and relation of members of the household to the head of the household were not included
                        until the 1880 census, his conclusions about pre-1880 family life are questionable. The most
                        significant work is that of Gutman, who unfortunately devotes little of his study to the
                        post-Civil War period. Students of Indiana history, moreover, must cope with the absence of any
                        studies of the black family and the paucity of serious black history. The most useful work is

                        Historical Collections, Vol. XXXVII;

                        Vanderburgh
                     County in 1880 offers a valuable perspective on this issue. By studying the family life
                    of blacks with similar roots and socioeconomic conditions residing in the urban and rural sections
                    of the same county, one can show that not only was the two-parent, male-headed family the most
                    common form in both urban and rural areas, but also that black family structure was altered by the
                    urban experience. Black families responded to the urban setting by developing adaptive devices that
                    permitted the family to survive in its new environment.4
            
            As an 
                        Ohio
                     River county, 
                        Vanderburgh
                     had been an entry point for fugitive slaves prior to the Civil War. After the war, with
                    the rapid growth of 
                        Evansville
                     as a commercial and industrial center, the county attracted thousands of newcomers,
                    many of whom were black. In 1880 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County 
                  
                            
                        4 The most comprehensive picture of the county in 1870 and 1880 can
                                be found in U. S., Ninth Census, Population Schedules for 
                                    Vanderburgh
                                 County, Indiana. National Archives, Microfilm Publications No. M-593, Roll
                                364, pp. 89–515 A; and U. S., Tenth Census, Population Schedules for 
                                    Vanderburgh
                                 County, Indiana. National Archives, Microfilm Publications No. T9, Rolls
                                316–317, pp. 82–542. The chief source of this study, the 1880
                                manuscript census, has several weaknesses. It does not indicate whether the marriage had
                                been legalized, whether the male listed as the head of the household was the actual or
                                the titular head, and whether female heads of families listed as widows were in fact
                                widows or unwed mothers attempting to escape the stigma placed on persons in those
                                conditions. More important, the census measured life as it existed on the day the census
                                taker visited and thus provided little information about the fabric of black society.
                                For example, how durable were the two-parent households? Censuses also generally tended
                                to undercount young, poor, and black citizens. Nevertheless, the manuscript census is an
                                extremely valuable source of information about the black community, especially in 
                                    Vanderburgh
                                 County where there is no other source of significant data for that era.
                            For this study, the family will be defined in the terms used by record keepers of the
                                late nineteenth century—private and public families. A private family
                                included the household head and all persons related to him or her, as well as any
                                boarders or lodgers in the household. Public families included steamboat crews, boarding
                                house residents, and hotel staffs. Such families, as well as single-member households,
                                are excluded from this study. In 1880, there were fifty-seven such instances. The total
                                number of families studied, therefore, is slightly smaller than the number of households
                                in the 1880 census, although the two are nearly synonymous. Furthermore, this study does
                                not classify families listed as boarders and otherwise unrelated to the head of the
                                household as a separate household or include black families residing in white
                                households. (There were eight of the latter in the county.) It seeks rather to recreate
                                the family unit as it existed for blacks in 1880, seeing, for example, the addition of
                                an unrelated family or of a related family as a means of family adaptation. These
                                private families are classified according to the following types: nuclear (husband and
                                wife, or father, mother, and children); extended (a nuclear core and at least one
                                relative); and augmented (nuclear or extended and at least one boarder or lodger).
                                Finally, this study avoids the use of such words as patriarchal and matriarchal, since
                                the census offers little information on the quality of family life.
                        
               
                     boasted a population of 42,193, a 27 percent increase since
                    1870. 
                        Evansville
                    , the only urban area in the county, had 29,280 residents. Although the county had had
                    only 127 black residents in 1860, by 1880 it led Indiana counties in proportion of blacks and was
                    second only to 
                        Marion
                     County in the size of its black population, which numbered 3,819. Blacks in this
                    southwestern Indiana county were, moreover, predominantly urban, as 2,686 of the 3,819 lived in 
                        Evansville
                    .5
            
            Whether urban or rural, 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County blacks shared a common inheritance of illiteracy, propertylessness, and
                    powerlessness. Their way of life was dominated by low job status, poor living conditions,
                    residential segregation, and white hostility.6 In theory, they should have found
                    the achievement of stable family life nearly impossible.
            Rootlessness was among the major potential handicaps to the creation of stable black families. The
                    county's black population had increased from slightly over 100 in 1860 to 2,130 in 1870.
                    During the 1870s the population nearly doubled. Such rapid growth was largely due to migration from
                    former slave states, particularly 
                        Kentucky
                    . In 1870 two-thirds of

                     County blacks listed themselves as 
                        Kentucky
                    -born; in 1880, 2,017, or 53 percent, did. Three-quarters of the black population of
                    1880 had been born in states other than Indiana. Of them, 96 percent were natives of former slave
                    states. Of the Hoosier natives 80 percent were under age ten and the children of migrant parents.
                    Many newcomers, moreover, did not remain long in the county. Of the 465 heads of household in 1870,
                    for instance, only sixty-four were living in the county ten years later.7
            
            Another possible deterrent to stable family life was the position of the county's blacks at
                    the bottom of the social ladder. In 1870 half were illiterate, as compared with less than 5

                     percent of the white population. Ten years later, almost 40
                    percent were illiterate. Blacks were also desperately poor. In 1870 blacks owned less than 1 percent
                    of the total value of county real estate although they represented 6.4 percent of the population.
                    Only thirty blacks, slightly more than 1 percent of all blacks, owned real estate. A staggering
                    number, moreover, held the least desirable jobs. Of the 1,311 blacks listing a trade or occupation
                    in 
                        Evansville
                     in 1880, 511 were common laborers and 682 were in service, an indication of the
                    opportunities for employment in such jobs as waiter, driver, or domestic. Only fifty-seven blacks
                    were professionals, proprietors, or skilled workers. Half of these were either teachers or
                    ministers. Most of the 391 black workers living outside 
                        Evansville
                     were farm hands or unskilled workers. In all, 90 percent of the 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County blacks listing a trade or occupation were unskilled laborers or in service.8
            
            The rapidly growing black population was also the object of many forms of racial discrimination.
                    State law, for example, authorized the creation of "separate but equal" schools in
                    1869, and within a year two "colored schools" of doubtful quality had opened in 
                        Evansville
                    .9 Blacks were also subjected to residential segregation. In 1880 no
                    blacks lived in two of the county's eight townships and only a handful resided in a third.
                    Over one-third of the 1,133 rural blacks lived in Knight Township, where blacks accounted for about
                    24 percent of the total population. In rural Pigeon and Union townships, blacks represented,
                    respectively, slightly over 13 and 16 percent of the total population. In 
                        Evansville
                    , about 80 percent of the city's blacks resided in five enclaves with
                    predominantly black populations. Slightly over 44 percent lived in the largest enclave, an area
                    within a three-block radius of Eighth and Canal streets, near the old 
                        Wabash
                     and Erie Canal on the eastern boundary of the city.10
            
            Such physical separation of the races was largely due to the manner in which whites greeted black
                    newcomers. A race

                     riot in early August, 1865, resulted in the death of two blacks
                    and was an early signal of white hostility. Subsequently, such an attitude took several forms. One
                    Democratic editor declared, for instance, that "not one colored man out of a hundred is fit
                    to hold office. … [We] cannot hand the destinies of a community over to ignorant
                        rulers."11 In December, 1867, a poster in the predominantly German
                    west side warned blacks to leave that section by January 1, 1868, and a white who rented a home to a
                    black family received threats on his life.12 That such warnings were heeded was
                    shown by the absence of blacks in two rural townships and the extremely small percentage of blacks
                    in Wards 4 and 5—all areas with a high proportion of German Americans.13
            
            Despite such adversities, the two-parent, male-headed family prevailed among the Afro-Americans of 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County. That was apparent from the earliest moments of the postwar era. During and
                    immediately after the war, 
                        Kentucky
                     blacks—a largely illiterate, rural populace from diverse communities, fresh
                    from enslavement, and residents of a war-ravaged land—had demonstrated in many ways their
                    desire to begin living legally as families, even though their state did not allow them to do so
                    until coerced via the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in December, 1865. Such family and kin
                    sensibilities had their roots in African tradition and Afro-American adaptation, not merely in the
                    influence of slave owners or in the environment of freedom.14 The attachment of
                    former slaves to family was amply evident in the 1870 census of 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County, in which 91 percent of the heads of households indicated that they had been
                    born in slave states. Since the average ages of rural and urban household heads were, respectively,
                    40.8 and 35.6, the evidence strongly suggests that for most blacks marriage and family life had
                    antedated emancipation. Although the 1870 census did not denote marital status or family ties, it
                    underscored the importance of traditional family values, for 82 percent of the black households in
                    the county had a male head. There was, however, a pronounced difference between city and country
                    blacks, as males

                     headed 76.2 percent of urban households and 93.6 percent of
                    rural ones.15
            
            As shown in Table I, slightly over 83 percent of the black families in the county ten years later
                    contained a husband and a wife. In rural areas all but 2 percent did. In fact, in half of the rural
                    townships with blacks present, all families had a husband and a wife. In 
                        Evansville
                    , two-parent families accounted for about 78 percent of the total. The smallest
                    proportion of two-parent families existed in Ward 2, but even there the figure was about 70 percent.
                    In Ward 1, which had the highest percentage of black residents (17) in the city, two-parent families
                    accounted for three quarters of the total. Most of the one-parent families—123 of 126 in
                    the city and four of five in the country—were female-headed. Put another way, 657 of the
                    county's black families had male heads. Given the late nineteenth-century equation of
                    male-headed families with family stability, 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County black families appeared overwhelmingly stable.16
            
            The presence of a substantially larger proportion of female heads of families in 
                        Evansville
                     in 1880 than in rural 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County is thus not easily explained as a legacy of slavery or of the shock of
                    migration. Nor can it be described as a result of economic condition alone. Earlier observers
                    attributed female-headed families to the absence of occupational stability and dignity among
                    lower-class black men, who as a result of their condition deserted their families and
                    "shifted the responsibility of the maintenance of the household unit to the women.
                        …"17 The 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County census of 1880 does not support this traditional view of a largely jobless and
                    irresponsible black male population. As shown in Table II, all but twenty-five male heads of
                    families, or slightly over 96 percent, listed a trade or occupation. The percentage of urban males
                    claiming a job was, moreover, greater than that of rural males. Of those listing a job, a
                    substantial majority stated that they had not been out of work for any portion of the previous year.
            A corollary of the traditional view held that there were many men whose wives worked as domestics,
                    with the result that the husband lost his moral authority because his wife was

                     the provider of the family. Lacking authority, black men tended
                    to desert their families. This argument also is not supported by the evidence from 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County in 1880. Of the slightly more than four hundred black females listing a job in 
                        Evansville
                    , ninety were married, and of them, only eighteen, or one-fifth, had husbands who listed
                    no trade or occupation. That 80 percent of these families—about one in every seven black
                    families in the city—had two sources of income is an indication of adjustment to urban
                    conditions and strongly suggests that the traditional stereotype has limited utility. Moreover, few
                    married men lived separate from their spouses. Only twenty-four men—2 percent of the male
                    population aged twenty-one and above—fell into that category.18
            
            Economic status does, however, offer a clue to the structure of the black family. On the one hand, as
                    indicated in Table II, 356 male heads of families, or 79 percent of the total, were unskilled
                    laborers or service workers. Yet almost 96 percent of the employed black men in the city had such
                    employment. On the other hand, the proportion of professionals, proprietors, and skilled workers
                    heading families was slightly above 7 percent of the total of male-headed families, although the
                    percentage of all black males in these job classifications was slightly over 4 percent. The
                    likelihood of a man's heading a family appeared to decrease, in short, as job status
                        declined.19
            
            It is also likely that female-headed families found life much harsher than those headed by males. For
                    the sixty-five female heads who had employment—all but one in service—the
                    level of income must have been very low. Hence families which depended on a woman's wages
                    were usually poor.20 Among the fifty-eight other families with female heads, the
                    female had no employment, as noted in Table II, and the family depended for income upon a child, a
                    relative, or a boarder. As suggested by a recent study of 
                        Philadelphia
                     black families, moreover, the black woman with children in 
                        Evansville
                     probably faced enormous difficulties in remarrying, since suitably aged males suffered

                            who argues that social condition and family structure were unrelated. Because the 1880
                            census contained no data on property holding, occupation is the chief index of socioeconomic
                            status.

                             County. The table is based on Paul J. Lammermeier, "The Urban Black

                     higher mortality rates than females. In addition, because of
                    their age and the physically taxing nature of the work available, males were more likely to leave
                    town to find work, and women without means and with children to support had little bargaining power
                    over a potential mate.21
            
            The ratio of black males to black females in 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County appears, however, not to have affected family structure. As indicated in Table
                    III, there was a significant difference between the sex ratios in rural and urban portions of the
                    county. In the rural areas, the ratio was 175 males per 100 females, and in the age group in which
                    marriage was most likely, twenty-one to thirty, it was 193 to 100. This imbalance was due in large
                    part to the presence of 150 farm laborers aged fifteen to thirty. That these young men were probably
                    transient residents is suggested by the fact that the census was taken in June, a month in which
                    farm workers were in demand, and that most of the 150 men were single and residents of white
                    households. Such a condition might have been expected to encourage promiscuity, but there were
                    virtually no indications—desertion, divorce, or single parenthood—of such
                    occurrences. In the city, males and females were distributed equally in nearly every age bracket,
                    and thus there existed a potentially more favorable climate for stable family life. Two-parent
                    families represented, nonetheless, a far smaller proportion of all black families in the city as
                    compared with the country.22
            
            The ages of the heads of families also provide little assistance in explaining the higher incidence
                    of female heads in 
                        Evansville
                     than rural 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County. Although black men did not live as long as black women,23
                    age alone does not explain the urban-rural difference. As shown in Table IV, the majority of female
                    heads of urban families were not aged forty and above, where widowhood was seemingly most likely to

                        Pittsburgh and Cincinnati
                      (109.2 to 100 and 110.6 to 100, respectively), and
                            substantially lower than that of

                     occur. About the same proportion of male and female heads of
                    families, in fact, were aged twenty-one to forty—301 male heads, or 67 percent, and
                    eighty-three female heads, or 68 percent. In the post-forty age bracket, there was a similar
                    pattern, with 146 male heads, or slightly above 32 percent, and thirty-nine female heads, or nearly
                    32 percent. The fact that most female heads were in their twenties and thirties—unlike
                    black females in several other 
                        Ohio
                     River cities in that year—suggests that age alone does not account for the
                    larger percentage of female heads in 
                        Evansville
                     than in its rural environs.24
            
            Slavery, economic condition, sex ratio, and age, therefore, provide inadequate explanations for the
                    urban-rural differences in family structure. A more fruitful area of inquiry is the nature of the
                    urban experience itself. Rural and urban birthplace, when considered in conjunction with literacy,
                    suggests "compelling reason to question the destructive impact which slavery allegedly had
                    on the black family." Examination of birthplace and literacy in 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County provides evidence consistent with recent studies which suggest that former
                    slaves were more likely than northern-born blacks to have two-parent households. Although it is
                    impossible to state un-equivocably that northern-born blacks had urban and southern-born blacks had
                    slave and rural roots, "place of birth provides a plausible proxy for ex-slave status,
                    especially when considered in conjunction with illiteracy."25 As
                    indicated by Table V, 
                        Evansville
                    's southern-born blacks, literate as well as illiterate, surpassed their
                    northern-born counterparts in the percentage of two-parent families. Combined with the virtual
                    absence of one-parent families in the rural parts of the county, this strongly suggests that city
                    residence contributed to the breakdown of the two-parent family.26
            
            One important aspect of the urban experience in this respect may have been the availability of work
                    for females in various service positions. All but one of the sixty-five employed

                             Valley cities cited in Lammermeier's study, 62 percent of all male
                            heads were aged twenty-one to forty, and 59 percent of all female heads were either below
                            twenty-one or over forty. In

                             black families cited in Furstenburg, Hershberg, and Modell,
                            "Female-Headed Black Family," 221.
               
                     female heads of families worked as washwomen, cooks, domestics,
                    and chambermaids. An example was Rebekah Posey, a forty-seven-year-old widow who lived at 119
                    Chestnut Street and worked as a chambermaid on a steamboat. Her twenty-seven-year-old daughter
                    Maggie, who was single, also provided some income by working as a seamstress. The lack of such work
                    in rural areas may have attracted husbandless women with families to the city, thus lowering the
                    proportion of families with one parent in rural areas and raising it in the city.27
            
            This explanation needs some qualification, for about half of the females who headed families in 
                        Evansville
                     were unemployed. All but ten of these women, however, had someone—a child, a
                    relative, or a boarder—to provide family income. Such was the case of the widowed Mary
                    Bailey of 223 Chestnut Street, whose family included a sixteen-year-old daughter, a sixty-year-old
                    mother, and two sons in their twenties, both of whom had jobs.28
            
            A second aspect of city life contributing to the higher incidence of female heads in the city was the
                    social stress which accompanied the urbanization of newcomers. Of the 123 urban female heads, as
                    indicated in Table VI, thirty-four were single, married living without spouses, or divorced. That
                    was undoubtedly due in half of the cases to desertion or separation by husbands, either because the
                    husband left the family to seek employment elsewhere or because he lacked loyalty to his spouse. It
                    is interesting to note, moreover, that half of the married women living without spouses, half of the
                    unwed mothers, and one quarter of the divorced women resided in Ward 2, an area which may have
                    attracted these women because of its hotels, restaurants, steamboats, and affluent whites. The ward
                    also contained a third of the city's black boarders and a third of the single black males
                    over age eighteen. As such, the presence of single female parents in this ward may have reflected
                    the disintegration of social controls associated with rural society in what was probably the most
                    transient area of the city.29

                         County. The table is based on Frank Furstenburg, Jr., Theodore Hershberg, and John
                        Modell, "The Origins of the Female-Headed Black Family: The Impact of the Urban
                        Experience," Journal of Interdisciplinary History, VI (August, 1975),
                        221, Table 4.
            
            
            Since the number of female heads of families who were single, married but living without their
                    spouses, or divorced accounted for slightly more than one-quarter of the total, however, a much more
                    persuasive explanation of female-headed families was widowhood. As revealed in Table VI, eight-nine,
                    or about 72 percent, of the female heads were widows. In the nineteenth century, mortality was
                    "the major link between female-headship and the poverty cycle. …" The
                    most ravaged among the poor were "the urban poor blacks, irregularly employed, segregated,
                    and neglected in matters of public health."30 The ferocity of mortality
                    among Indiana blacks was evident in many ways. In its report for 1882–1883, the Indiana
                    Board of Health disclosed that the death rate for Hoosier blacks was more than twice that of native
                    whites—16.5 per 1,000 population as compared with 7.3 per 1,000 population. In 
                        Evansville
                    , of the 507 coroners' inquests between 1888 and 1894, 153 cases, or slightly
                    over 30 percent, involved blacks, even though blacks accounted for less than a tenth of the total
                    population. In 1880, 23 percent of the persons buried in the city's largest public
                    cemetery, Oak Hill, were black. Death was, moreover, as commonplace among persons in their twenties
                    and thirties as it was among children and the elderly. In 1876, for example, of the sixty-eight
                    blacks buried at Oak Hill, twenty-six were aged two or less, seven were sixty or older, and
                    twenty-six were between twenty and forty years of age. Similarly, of the 153 blacks entered in the
                    coroners' inquests of 1888–1894, two of every five were between eighteen and
                    forty. It is also striking that sixteen of the twenty-six young adults buried in 1876 were males,
                    and that the coroners' inquests of 1888–1894 and 1898–1902 revealed a
                    similar pattern.31
            
            The possibility that a husband might die at any moment was an omnipresent fact of family life for
                    urban blacks. As indicated by Table IV, the number of widows in 
                        Evansville
                     in their twenties and thirties was more than twice the number of those who were older
                    than forty. The likelihood of widowhood 
                  major source of black prostitution. See

                increased, however, with age. As noted in Table IV, among 
                        Evansville
                     women in their twenties, only about 13 percent were heads of families but that
                    proportion nearly doubled for women in their forties and tripled for women in their sixties.32
            
            City life, in short, appeared to alter somewhat the structure of the black family. The number of
                    female-headed families reflected the harshness of urban living conditions for blacks, including
                    their inability to compete on an equal basis with whites and the disintegration of the communal ties
                    associated with rural society.33 Female-headed families also indicated that
                    urban life provided opportunities for employment of women which country life did not. Although it is
                    ultimately impossible to determine the exact relationship between city life and female-headed
                    families—i.e., how many married women were widowed, divorced, or deserted after arriving
                    in 
                        Evansville
                    , and how many female parents moved to the city because of job
                    opportunities—it is clear that a close relationship existed and that the female-headed
                    family adapted to urban conditions. In seventy-one families headed by a woman, the household
                    included a relative or boarder, or both, as means of providing financial support and/or child care.
                    In two-thirds of the instances in which the female had a job, women worked as washwomen, a job which
                    although menial allowed mothers the 
                  
                     32 Furstenberg, Hershberg, and Modell, "Female-Headed Black
                            Family," 226–29, indicates that 74.3 percent of black female heads in 
                                Philadelphia
                             were widows. Since the rate of mortality increased sharply with age and the age
                            of the 
                                Evansville
                             black population, like that of 
                                Philadelphia
                            , was neither older nor younger than that of the native white population, the
                            devastation of the high mortality rate is clear. As the age of the head of the family
                            increased, the likelihood of a widow heading the family did also.

                     opportunity to care for their children while also providing a
                    small family income. It is also interesting to note that 60 percent of the widows lived in three of
                    the city's sixteen census districts, within walking distance of the city's hotels,
                    restaurants, steamboat landings, and homes of affluent whites, where a variety of opportunities for
                    domestic and personal service existed for black women as well as black men.34
            
            That three-quarters of the urban female heads were widows and not unwed mothers, divorced, or married
                    living without their spouses is one of many evidences of the importance of traditional family values
                    among blacks in 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County. The two-parent, male-headed family appears to have been deeply rooted in the
                    culture of the migrant black and not an acquisition of life after emancipation. In spite of the
                    harsh effects of city life, which was probably the chief reason for the increase in the number of
                    female-headed families, an overwhelming number of urban black families contained a husband and a
                        wife.35
            
            Given that town life led to a greater proportion of female heads, it is also clear that the urban
                    family was required to adapt to different conditions by developing several distinctive forms. One of
                    the most important adaptations was taking in boarders. As shown in Table VII, in rural sections the
                    predominant family type was nuclear, the social unit which until recently most scholars had
                    considered an urban-industrial phenomenon. Of the 155 nuclear families, 123 included a father, a
                    mother, and at least one child. Of the rest, all but three were incipient—those in which
                    a husband and a wife had no children. All told, nuclear families accounted for about three-quarters

                            Ibid. Although the focus of this article is upon the urban-rural forms of
                            the black family, it is interesting to note that white families were not significantly
                            different in structure. In the census district with the highest percentage of native-born
                            whites, 83.9 percent of white families and 74.6 percent of black families were male-headed.
                            In the district with the highest percentage of foreign-born whites, the proportions were,
                            respectively, 86.6 and 83.0. In the district with the highest proportion of blacks, of the
                            134 black families, 59.0 percent were nuclear, 22.4 percent were extended, and 18.7 were
                            augmented. Of the 351 white families in that district, the corresponding percentages were
                            64.1, 17.4, and 18.5. On the whole, the chief difference between black and white families
                            appears to have been the occupational status of the family head, not the structure or
                            composition of the family. Few historians have attempted to compare systematically black and
                            white families. An exception is Harris, "Black 
                                Atlanta
                            ," but Gutman, in The Black Family,
                            303–326, states that such an endeavor is irrelevant, given the uniqueness of the
                            Afro-American experience.
               
                     of all rural black families. The extended family, often
                    presumed to be typical of rural society, represented only 12.4 percent of the total.36
            
            Within the city, by contrast, families organized according to the nuclear type accounted for only
                    slightly more than half of the total, and less than half of the nuclear families—143 of
                    293—included father, mother, and children. About 30 percent of the nuclear families were
                    incipient, and approximately 20 percent were attenuated—those with one parent. Variations
                    of the extended family totalled slightly over 16 percent. The most significant difference among
                    urban families was the presence, in about one-third of them, of some form of family
                    augmentation—i.e., the addition of boarders and/or lodgers. Put another way, about the
                    same proportion of 
                        Evansville
                     families included relatives and/or boarders and lodgers as those which did not.37
            
            Thus the typical rural family resembled that of James Wagner, who with his wife Henrietta had
                    recently moved from their native 
                        Kentucky
                    , since their youngest child, Viola, had been born in the Bluegrass state in 1878. A
                    farmer who perhaps rented his small amount of acreage, Wagner received help from his son, James,
                    Jr., who was listed as a farm laborer. The four middle children had attended school during the
                    previous year. Given the age of their eldest child, it is likely that James and Henrietta had been
                    married in the early 1860s at about the ages of twenty-five and twenty, respectively.38
            
            In 
                        Evansville
                     the variety of family types was unmistakable. Many were similar to the family of
                    Gilbert Johnson, a thirty-three-year-old moulder, who lived with his wife Mary, aged thirty-two, and
                    their five children at 107 Douglass Street, in the center of the city's largest black
                    enclave. The Johnsons had probably been married in 
                        Arkansas
                     in 1866, and their 
                  
                     36 The categories of family composition are based on Lammermeier,
                            "Urban Black Family," 453, Table 9.

                            relative was present. The percentages of nuclear families in other cities were generally

                eldest son had been born there in 1867. Soon after that, the three of them had migrated to
                    Indiana, where the second child, Mary, had been born in 1869. To provide additional income,
                    Gilbert's wife took in washing. Other urban families approximated that of Thomas Rogers, a

                    in 
                        Kentucky
                     and, like the rural Wagners, had reached 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County during the previous two years. Still other families were like that of 
                        Henry Washington
                    , who resided at 1223 West 
                        Virginia
                     Street. Henry, a thirty-six-year-old laborer, and his wife, Annie, twenty-five, were
                    illiterate. They had four children aged six to one, all of whom had been born in Indiana. Also
                    residing in the household was a laborer, Wesley Gardner, a native of 
                        Tennessee
                    . 
                        Henry Washington
                     must have been previously married, since he had another son, Squire, aged fifteen, whom
                    the census taker listed as having run away from home.39
            
            Reasons for these urban-rural differences in family composition are probably more easily explained
                    than the differences in family authority. The economic condition of urban blacks seems especially
                    important. In general, as shown by Table VIII, the proportion of nuclear families increased with the
                    occupational status of the head of the family. Conversely, the proportion of families with boarders
                    increased as the occupational status of the family head declined, an indication of the need for
                    additional income. The addition of relatives to urban families 
                  
                            39
                            Ibid.
                        
               
                     appears unrelated to job status. In rural areas, despite
                    occupation, the nuclear family was preponderant. Because of the extremely small number of rural
                    families in three of the five occupational categories, however, comparison is limited to
                    semi-skilled workers, mostly small farmers, and common laborers. Families of laborers were more
                    likely than those of semiskilled workers to be nuclear in form and less likely to include relatives.
                    The proportion of augmented families was nearly equal. The significant increase in family
                    augmentation and the decline of the nuclear family among urban lower class blacks, as compared with
                    the high incidence of nuclear families and the low incidence of augmented families among rural lower
                    class blacks, suggests that urban conditions, not the status of work, profoundly affected family
                    composition.
            Birthplace and sex of the head of the family appeared to have little effect upon family composition.
                    As noted in Table IX, among urban families there was little difference in the proportion of
                    augmented families with Indiana, other northern, 
                        Kentucky
                    , or other southern roots. The chief difference seems to be the substantially higher
                    distribution of nuclear families in which the head was Indiana-born. Similarly, Indiana-born heads
                    of families seemed unlikely to add relatives. Perhaps Hoosier-born families were slightly poorer
                    than their southern-born counterparts, since relatives did not necessarily provide additional family
                    income and were a financial drain on family resources. Among rural families, the low number of
                    families with freeborn heads made comparison difficult. Among families with southern-born heads,
                    there was a much more substantial proportion of nuclear families and a much lower number of
                    augmented families than among their urban counterparts. Families of likely former slaves were
                    overwhelmingly nuclear in the country, but in the city they were evenly divided among nuclear and
                    extended or augmented types. As shown in Table X, moreover, the sex of the head of the family made
                    little difference. In 
                        Evansville
                    , male and female-headed families were nearly alike in distribution by type. In
                    comparison with male-headed urban families, male-headed rural families were more likely to be
                    nuclear and less likely to be augmented. Since there were only four female-headed families in the
                    country, comparison of male and female-headed rural families is impossible.40
            
            
               
                  40 The percentage of male-headed nuclear and extended/augmented families
                        was about the same as in 
                     Louisville and
                                Cincinnati

            These comparisons suggest that city life was the chief reason for changes in the family composition
                    of 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County blacks. In response to the harshness of the urban climate, families found means
                    of adjusting and therefore of surviving. Although nineteenth-century observers identified boarding
                    with the lower class, and therefore poverty, squalor, and family disruption, they failed to discern
                    that family extension and augmentation were ways of preserving the family. For blacks to have
                    attempted to perpetuate the nuclear, isolated family in the city would have been self-destructive.
                    The inclusion of boarders provided families income and perhaps benefitted the boarder by giving
                    shelter, in a family environment, from urban stress. The addition of relatives could provide not
                    only additional family income but also such services as child care when both parents worked. It also
                    allowed for the perpetuation of a kin network in the urban setting, thus maintaining family ties and
                    affording shelter for relatives, many of whom were young. In 
                        Evansville
                    , the typical extended family was not three-generational but two-generational, including
                    a brother, sister, nephew, or niece of the head of the family or his spouse. As shown in Table VIII,
                    family extension was nearly as common among low status urban blacks as it was among the more
                    affluent. The addition of relatives, on the whole, was not a function of status—i.e., a
                    luxury which only some blacks could afford.
            
            Such differences in family composition notwithstanding, an overwhelming majority of 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County black families had at their core a husband, a wife, and at least one child.
                    Whether nuclear, extended, or augmented, in rural areas the core of 204 of 210 families was either
                    incipient or simple; in the city it was 448 of 574.
            A related effect of city life—the tendency for several unrelated families to live in the
                    same dwelling because of rental costs—was also evident. In 1880, although there were as
                    many families as there were dwellings in rural 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County, in 
                        Evansville
                     the ratio was 1.2 families for each dwelling. More than one family resided in about 7
                    percent of rural dwellings, but in the city the percentage was 14.2. In most of these cases there
                    were two families per dwelling, but in thirteen cases there were three or more families per
                    dwelling. Rural families were, however, slightly larger than urban families—4.7 persons
                    per family as compared with 4.3, a likely reflection of the larger number of one-parent families in
                    the city.41
            
            Another means by which the black family adapted to the city was through the employment of married
                    women. In this era, in which women were supposed to remain at home and avoid the vagaries of office
                    and factory, the importance of female employment among 
                        Evansville
                     blacks was clear. Of the approximately 1,700 blacks employed in the county in June,
                    1880, 430, or slightly more than 25 percent, were women, and all but eighteen of them lived in the
                    city. In rural areas, moreover, only five black wives worked, but in the city working wives
                    accounted for almost 23 percent of all employed black women, and for one-sixth of the married black
                    women. Such a pattern reflected the inferior economic position of the black

                                Evansville
                            , half of the families with relatives included a brother, sister,
                            brother-in-law, or sister-in-law of the head of the family. The mother or father of the
                            family head was present in about one-quarter of the cases. Although augmentation seemed to
                            be a result of economic need, family extensions was not, as Pleck avers ("The
                            Two-Parent Household," in Gordon, The American Family,
                            168–69), limited to those who could afford to take in relatives. See also U. S.,

                                Louisville
                            , for instance, there were 4.1 persons per family. Lammermeier, "Urban

                     family and the development of a means whereby the family
                    attempted to survive the challenge of the city.42
            
            The urban black family also showed its adaptability in the frequency with which teenage children
                    worked away from the family. Although an overwhelming proportion of 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County blacks resided in families—85 percent in rural areas and 91 percent
                    in the city—the typical black family in the city did not shelter children from the world
                    until legal age by either sending them to school or by keeping them out of the work force according
                    to the middle-class model.43 As disclosed by Table XI, of the forty-eight males
                    and forty-four females aged thirteen to twenty-one living at home in rural areas, twelve males and
                    only three females had a job. By contrast, thirty-six males and forty-one females either had no job
                    or had attended school the previous year. An additional seventy-five males and thirty-two females
                    did not live at home. That is, about 61 percent of the males and 42 percent of the females between
                    ages thirteen and twenty-one did not live with their families. If one adds the percentage of young
                    persons employed but living at home, about 67 percent of rural males and 47 percent of rural females
                    did not fit the late nineteenth-century model of the family as a shelter for its young members. In
                    the city of 
                        Evansville
                    , the proportion of children in these categories was even greater—71.2
                    percent of males and 56.5 percent of females.44
            
            In addition to the probability that black schooling was inferior and that the poverty of black
                    families forced members to find work as soon as possible, it is likely that young, rural women were
                    more prone than young rural males to remain at home, and that when they left home, their purpose was
                    marriage.

                            children living with no parents was, in order, 7.9, 3.5, 6.5, and 3.7. In

                             65 percent of the children aged fifteen or less lived with both parents, but in

                             County 87 percent did. See U. S., Tenth Census, population schedules for 
                                Vanderburgh
                             County, 1880; and Lammermeier, "Urban Black Family," 451,
                            Table 6. In 1880 the percentage of black school-age children attending school was 45.6 in
                            the city of 
                                Evansville
                             and 35.3 in the country. School age in that era was defined as ages five to
                            twenty-one. Ibid.
                  
               
                     If at home, rural males were far more likely to have a job than
                    rural females. They were also much less likely to marry, as seventy-one of the seventy-five males
                    living outside families were single. That females who wished to work moved to the city is suggested
                    by the substantial increase in the proportion of single females in the city who lived away from home
                    and had a job, as well as by the greater proportion of females than males in 
                        Evansville
                    . There was also a substantial increase in the percentage of females who lived at home
                    and had a job, undoubtedly in domestic service. Another important urban-rural difference was the
                    near reversal of the proportion of males living at home and away from home, perhaps a reflection of
                    the availability of agricultural work when the census was taken. Like rural males, however, few
                    urban males in this age group either attended school or were married, and a larger
                    proportion—seventy-four of 197 in the city, as compared with twelve of 122 in the
                    country—had a trade or occupation. Urbanization, therefore, appeared to have altered the
                    life styles of females aged thirteen to twenty-one and to increase the percentage of working males
                    in that age bracket.45
            
            The data provided in Table XI also offer a clue to the process by which blacks established families.
                    Here, too, there were evidences of the impact of urban life. In the thirteen to twenty-one age
                    bracket, twenty-four of seventy-six rural females and forty-three of 253 urban females, most of whom
                    were aged nineteen to twenty-one, were married, but only four of 123 rural and three of 197 urban
                    males were. That implied that although males and females began to leave home by their late teens,
                    females were much more likely to marry at that age than were males. This pattern was applicable to
                    rural as well as urban males and was also borne out by the presence of 165 single persons in the
                    country and 498 in the city aged eighteen or more, of whom 144 and 319, respectively, were men. It
                    also appears that when rural black females left home, they were more likely than their urban
                    counterparts to become married, if they remained in the country. Although one in three rural females
                    in this age bracket was married, only one in six urban females was.46
            
            Given the data provided in Tables IV, XI, and XII, moreover, one can infer that the typical

                     wife was younger, on the average, by five years. Among rural
                    families the male tended to be slightly older than his urban counterpart when marrying. Urban
                    females also tended to be closer in age to their mates. Furthermore, a study of two representative
                    sections—rural Pigeon Township and urban census district 77, which had the highest
                    percentage of black residents in the city—discloses that the average male head of family
                    in the rural area was 40.9 years and the age of his eldest child was 11.2, thus intimating that the
                    first child was born when the father was nearly thirty. In the city, the average male head was 38.1
                    years old and his eldest child 12.1, suggesting that initial fatherhood occurred at age twenty-six.
                    This also indicates that the typical head of the family in the county had been born in slavery in
                    the early 1840s and had begun his family shortly after the end of the Civil War. When and where
                    these families were formed can be determined in part by examining families with either at least two
                    children, the older born elsewhere and the younger born in Indiana, or with all children born
                    elsewhere. From these indicators one can infer that about 40 percent of the 210 rural and about 30
                    percent of the urban families had been created in a former slave state during the 1860s and had
                    migrated as a unit to 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County between 1865 and 1880. That many families had southern roots and had migrated as
                    units was also evidenced by the ages of the persons listed in the census as Indiana-born. About 72
                    percent of the 360 rural and 63 percent of the 690 urban blacks who were native Hoosiers were aged
                    ten or less.47
            
            A substantial number of families, moreover, were in early stages of formation. As noted in Table XII,
                    about one-third of the heads of rural and urban families were aged twenty-one to thirty. An
                    additional third were in their thirties. All told, about 85 percent of urban and rural family heads
                    were aged fifty or less. That urban families were comparatively younger is indicated not only by the
                    slightly lower age of the average urban family head but also by the fact that a larger number of
                    urban families were incipient or childless—30 percent in the city as compared with 18.6
                    percent in the country. These families without children were usually headed by younger persons, for
                    about two in five rural heads of incipient families and three in five urban heads of incipient
                    families were aged thirty or less. 
                  
                     47
                            Ibid. When a family was childless or when all of the children were born in
                            Indiana it was impossible to determine when or where the family had been formed.

                             County. Unlike previous tables, which are based on the entire black population
                            in the county, this one is based on representative rural and urban samples— rural
                            Pigeon and Scott townships and urban census districts 77 and 78 (Ward 1).
               Less than a third of urban and rural heads of incipient families were aged forty or more, a
                    hint that most incipient families were not headed by parents whose children had left home. Combined
                    with the larger proportion of rural families who had migrated as a unit to the county and the lower
                    average age of urban heads, the data suggest that not only were younger families more likely to
                    migrate northward, but also that a larger proportion of urban families were just getting started.
                    Perhaps that was due to the availability of work in the city of 
                        Evansville
                    . Such features appear to be characteristic of other 
                        Ohio
                     Valley cities. In 
                        Cincinnati
                    , for instance, the proportion of incipient families was 27.6 percent.48

                        the four smaller river cities were, in order, 24.1, 24.7, and 14.8.
            
            
            Despite a variety of evidences of family stress in the city and of ensuing urban-rural differences in
                    family structure, the federal census of 1880 offers considerable support for the integrity and
                    strength of the family among the thousands of Afro-Americans who migrated to 
                        Vanderburgh
                     County soon after the Civil War. The couple-headed family was the core of black
                    society. Couples headed almost 98 percent of rural and 78 percent of urban families. Most blacks
                    lived in families, and most children lived with both parents. In family composition, about
                    three-fourths of rural and one-half of urban families were nuclear. Instances of divorce, desertion,
                    and other signs of marital stress were few. At the same time, however, there were important
                    differences between urban and rural families. Urban families had more one-parent heads, were more
                    likely to be extended or augmented, were slightly smaller in size but more likely to share a
                    dwelling with another family, slightly younger in the age of the head of the family, less likely to
                    have children, and more prone to break up due to death, divorce, and desertion. Adolescents in urban
                    families were less likely to attend school or to live with parents without having a job. The causes
                    of these differences cannot be attributed to slavery or the migration process, as blacks in the
                    county generally shared the same geographic roots and socioeconomic condition. The origins of these
                    differences lay instead in the urban experience, characterized by occupational instability,
                    residential segregation, disease, institutional racism, and social disintegration. The vitality of
                    the black family was nonetheless apparent in many ways, not only in the persistence of the
                    two-parent, nuclear family, but also in the various means by which the family adapted to the urban
                        setting.49

                    an ability to meet the challenges of a new environment.

            The activities of the first day of 1881 varied little from other days for William Gregory Harrison, a
                    young farmer from Jefferson Township, 
                        Morgan County
                    , Indiana. He spent most of New Years Day in nearby Martinsville with his father,
                    brought several purchases home for his brother Alvin, chopped some firewood, and noted the
                    day's one distingushing event: "This day mother passed the fiftieth milestone on
                    her life's journey."1 William Gregory was twenty-six years old
                    at the time he penned the above comment, and he still resided on his father's, Frederick
                    Augustus Harrison's, farm. The journal that the young man kept during 1880 and 1881
                    presents a detailed look at mid-nineteenth-century farm life. He was a bright, perceptive observer,
                    and his journal thus remains an important documentary source for daily life in rural Indiana.2

                    and his two brothers, Charles 
                        Ripley
                     and Alvin Daniel, had all died at the age of twenty-seven at approximately two year
                    intervals. It, however, had proved impossible to locate causes of death for each of the young men.

                        Indianapolis
                    , subsequently found the cause of death for Charles 
                        Ripley
                     Harrison in the mortality schedules of the 1880 manuscript census for 
                        Morgan County
                    . Charles died of consumption contracted in 
                        Terre Haute
                    .3
            
            Additional information about Charles 
                        Ripley
                     in the mortality schedules also proved enlightening. Based upon the birth places and
                    dates of the two youngest Harrison children—both of whom had died in
                    childhood—it had been presumed that the Frederick A. Harrisons had moved to 
                        Morgan County
                     sometime between 1857 and 1863. The notation in the mortality schedules that Charles
                    had resided in the county for nineteen years indicated that the move from 
                        Ohio
                     to Indiana probably took place in 1860. Also, Charles

            Several journal entries consisted of coded statements, and several readers proved curious and adroit
                    enough to decode the sentences. They did not, as originally thought, contain comments on church
                    sermons, but referred, instead, to girls. The lines supported the original contention that
                    "while William Gregory obviously enjoyed the company of young ladies, if one were special
                    to him, he makes no mention of her."5 The corrected coded and decoded
                    lines are as follows:

            Alma Fraker, a Martinsville resident, provided through her own research an additional clarification
                    about the schools in Jefferson Township. School Number 7, the Buffalo schoolhouse, and
                    Loper's schoolhouse, as suggested in Part I, all refer to the same school. It was located
                    off the Buffalo Road on the property of W. L. Loper in Sections 34 and 35 of Jefferson Township.7
            
            The last entry in the surviving portion of the "Chronicles of Upper Burnet" is as
                    undramatic as those that went before it. Tuesday, May 24, 1881, was a hot, unsettled day devoted to
                    mundane farm chores—plowing and harrowing the fields and washing clothes. Yet, as often
                    occurred on the Frederick Harrison farm, visitors enlivened the family's day.8 William Gregory Harrison, as usual, recorded no dramatic event of national significance.
                    Nonetheless, the everyday details of Indiana farm life hold an intrinsic interest for late
                    twentieth-century readers.

                        The thermometer indicated 7 degrees below zero this morning, but stood at an average
                                    of 25 above till night. The day was almost undisturbed by clouds and a little
                                    thawing was done in favorable places. Father and I passed the most of the day in
                                    town, going in the hack. I took Aunt Mary's2 butter to
                                    her as I generally do and received from her a present for Alvin of a copy of that
                                    highly non-partisan book "A Fool's Errand." I also bought
                                    him a knit coat or "wammus"3 at the store but
                                    of course did'n't pay for it. We were home before four
                                    o'clock and madesome firewood after we came. Alvin
                                    did'n't squiz4 much if any to-day. This day

                        A rather disappointing Sunday to me. About eleven o'clock I started over

                                            "Upper Burnet" refers to Burnett's Creek, a
                                            tributary of the White River, which ran through the
                                            Harrison's farm. Today the creek is known as Lamb's Creek,
                                            taking its name from Lamb's Bottom, a small, fertile valley in

                                            uncertain. Internal evidence suggests that it may refer to some kind of wood
                                            working. See especially the journal entry for January 19, 1881. Lloyd

                                            and that the "squiz-shop" was a cider press. Interview

                                            Lamb's Creek Church located on Burnett's Creek off the
                                            Bellinger Road. The Church of Christ still has a church on the site,
                                            although the current building does not date from the period of the

                                    travelling the same road and at the same time met Jap Foster7
                                    coming here to get something in the nature of ointment for his dad who had gouged
                                    his knee with a cross-cut saw tooth making a wound slight in appearance but very
                                    nearly laying him up. Father sent him some arnica and—axle-grease, and
                                    Alvin went back with Jap but only staid till one o'clock. Mr. Kirk and I
                                    went into the old church, built up a fire and discussed various topics till nearly
                                    one o'clock when we separated he going home, I to Bob's.8 I ate a bite there and at two o'clock took the church
                                    keys and started alone for 
                                        Bethlehem
                                    ,9 got there before the greater part of the
                                    congregation did and opened the house and started or helped start the fires. When
                                    Mr. Moore10 arrived it was three o'clock He soon began
                                    and preached a good sermon in more senses than one from Psalms 51, 12 and 13 He had
                                    to do most of the singing himself.
                        It was a bright warm sunshiny day. The mercury stood at zero at sunrise and there was
                                    neither freezing, nor thawing, and but few clouds.
                        Monday January 3rd.
                        The day was about as yesterday rather cloudier and a little warmer. We made a good
                                    deal of preparation, rigging up a swinging-pole to scald and hang with, and killed
                                    two of our hogs. We swung our pole to the elm tree this side of the shop. We got
                                    done before one o'clock Father had the horses hitched to the bob sled and
                                    went gallopading up to the old church at 
                                        Bethlehem
                                    , where he got four of the long logs of the building. He had a little
                                    trouble with them but got home before three

                                            in section 22, Jefferson Township, was replaced by the Methodist Episcopal

                                     o'clock. John Kivett11 came home with him bringing home the sausagemill apparently as sound as

                        Tuesday January 4th.
                        The usual lard-rendering, meat-cutting sausage-grinding etc. went on to-day. Father
                                    and Alvin did a good deal more than I did. The presumption is that they knew how
                                    better. I made two efforts to discover a couple of strange hogs seen on the premises
                                    yesterday. The second effort I succeeded in finding one of them but
                                    did'n't get him out. Bill Hand12 came about 3
                                    o'clock and carried off the heads heels and backs or rather feet and
                                    backbones of the two hogs killed yesterday. It snowed from the time we got up till
                                    nearly three o clock when it partially cleared. The snow was perhaps a half inch
                                    deeper on the ground
                        Wednesday January 5th.
                        A damp dark fog settled down and made the landscape dismal in appearance. It froze on
                                    the trees. Snow began spitting down about noon but soon quit, only to begin and pelt
                                    down in great flakes coming faster than at any time before this season. It kept at
                                    it till after dark. Immediately after breakfast I started out with ax and dog to
                                    hunt hogs I patrolled all the ground on the place where I thought strange hogs could
                                    be, without finding any, then went to where the road fence crosses or connects with
                                    the big creek, cut ice, and fenced with willow poles, till I thought I had an
                                    effectual barricade. Father in the meantime had gone with the bob sled to the old
                                    church after logs. He lost part of his load on the other side of the Fowler hill. He
                                    came home with part and went back after the lost ones. By that time I had cut down a
                                    sycamore tree close to the road in John Fowler's13
                                    wheat-field and he hauled two drags of it to the house for back-logs. Alvin worked
                                    at reconstructing or repairing the old sled most of the time. Father went up to Bob
                                    Foster's a visiting after dark. Neither very cold nor very warm
                        Thursday, January 6th.
                        Not much space will be required to chronicle this day's events. Mother and

                                     also. Father went down to the creek; discovered
                                    that my barrier of willows had been too feeble and coming to the house, got his ax,
                                    and fixed it some more, I helping him. He then came home and finished
                                    Alvin's job of fixing the old sled. I have omitted to state that yesterday
                                    one of Mr. Dan. Kirk's boys came down to see if Alvin had fixed an old
                                    handsaw of his father's which has been here for a month. Alvin fixed it
                                    to-day (he began it yesterday) and about two o clock took it home. It was a cloudy,
                                    warm day. The snow was wet and slick but did'n't thaw much. It
                                    snowed in little flurries occasionally and at night went at it more steadily
                        Friday, January 7th.
                        A clear day. The mercury stood at zero at sunrise and there was no thawing though not
                                    much freezing merely I guess because everything is frozen that can be. The day was
                                    sacred to hauling logs. There is snow to an average deepness of five inches at
                                    least. Father cut first some sugar-tree logs in the woods across the creek then a
                                    beech tree close to Bain's line14 and almost directly
                                    east from the barn. He hauled the sugars to the house on the bob-sled while Alvin
                                    and I trimmed up the beech and cut it in two. It was limby and knotty, the axes were
                                    dull, and the snow rather cool for the feet. I cut a considerable hole in one of my
                                    leather boots There were 3 beech logs
                        Saturday, January 8th.
                        Clouds obscured the sun for a time this morning but soon cleared away and the rest of
                                    the day was bright but cold. The thermometer varied from 7° to
                                    30° above zero. Father and I started to Martinsville about ten
                                    o'clock We went in the old sled. Sleighing was splendid sledding none the
                                    less so. I took the butter up to W.Ks15 same as on last Saturday
                                    and this time received as a present for myself a copy of
                                    "Haworth's." Similarly also I got another
                                    "wammus", also for myself on the family credit at the store. A
                                    package of all the numbers of Scribner's Monthly for 1880 was handed me
                                    with our mail; it appears that Father had sent for them. He bought a copper
                                    wash-boiler for Mother and I believe a coat for himself was to be got and
                                    was'n't got. The price of butter at the store (our

                                    Making firewood was about all that was done here at home
                        Sunday, January 9th.
                        Not knowing what else to do I went over Jake's hill16
                                    about eleven o'clock stopping a[t] Jack Hinson's17 till some time after dinner. Tom Devore18 with his
                                    family was there. Bill Foster afterwards came walking in alone. Tom and most of the
                                    two families starting off early in the afternoon in their sleigh Bill and I went
                                    with them as far as Howard Bray's19 where we found John
                                        Rodgers20 Stella Foster21 and Flora
                                        Lewis22 visiting and the man of the house gone. We had not
                                    been seated very long when Jack H. put in his appearance having come afoot. He and
                                    Bill left after an hour or so and we youngsters had fun till about night when John
                                    starting to Poplar Grove23 I accompanied him as far as Mt
                                        Olive24 where I stopped for meeting. But few were out. A
                                    sensation was raised by Belle Green25 who got very sick. It
                                    appeared once as if she would actually choke to death. She would strangle, groan,
                                    clutch at her throat with her hands and seemed in great agony. Meeting was dismissed
                                    (it was only a prayer-meeting) she was fanned, snow rubbed over her face, camphor
                                    brought from a house near by, and applied to her face, all without much apparent
                                    benefit Finally a sleigh was run up by hand, she was carried out and placed it and
                                    started home. I got back home by 8.30 o'clock. Nothing noteworthy I believe
                                    occurred here except that Bob Foster was here

                                     for a couple of hours. The day was generally
                                    cloudy and tolerably cold.
                        Monday, January 10th.
                        A day set apart to hauling in our stack of hay. Preparations occupied all the
                                    forenoon. There had to be a good deal of the remains of the old cow-shed removed to
                                    make a road to the cow-barn and the inside of said cowbarn had also to be dealt
                                    with. I not helping in these preparations was kept hanging on the ragged edge of
                                    expectation till about noon when we began to haul. We made five loads of it of which
                                    two went into the old barn and three into the cow-barn. I loaded every one of the
                                    five and pitched one load off the wagon, Father pitched all off the stack and at
                                    least four off the wagon while Alvin mowed the four away. We were till dark getting
                                    done. Mr. Dan. Kirk came down about four o'clock to see about the strange
                                    hog that I turned out of Bill Hand's wheat field and in with our fattening
                                    hogs on the 19th of November last. He was inclined to claim it but would not do so
                                    postively. It was a nice day much like unto yesterday as regards cold but a good
                                    deal sunnier
                        Tuesday, January 11th.
                        A day of fussing around. Wood-making was the principal occupation of the two
                                    "sonnies" while Father appeared to be doing something most of the
                                    time without visible results. About twelve o clock Alvin and I went down to Wats26 and got twelve bushels of wheat in return for several grists
                                    which Wat borrowed of us at different times last spring. We went in the sled. Wm.
                                        Bunton27 was here awhile this morning; to me his errand is
                                    as yet unknown. Mercury 10 degrees below zero this morning, warmer during the day,
                                    and clear.

                        Father went to mill at town to-day in the sled. I went down to see if the hogs had
                                    got in the corn, found none, wandered up the road, met several people and came home

                                    all risks beside. Father and I hauled up three sled-loads or eleven shocks of corn

                                    at till night when it began to snow. It had previously threatened rain all the
                                    morning Bob Foster came while we were putting away our last fodder (we put it all in
                                    the cow-barn) Bob came after the sausage-grinder but it was gone. It seems that Mrs
                                    Pamela Crone is to marry Mr Nathan T. Whitson, familiarly known a[s] Dob Whitson,
                                    this evening. The disparity in their ages and circumstances renders it a noteworthy
                                    affair—if it comes off.33
                        
                        Friday January 14th
                        And it came off. The mercury stood at zero this morning and got some warmer during
                                    the day but cold again at night. The sun shone brightly from rising to setting. This
                                    was a day of small things "Marget" and "Dumby
                                    Billy" Ballinger34 came shortly after breakfast and got
                                    some soap grease and some more soap. Dan Bain35 came around to
                                    look at that strange hog (see last Monday) but would'n't claim it.
                                    I followed him off and gassed to him awhile. Pap went down and laid some rails on
                                    the fence along the top of the levee which had blown off long ago. Alvin and I
                                    fingered over part of the potatoes in the cellar with the result of finding nearly a
                                    peck of rotten ones. I began a letter to Grandmother, and whacked some at the wood
                                    pile.
                        Saturday, January 15th.
                        John Foster came before breakfast to request us to bring his father's mail.
                                    Father and I went to town in the sled, starting after ten o'clock. The ice
                                    nearly mantled all the road and made it very slippery traveling. However we finally
                                    scooted into the city in safety. I believe that no noteworthy purchases were made.
                                    Father made a bid to supply the school-house at town with wood (in conjunction with
                                    Bob Foster) which was accepted, and that is all I know about it. We got home between

                                            13, Nathan T. (Dob) Whitson, twenty-one, a Jefferson Township farm laborer,
                                            married Permelia A. Crone, thirty-four, a township widow. The difference in
                                            "circumstances" presumably refers to her five children.

                                     three and four o'clock. Bro. Runyan36 had an appointment on the creek to-night and I hoofed it over
                                    there. I went to Foster's and staid awhile then walked over to the church
                                    arriving there just as the crowd was dispersing, the preacher having not arrived.
                                    Stood awhile in the road talking to a crowd of boys then came home. While coming I
                                    discovered that one of the young sows had brought forth and was in trouble. I came
                                    to the house and the whole menforce of the family went down. 8 pigs were brought to
                                    the house in a basket, 4 were dead. The mercury was not very low but the air was
                                    very chilly and most of the time the sun was behind clouds. John Kivett was here and
                                    got two more of his cans of fruit.
                        Sunday, January 16th.
                        Those pigs made night somewhat hideous. The mother was brought up, (they first saw
                                    the light in the old straw stack) but did'n't seem to care much
                                    for them. At night the five still living were brought to the house again. I went to
                                    meeting on the creek again in the forenoon. No Runyan appeared and four or five
                                    members read a chapter a few hymns were droned, several laughable incidents occurred
                                    and everybody went home or a-visiting as the case might be. I also went down to
                                    Wat's about sundown stayed till about 9 o clock and came home. Em37 had an ailment composed of catarrh, epizootic, and the effect
                                    of fourteen "yaller powders" in four days so that she
                                    did'n't feel very well. Alvin went up to Jake's and spent
                                    part of the day. No thawing was done to-day and the sun shone only part of the time.
                                    It was'n't very cold.
                        Monday, January 17th.
                        To-day was a day of stand-still as regards the weather. It did'n't
                                    freeze and very little thawing was done. Another building was begun this afternoon.
                                    It is to be composed of the logs hauled from the old church and set a few feet from
                                    the southwest corner of the big crib. It[s] use is not positively known to me yet.
                                    Father was at Robert Foster's most of the forenoon. Dan Bain came here a

                                    making firewood I did nothing. Those pigs have died one by one till all are now

                        She was no better to-day and spent a good deal of the time lying down but
                                    nevertheless did her work. Father and Alvin worked at their log building over half
                                    the day getting all the logs up. I puttered around the house and occasionally made a
                                    few sticks of firewood, to be able to say I had done something. Rhoda Hand38 was here after noon and got another bunch of old papers for
                                    wall uses. The day was cloudy dark and. The mercury stood at or above the freezing
                                    and a little thawing was perceptible. It sprinkled a little just before night.

                                    and roamed the woods not with any desire for killing anything but simply to do
                                    something to get rid of the morbid, restless discontented, almost despairing feeling
                                    that has been on me for ten days. I met various persons during my tour and finally

                                            Gregory, apparently means "hike," although research in
                                            available records and interviews with older residents of 
                                                Morgan County
                                             failed to verify this. "Jook" can also mean
                                            to crouch suddenly, or it can describe corn that falls from the sheaf when

                                    Foster's. Nothing of any importance was done at home. Alvin spent the most
                                    of the time squizzing. Mother felt a little better. The sun was seen once to-day and
                                    only once. The snow got soft and wet, the ice got a little melted and the clouds
                                    hung like a pall over creation making the day, dreary, disconsolate, and depressing.
                        Thursday, January 20th.
                        A dark and gloomy day like yesterday. The mist deepened into rain about noon and kept
                                    at it till night. There was a nastiness that made things look hideous as the bare
                                    ground appeared. But little was done. Alvin squizzed uninterruptedly. About ten o
                                    clock Father and I went into the woods across the creek and hauled to this side two
                                    loads of four foot wood without the sideboards on. This wood by some strange
                                    hocus-pocus I failed to get last fall. He took a load with the side-boards on to
                                    town and delivered it at Ed. Callis's,42 I suppose to
                                    pay for the Gazette. He got back about four o'clock. A blunder which I made
                                    in sending some word to Uncle Rip causes me a great deal of uneasiness. I was up at
                                    No. 4 schoolhouse43 a few moments. Will44
                                    had maybe 15 noisy youngsters.
                        Friday, January 21st.
                        The rain turned to snow during the night for about an inch and a half, was on the
                                    ground this morning. It remained cloudy all day with occasional flashes of the sun
                                    through the broken clouds and it spat snow once in a while. The snow was very wet
                                    but did'n't thaw much. Father footed it to regions unknown to any
                                    of us and was gone till two o'clock. Alvin and I took the

                                    was cut Jan. 5th., got the limbs, which had all been left there. There was a
                                    sled-load of them. We also worked occasionally at making firewood. Mother lacked a
                                    little of being as well as she was yesterday. Her face is occasionally very painful.
                                    Alvin of course lost none of his spare time but squizzed with vim and clatter.
                        Saturday, January 22nd.
                        It spat snow all day without getting much down but began at dark in earnest. It was 4
                                    or 5 degrees below the freezing point. Bob Foster and Bill Hand came soon after
                                    breakfast and about 9 o'clock we started, all four of us to town in the
                                    sled, Bill taking a sack of his wheat along. I was up at Uncle Rip's house
                                    awhile and found that a curious misunderstanding in regard to the
                                    "word" sent last Friday had made a situation a little ludicrous.
                                    But what I had done had not done harm. No notable purchases were made nor was
                                    anything noteworthy done I believe. Alvin squizzed almost without interruption I
                                    believe. We got home about 3.
                        Sunday, January 23rd.
                        The cow Frona had a male calf last night red and white spotted and well formed. It
                                    was still cloudy with the mercury a few degrees below the freezing point. It
                                    "spat" snow in very small quantity occasionally. Everybody staid
                                    at home till after dinner when Alvin and I went up to 
                                        Bethlehem
                                     in the sled. Mr Moore preached a short sermon to a small congregation.
                                    There was very little more snow on the ground than yesterday. Like most other quiet
                                    times this day has not much history.
                        Monday, January 24th.
                        With an accompaniment of considerable jaw the wagon bed was placed and fastened on
                                    the sled a "fixin" made to prevent their getting out at the top
                                    and then two of the fattening hogs, and the "stray" frequently
                                    mentioned before, were taken across, put into the cow-barn, the sled was backed up
                                    to the door and the hogs driven in. The horses were hitched to the sled and Father
                                    and I went to town with it. We had no bad luck. The two fat hogs averaged 290,
                                    "Dan" 190. It was late before we got started back. I spent a great
                                    part of the time in Uncle Rip's office. Mother and Alvin washed. Mr Wm
                                        Elmore45 was here in 
                              
                                 45 William Elmore, thirty-seven, was a Jefferson

                                     the forenoon soliciting subscriptions to the
                                    "Home and Fireside." with heavy inducements in the way of chromos.
                                    No subscribers gained here. Just after we got back Jake Shipley and Sol Fultz,
                                    hucksters, came and bought twelve of our chickens. The day was cloudy and cold with
                                    flurries of snow occasionally by way of variety
                        Tuesday, January 25th.
                        The same kind of weather as yesterday without the snow. Father made two trips with
                                    the sled to Hyndsdale46 after sawdust from where the saw mill
                                    formerly stood at that place. I went with him the last time. Frona's calf
                                    was shut up in a pen made for it in the cow barn. Its name is to be John. Alvin
                                    squizzed away the greater part of the day. Mother is about
                                    entirely recovered
                        Wednesday, January 26th
                        A clear cold day. The wind blew hard from the northwest. There was a little thawing
                                    done in places but only a little. Clouds went south occasionally. Father departed in
                                    the sled for town and was gone the greater part of the day. He got a load of sawdust
                                    a pair of ice-hooks and a pair of breast chains for the harness Alvin squizzed as
                                    usual. It will be a long time yet before the combination saw-mill and lathe is at
                                    work I fear. I fussed around at various things and did'n't spend
                                    much time in the house. I was sent to Bob Foster's about sundown to find
                                    out whether the said Foster was willing to go into partnership with Pap in the ice
                                    business. Found out that he was both willing and expecting to do so. John Kivett was
                                    there also. 9.30 when I got to bed.
                        Thursday, January 27th.
                        Bill Bunton came about 7 o'clock this morning. He thought we had lately
                                    killed hogs and he had come after the heads. He soon left. Bob was on hand with his
                                    sled soon after breakfast, and our team was soon hitched up. Father and Alvin went
                                    while I staid at home. It was two o'clock when they got back from the river
                                    with perhaps 5000 lbs of ice between them. It took till sundown to get it stowed
                                    away in the sawdust in the log building lately put up, at the corner of the big
                                    crib. They 
                              
                                 46 Hynsdale was a small village in south Jefferson
                                            Township founded sometime after the Civil War. In 1880 it contained a
                                            general store, post office, and blacksmith shop. Blanchard, Counties of Morgan,

                                     got stuck twice or rather Bob did while getting
                                    home. I helped Bill Dezzarn a short time in loading logs this morning and chored
                                    around at various things till they got home when I helped them
                                    with the ice. A noteworthy circumstance it is that John the calf eats milk from the
                                    pail without any training whatever. A nearly clear, cold, windy day. Very little
                                    thaw.
                        Friday, January 28th.
                        Another ice day. Foster put in his appearance before eight o'clock. Pap had
                                    to put another "half-sole" or wooden shoe on his sled having
                                    twisted one off yesterday. Alvin and I both staid at home this forenoon. They got
                                    back with the first two loads about noon, put them away and were started back to the
                                    river by two o'clock I went with them then. We were back and had all the
                                    ice stored away before dark. It mounts in all I think to 5 tuns at least. John the
                                    calf for some unknown reason refused to eat to-day. The mercury stood at zero this
                                    morning and 20 above all day. Clear and nice
                        Saturday, January 29th.
                        With the average amount of jaw and fuss the wagon-bed was removed from the sled and
                                    placed upon the wagon, and Pap and I started to town in it. It was nearly noon when
                                    we got there and nearly dark when we got back home. Father bought a new scoopshovel,
                                    got the horses rough shod all around again, and hauled home a load of sawdust. Bob
                                    Foster was in town with his sled and brought a load of sawdust here also. We had
                                    passengers both ways and I had considerable fun while in town. There was a very
                                    disagreeable cold moist air, some thawing in the afternoon, clouds most of the time
                                    and high south winds at night
                        Sunday, January 30th.
                        The snow commenced going off last night and kept at it during the day but not very
                                    fast. The ice was uncovered and made the roads slippery. It was cloudy and misty all
                                    day. I winded my way afoot to "Tater Heaven" where a revival
                                    meeting was going on conducted by Mr Moore and Jonathan Lawrence a 
                                        Quaker
                                     preacher. The latter gentleman was in the last stage of a sermon when I
                                    arrived. His hair was parted in the middle and his little round face was hedged in
                                    by a luxuriant crop of "burnsides." Both hair and whiskers were as
                                    red I think as hair ever grows. His voice was a monotonous "good heavenly
                                    tone" and his language was not always grammatically correct. He is young
                                    and has considerable preaching power. I went to 
                                    Leander Lewis's47 and staid till after
                                    dinner—Some time before dark I went up to Bill Harris s.48 Bill was sick abed with either lung fever or a bad case of epizootic I
                                    did'n't know which Found Mr. Arthur Duly49
                                    there and had a long conversation on religious, political, educational, and social
                                    topics, and accompanied him to night-meeting. Mr Moore took charge mainly.
                                    "Brer Jonathan" preached or tied to but the Spirit moved him to
                                    quit before he had talked very long. Joe Bunton went to the mourner's bench
                                    and Tenie Dezzarn;50 Bill's wife joined the church. I
                                    was home before our clock had struck nine. Wat and Em with their children made the
                                    folks at home a visit while I was gone
                        Monday January 31st.
                        The morning dawned misty and cloudy. It began about the middle of the forenoon to
                                    rain and kept at it. The ice on the ground slowly disappeared and the "wet" land appeared in its hideous barrenness. Alvin and
                                    I hauled up the different piles of clapboards that were scattered around. Some were
                                    made by Hemp Lewis51 two years ago last fall; some by Kivett and
                                        Curtis52 last spring; and some by Hand's boys last
                                    fall. We hauled them up to the ice house and part of them were used to cover it. By
                                    the time it was covered, it began to rain, and sitting in the house was the main
                                    occupation except for Alvin who squizzed
                        Tuesday, February 1st.
                        A day devoted to washing and loafing. Alvin and Mother did the first mentioned,
                                    Father and I the last. Father was up at Bob Foster's a short time in the
                                    forenoon. I believe he went to see about borrowing a scalding barrel. I was up at
                                    the schoolhouse during the noon intermission to hear the news. Mr Stokely Stiles
                                        Sr.53 was here awhile to get Father to do some

                                     appraisement for him. Alvin squizzed what he
                                    could. Foster and Bill Hand began cutting the wood on the other side of the big
                                    creek to supply the town contract. The rain had ceased this morning, everything was
                                    slick and icy and the snow fell in light squalls once in a while. The creek got
                                    bankfull and began flinging the ice out
                        Wednesday, February 2nd
                        It was cloudy this morning at first then the sun shone till afternoon when it clouded
                                    up again. The mercury stood a few degrees below freezing, in the shade and thawing
                                    was only where the sun had the advantage. Father spent the forenoon on the other
                                    side of the creek where Foster and Hand were manufacturing wood. Bill Bunton came
                                    again in quest of hog's heads and about eleven o clock I accompanied him to
                                    where Father was. Tom Newbern54 came while I was there which
                                    was'n't more than an hour and a half. After one o'clock I
                                    hitched to the long-sled. Alvin and I hauled up a rotten ash log from below the
                                    barn. Father went up and put up the top of the tree of which the logs were hauled
                                    the 11th day of last December. After considerable puttering we got down three large
                                    limbs with the log-sled and a load with the other sled of the small limbs Alvin and
                                    I then hauled up a load or three shocks of fodder. Dan Bain were here a moment this
                                    afternoon to borrow a wagon-hammer. Alvin squizzed industriously when he did not
                                    help us.
                        Thursday, February 3rd.
                        A slight coat of snow was on the ground this morning and was increased by small
                                    squalls till noon. It remained partly cloudy till night and was a few degrees colder
                                    than yesterday. Father departed early to Martinsville on Stoke's
                                    appraisement business as per engagement made last Tuesday and
                                    did'n't get home again till four o'clock. Alvin was in
                                    the shop most of the day. That combination machinery resembles Mr Dick's
                                    "Memorial" in David Copperfield, as regards completion. I made
                                    part of the limbs hauled yesterday into firewood. Bob Foster was here awhile this
                                    forenoon to see about sending to town. We made him a present of
                                        Charley's55 old overshoes to wear while his toe was

                        Friday, February 4th
                        The cold had pulled the mercury down very near to zero, this morning. The sun shone
                                    all day in a nearly clear sky but very little thawing was done. Alvin and I were
                                    sent to Bob Foster's with the sled after that scalding barrel. We got a
                                    good deal of ride for it was very slippery on the hills and the sled travelled
                                    sideways as well as endways. We got back alive however; rigged up; killed the last
                                    two of our fattening hogs; had no bad luck, and rested from our labors. Mr Henry
                                        Crone56 was here on his quarterly quarterage-collecting tour
                                    about ten o'clock. He got $1.25 I believe altogether from this
                                    family
                        Saturday, February 5th.
                        Bill Hand came before we had breakfast Bob Foster shortly after. Bill came to get
                                    "a turn of corn" and go to town, Bob came to go to town and get
                                    coffee and coal-oil. Father concluded as there was the usual amount of cutting,
                                    salting, sausage- making, etc. consequent upon hog killing; that he would'n't go to town to-day So we three started about ten
                                    o'clock in the hack The creek had flung cakes of ice into the road in two
                                    places one of which caused a little interruption of our progress. I made a
                                    conditional purchase of a pair of heavy pants at the store and lounged around town
                                    till two o clock when with three additional passengers we started back home. Bill
                                    Hand and Bill Bunton came clear to the house and the rough meat (heads, feet, etc)
                                    of the hogs killed yesterday were bestowed on them, and by them were carried off.
                                    Mrs Nancy Ballinger and a small boy of her kindred were here to borrow or rather get
                                    soap. The day was chilling cold and thinly clouded though the mercury did not stand
                                    very low. The air was damp.
                        Sunday, February 6th.

                                    scattering was able and telling. His magnetic power was exemplified in the
                                    collection for he drew between 25 or 30 dollars out of the pockets of the audience
                                    and kept it in a laughing humor by his wit and liveliness. I spent the time till
                                    night with Doc. Curtis. King. York58 was there and Bill
                                    Fowler's girls.59 At night the Elder preached from that
                                    old subject the Prodigal Son. I had heard Elder Woods handle the same subject in a
                                    powerful sermon and did'n't expect to be much edified by Mr.
                                    Poucher He however struck out on a different course, by running a parallel between
                                    the lives of the young men of to-day and the life of the Prodigal Son. The vivid and
                                    circumstantial manner in which the disgrace and struggles of the young man were
                                    portrayed kept the congregation almost spell-bound. Three mourners came forward in
                                    response to his fervid invitation and till after nine o'clock he worked in
                                    conjunction with the brethren for the souls of those boys but without avail. The
                                    protracted meeting came to a close and about eleven o'clock I was in bed at
                                    home. The day was cloudy. It thawed some little but was chilly and overcoats felt
                                    good. Alvin took a jook over the creek during the day and brought home a
                                    hornet's nest. Nobody of the rest went anywhere or did anything noteworthy.
                        Monday, February 7th
                        The rain commenced to fall during the night and kept at it all day. It froze at first
                                    on the trees but soon thawed off them again. The snow and ice had not nearly all
                                    disappeared at night, nor had it thawed much. The creek was bank full and roared
                                    rather viciously. The business of the day was sitting in the house. Mother did
                                    employ Alvin as assistant in washing,

                                    awhile this forenoon on miscellaneous business. A huckster was also here inquiring
                                    the way to Bob Foster's through the pasture
                        Tuesday, February 8th
                        The rain was still coming down this morning and kept at it but not constantly, all
                                    day. The creek dammed up with the ice which had drifted down against a pile of
                                    driftwood just below our line, was roaring and running over its banks all day. The
                                    fog rolled up and sailed northward. The ground has thawed but little. I took three
                                    distinct "jooks" two down to the creek to see what was happening,
                                    one in the forenoon and one just at night. The other one was taken about four
                                    o'clock. I followed up a sound of chopping which I thought indicated
                                    somebody near and found nobody except Will Bain who was just about leaving his
                                    school-house when I arrived at it. Bob Foster was here a little while this morning
                                    to get some linseed oil. Alvin accompanied him part of his way home and soon after
                                    he got back here was rendered nearly useless by an attack of his old disease the
                                    "lag-leg." Aleck Benge60 was also here about
                                    noon in search of work, he said, but we could'n't supply him.
                                    Father and I hauled up four shocks of fodder on the sled about noon but it was so
                                    nasty that we were glad to quit. Bob and Bill went to work on the wood contract
                                    after noon and kept at it till night. The robins are here in great droves
                        Wednesday, February 9th.
                        The rain was still falling pitilessly this morning when we arose, and had apparently
                                    been at it all night. It rained in pelting showers with intervals of quitting all
                                    day. Clear spots in the sky were occasionally seen but it was raining in hard
                                    showers at night. The creek raised till it broke the road fence in three long gaps,
                                    strewed saw-logs, rails, ice, chunks etc. over John Fowler's wheat, and
                                    finally carried the greater part of the drifted ice down stream with a good deal of
                                    noise. It was falling at last accounts. Our doings were limited to the chores and an
                                    occasional excursion down to watch the progress of the overflowing scourge. I
                                    noticed part at least of Will's school down there during the noon
                                    intermission, and also saw Bob Foster making a tour of observation along the banks.
                                    Will Bain had announced "a spellin'" for tonight but I
                                    presume it was

                                     drowned out. The ground though only partly
                                    thawed is spongy with water. I have a bad cold, Alvin the lag leg.
                        Thursday, February 10th
                        At about 9 o'clock last night the rain quit. It snowed a slight squall this
                                    morning then ceased and remained cloudy and rather sour till night. Nothing of much
                                    importance was done. Father wandered about down at the creek veiwing the desolation.
                                    The road fence is broken in five places and most of the rails gone; John
                                    Fowler's wheat is smeared over with sand and slush in many places, logs,
                                    rails chunks and cakes of ice are scattered over it in great profusion; the road is
                                    in some places hollowed out, in places filled up with sand, and in still other
                                    places blocked with ice. Father made enough fence to keep the cows out of the wheat
                                    and the road, and spent some time over in the woods with Bob Foster who was waiting
                                    for Bill Hand to come. Bill I believe did'n't come. Alvin was in
                                    the shop except a little time while he was helping me at the wood-pile. The world
                                    looks positively filthy to me in its mud and water.
                        Friday, February 11th.
                        It was raining again this morning but stopped and remained cloudy till three
                                    o'clock when it began in showers again Father went off a horseback to
                                    attend Bill Harris's sale114 and was gone till two
                                    o'clock. I wandered down the creek to Bain's drift,
                                    could'n't get across. I trudged up to Foster's, saw Bill
                                    Hand and him heading for the woods across the creek followed them over there and
                                    helped them for three hours or more than came home. Alvin squizzed most of the time,
                                    took I believe one "jook" to the creek.
                        Saturday, February 12th.
                        The howling winds were abroad all last night. It blew in great gusts from the south
                                    from about eight o'clock last night till sundown to-day. A violent snow
                                    storm was also going on most of the time especially after daylight and the snow was
                                    whirled in blinding clouds. Spots of ground were sometimes left bare, or almost so,
                                    and others were covered deep with the drifted snow. It was blown through the
                                    smallest cracks and was an inch deep in the wood-house and shop. The snow ceased at
                                    sundown, the wind still blew, though not so hard. As may be imagined little was done
                                    besides the chores Nobody tried to go anywhere or to do anything outdoors that
                                    was'n't necessary  There was
                                    to have been a Township Institute held on the hill to day but I presume the weather
                                    will be a good excuse for no one's attendance.
                        Sunday, February 13th.
                        It snowed in light squalls occasionally and was disagreeably cold. In fear of another
                                    convulsion of nature nobody got very far from the house till about four
                                    o'clock when I went down to Wat's gassed to Em and him till about
                                    9 o'clock and came home. I spent part of the day in writing a letter to
                                    Grandmother. The road between here and Donald Bain's will have to [be]
                                    worked before it will be safe to drive teams over it as great holes are scooped out
                                    of it.
                        Monday, February 14th.
                        It was clear this morning and the mercury stood at zero. Thin clouds were around at
                                    night. Father went to town afoot with the basket of butter. He was gone most of the
                                    day of course. I passed the greater part of the day in cutting down and trimming up
                                    a beech tree just east of the mouth of the lane or at the corner of Bill
                                    Hand's wheatfield. Alvin and Mother cleansed the clothes of the household
                                    once more. After they were done Alvin and I hauled up a sled load of fodder and also
                                    a sled load of limbs of the tree which I cut. Wat came this evening and got Hemp the
                                    hog. The O'Neals went into the clover patch corn to-day and began gathering
                                    it.
                        Tuesday, February 15th.
                        And they were at it to-day also. The day was not very cold but not very much thawing
                                    was done. Enough was done though to make it disagreeable hauling. Alvin and I hauled
                                    the remainder of the limbs cut yesterday (one sled-load) then hitched to the
                                    log-sled and hauled the two logs the body of the tree made. The first or biggest log
                                    came near "stalling" the team, the second one was no trouble.
                                    After that we went down to the creek close to Fowler's line and brought a
                                    dry log or water-gate pole that the creek had washed there. Father was gone from 10
                                    o'clock till two about the vicinity of Fowler's and old Stokely
                                    Stiles The Rev. Mr Moore spent the afternoon and dined with us. John Fowler was here
                                    after the sausage mill for Mr Stiles's folks this morning.
                        
                        Wednesday, February 16th.
                        Jake came down about ten o clock en route for Fowler's He
                                    stopped here awhile and when he went on I went with him. I was at Fowler's
                                    awhile and at noon went on over to Effie's school to be present at
                                    "Commencement" as this was the last day. A dozen or fifteen
                                    visitors in all, I guess, came during the course of the afternoon. There were three
                                    lessons recited, the rest of the time being given to declamations readings, closing
                                    act of prize presenting etc. All went off smoothly and nicely all things considered.
                                    The "school marm" went afoot home with Wat. I went down to Mrs
                                        Allen's61 with Will Bain staid till dark and went
                                    with him to meeting at 
                                        Bethlehem
                                    . A not very big congregation listened to a good sermon from Mr. Moore
                                    which was succeeded by an exhortation wrenched from the quivering lungs of Hemp
                                    Lewis and delivered at the top of his powerful voice. The preacher was twice moved
                                    to hint very plainly about order. I got home at nine o'clock. Father went
                                    down to the creek this morning, got in and got his feet wet. The O'Neals
                                    were still gathering corn in the clover patch to-day. Father afterwards went down to
                                    the creek road and broke the ice that was in it. The day was nearly clear and not
                                    uncomfortably cool.
                        Thursday, February 17th.
                        A day set apart for hauling. We went down to the creek and after helping haul out a
                                    wagon that was stuck in the creek (the ford is full of quicksand now) we gathered,
                                    and hauled up a sled-load of drift-wood to the house then went down into the pasture
                                    and hauled up two more loads of "picked up" wood a rather
                                    rubbishing lot. Next we hauled up a load of fodder. After dinner Father took the
                                    scalding-barrel borrowed a week ago Friday, home again after which he and I hauled
                                    up two more loads of fodder. It had been cloudy and chilly all day and about four
                                    o'clock it went to pelting down snow and sleet. This storm however did not
                                    last very long. Alvin was nearly sick and did not do anything of any importance
                                    to-day 
                                        Jasper
                                     Foster came this forenoon and got our cross-cut saw to work on the wood
                                    contract with. The O'Neals got all their corn out to-day I believe.
                        
                           
                              61 Mrs. Allen's was the farm of Christina Allen,
                                        seventy, worked by her son-in-law, Christopher Cornwall, thirty-three. Ibid., 175.
                        
                        
                        Friday, February 18th.
                        It rained at least a good part of last night and for an hour or so this morning. It
                                    also drizzled fogged or rained the rest of the day. It snowed slightly just at
                                    night. Nothing of much moment was attempted. I whacked at the wood-pile frequently.
                                    Father chored around and made frequent pedestrian trips to the creek. One stranger
                                    rode up to inquire about the ford, two other men went up through to
                                    Foster's ford Bill Hand was here this afternoon to get another turn of
                                    corn. I passed some time pleasantly with Dan Bain who was feeding his calves above
                                    here. Alvin was about the same.
                        Saturday, February 19th.
                        Bill Hand came soon this morning and got 2 sacks of corn in the ear or rather had
                                    them taken to town. Father Bill and I bumped over the frozen roads to town in the
                                    big wagon. I did nothing noticeable except forget my overcoat and leave it in town.
                                    I got the last payment or final one rather on the Mrs. Garrison and Ira Moore62 notes amounting to $37, of Riley Nosier.63 Father got himself a cast maul and I brought another pair of
                                    breeches out but I guess with the same result as on Feb. 5th. A letter from
                                    Grandmother was received. She appears to have had the rheumatism and talks rather
                                    doubtfully about coming out here but still hopefully. We had a load of passengers
                                    coming home and it was nearly five o'clock before we got there. There was a
                                    slight coat of snow on the ground but the sky soon cleared. It then became nice
                                    overhead and nasty underfoot, and warm enough to be comfortable. The calf John was
                                    turned into the "orchard" to-day
                        Sunday, February 20th.
                        It froze last night and thawed this day, in fact it was such another day as yesterday
                                    except that it clouded up before night and began to rain. I geared up in my best
                                    "bib and tucker" including the breeches I bought yesterday and
                                    went over to the creek church. I saw but two souls there and there seemed to have
                                    been a misunderstanding on my part. One of the two "souls" was
                                    Alfred Kivett and I went with him over to John Kivett's. We found nobody
                                    but the women folks at home and 
                              
                                 62 Mrs. Garrison was not identified with certainty.
                                            Ira Moore was probably George I. Moore, twenty-five, a Jefferson Township
                                            farm laborer. Ibid., 175.
                              
                                 63 William Riley Nosier, forty-three, ran a saw mill
                                            in Jefferson Township. He was born in 
                                                Owen County
                                            , Indiana, on November 9, 1835, and moved to 
                                                Morgan County
                                             in 1876. Ibid., 176; Blanchard, Counties of Morgan,

                                     soon took our separate ways to our own homes. I
                                    began another letter to Dwight Calhoun64 which will probably
                                    share the fate of its predecessor. Alvin was if anything worse and Father did not
                                    get any great distance from the house. The O Neals have had some stock in the clover
                                    patch field since they got the corn out.
                        Monday, February 21st.
                        That mingled snow and rain was in very small quantity. It froze last night and thawed
                                    to day, one in about equal extent with the other. The sun shone brightly all day and
                                    there were very few clouds. Hauling wood was the principal business of the day. The
                                    wood was some more of that cut by Ballinger's last spring Father and I
                                    hauled one load before noon. After dinner he took the Ira Moore note and some money,
                                    went up to Mr Rodger's,65 found Mrs Moore there
                                    delivered her the note and $6 in money thus ending the complicated
                                    history of those two notes. I continued hauling wood and got three loads over before
                                    night. I was assisted somewhat by Alvin who spent the intervals between loads where
                                    Foster and Hand were at work on the wood contract. One of O Neal's cows was
                                    sick and this afternoon on receipt of the intelligence from Father, at least seven
                                    men from the "city" were down trying to doctor her.
                        Tuesday, February 22nd.
                        About ten o'clock Father started a-horseback to town. I chored around at
                                    various things till after noon when I rode Hemp the hoss barebacked up the road to
                                    Big Nathe Whitson's gassing a good while to different people along the
                                    road. At Whitson's I got the old saddle which Nathe had borrowed last
                                    summer. It was apparently as good as when it left except that the girth was broke. I
                                    rode up and staid a few moments where Foster and Hand were at the wood and got home
                                    at four o'clock. About a half hour later Father also came home. He brought
                                    my overcoat with him, and some clover seed. Alvin had so far recovered that he
                                    squizzed some and attempted mauling rails to a small extent. Father paid Alvins tax
                                    and mine in full for the 
                              
                                 64 Dwight Calhoun was a distant cousin of William
                                            Gregory. Dwight's mother, Lucy Hitchcock, was one of William
                                            Gregory's mother's aunts. Charles Harrison,

                                    out of the "clover-patch" on a sled with four horses. It was the
                                    same freeze and thaw as yesterday but was warmer and muddier.
                        Wednesday, February 23rd.
                        It sprinkled a little last night then got cold and remained disagreeably so all day.
                                    It was cloudy and the air was filled occasionally with flying frost or snow. Very
                                    little thawing. Alvin and I spent the most of the forenoon in spasmodic attacks with
                                    saw and ax on the wood-pile. Pap was gone till noon to a region which included where
                                    Foster and Hand were at work. He was also there this afternoon taking Bill Hand some
                                    meat he had sold to him. Alvin and I sawed an oak log in two that lay a short
                                    distance east of the stable. Alvin and Father between them made one of the cuts up
                                    into rails. I watched Dan and Will Bain cut down, and saw partly up, a tree not far
                                    from here
                        Thursday, February 24th
                        I wended my way afoot to Jake's, soon after breakfast to find out whether to
                                    haul him some fodder or not. Finding it to be immaterial I got him to get me some
                                        "spignet"66 and came home. I hitched to
                                    the sled and hauled away that part of the north line fence which helped form the
                                    lane at the end of Bill Hand's wheat field. I took the rails down to the
                                    creek and left them there to be used in rebuilding the road fence. There were about
                                    five sled loads of rails and I hauled the chunks left in the lane to the house.
                                    Father split up the remaining part of the logs begun yesterday and put up part (8
                                    panels I believe) of the rails which I hauled down to the creek. Alvin and Mother
                                    washed. The day was generally cloudy, the ground thawed but little and the air was
                                    disagreeably cold
                        Friday, February 25th.
                        Father departed to town a-horseback to attend court. Alvin attempted to split up a
                                    rail cut left of a stave-tree cut on the point west of the house and did split the
                                    most of it into rails. I worked at stowing wood away in the woodhouse and also
                                    splitting some. At noon Father returned (the case had been put off,) and soon went
                                    down and put up the rest of the rails I hauled 
                              
                                 66 This is a variant spelling of

                                     yesterday. Alvin and I took down part of the
                                    fence back of the orchard. Extending both end fences to Bain's line we
                                    destroyed the lane back of the orchard and had about a hundred or so rails to haul
                                    down to the road, I only got one sled load hauled however. Sayroy Kivett67 and Morgan Secrest were here hunting Father this afternoon
                                    for a moment. A day sunshiny and cool, rather pleasant. Froze last night and thawed
                                    to-day as usual.

                        Father went down and laid up the rails hauled yesterday. I fussed around till he came
                                    back, which last happened about ten o'clock He and I then got ready and
                                    went to town in the hack. I spent most of the time at Uncle Rip's house as
                                    I did not feel very well. We started back home about two o'clock. It had
                                    looked rather threatening all the morning and sprinkled smartly several times during
                                    the afternoon. It was a warmer day than we have had since last October we think.
                                    Alvin spent all the time we were gone with Foster and Hand. They did not work at the
                                    wood yesterday. Bob Foster's boys brought home about 20 pounds of fresh
                                    "belly" to pay for some that Bob borrowed long ago.
                        Sunday, February 27th.
                        It was raining when we awoke and kept at it till noon when it turned to squalls of
                                    snow and the wind was occasionally high We all staid quietly in the house or not far
                                    from it waiting for the moving of the waters. It turned a good deal colder before
                                    night
                        Monday February 28th.
                        The snow was nearly three inches deep at daylight and had drifted considerably. It
                                    snowed in squalls more or less hard all day. Nothwithstanding this Father went off
                                    riding Hemp, professedly to Herbemont or as it is generally called
                                    Pine City.68 He was gone about five hours and got back by two
                                    o'clock. We had two visitors. Bob Foster came to bring the sausage-grinder
                                    home and staid three hours. He went away a little after noon.

                                    he had any especial business it is unknown to me. Nothing of much account was done.
                                    I got down the sap boiling pans and put them to soak
                        Tuesday, March 1st.
                        The sun shone brightly from rising to setting. The snow disappeared mostly in places
                                    with a southern exposure. Father went to the woods across the creek but no one was
                                    there and he returned to the house and made a handle for an ax he bought last Friday
                                    I suffered from griping pains in the abdomen all last night and the greater part of
                                    to-day Father and I went down to the creek after dinner. He waded across the creek
                                    and spent the rest of the day with Foster and Hand who-were at work this afternoon.
                                    John Kivett was also there. I came back saddled up old Colonel and took a ride for
                                    the benefit of the bellyache. Had a gas with John Fowler and one or two others.
                                    Alvin squizzed a little.
                        Wednesday, March 2nd.
                        It rained and sleeted a little last night but the sun shone through thin clouds all
                                    of to-day; and there was some more thaw than yesterday. John Fowler and I were
                                    thinking of opening the sugar camp on the upper eighty in partnership to-day. He was
                                    over before breakfast this morning and after consultation we agreed not to do
                                    anything to-day. After breakfast Father and I "rung" the noses of
                                    the nine pigs69 and otherwise attended to them. Then we hauled
                                    two sled-loads or eight shock of fodder up. After dinner he went down and chopped
                                    awhile in Bain's drift while I hauled a sled-load of rails from here to the
                                    creek, picked up a few drifted ones and hauled them into more convenient position
                                    then came back up on the hill made things right or partly so, up there, then
                                    unhitched, and went over across the creek to where Foster and Hand were at work and
                                    had been since morning. Father was there twice during the course of the afternoon to
                                    borrow and return an ax. The old beehive was opened to-day, quite a lot of honey
                                    both good and bad, both capped and uncapped was found in it but every bee was dead.
                                    Alvin remained at the house to help do the washing.

                        Thursday, March 3rd.
                        There was a thunder-storm up north for a part of the night and this morning there
                                    began a series of snow squalls accompanied by wind which lasted all day with but
                                    small intermissions. The sun looked forth once or twice for very brief periods.
                                    Nothing could be done or was done besides the chores. Father I believe made one trip
                                    to the big-road and back and I began a letter to Mr. John Harmon one of
                                    Charlie's cronies formerly. We carried the other hive of bees downcellar My

                        Friday, March 4th.
                        The snow squalls continued all last night and all day today. About eleven
                                    o'clock I rigged up and went over to Fowler's to attend
                                    John's "Infair" as per invitation received from John
                                    himself last Tuesday. About 18 were present besides the family I believe. Except
                                    that I made a couple of stupid blunders I believe everything went off smoothly and
                                    everybody enjoyed themselves. I was back home by five o'clock. Father spent
                                    the time that I was gone at Bob Foster's Alvin cut down a tree above the
                                    "orchard" for backlogs My old tooth if anything was worse.
                        Saturday, March 5th.
                        The snow-squalls continued with as much severity as before, but were fewer and
                                    farther between. There is about two inches of snow on the top of the mud as a result
                                    of this storm. As Bob was going with the hack to town to-day Father took the butter
                                    and went afoot to the road to wait for him. After waiting awhile he concluded Robert
                                    had gone. He came back and had got a horse out of the stable, when he espied Bob in
                                    the dim distance and hoofed it back to the road again. He got back home about five
                                    o'clock. I fussed around at various things of small importance. Had a
                                    considerable chat with Dan Bain in the forenoon My old tooth was not so painful
                        Sunday, March 6th.
                        I took the rather foolish course to-day (considering what would probably happen
                                    tomorrow) of going to Mt Olive M[ethodist] E[piscopal] Church afoot. Mr. Jonathan
                                    Laurence held forth and the Spirit moved him to hold a short prayermeeting, preach a
                                    short disconnected and rather laughable sermon and then hold a prayer meeting
                                    besides. I spent the  time till night at 
                                        Madison
                                     Hinson's and went with him to prayer-meeting at night
                                    "Brer Jonathan" was there and interjected a short sermon. Sam
                                        Woods70 came near causing trouble between himself and Will
                                    Bain by some very personal remarks which he made while giving in his
                                    "sperience" which remarks Will thought were directed at himself. I
                                    got home about ten o'clock. The day was cloudy from sunrise to sunset.
                                    Nothing of any importance transpired while I was gone I believe.
                        Monday, March 7th.
                        We went to work, scalded the buckets, hauled them up to the camp together with the
                                    other implements. Father started to Kivett's to hunt some irons but found
                                    neither the irons nor the man till he went to where Foster and Hand were at work at
                                    the wood. Then he did'n't get the irons. He came back and tapped
                                    trees till noon while we distributed our buckets. John Fowler121
                                    my partner in the "camp" came over at noon we tapped trees till we
                                    used all of our buckets, while Alvin fixed the boiling place. We went over to
                                    Fowler's with the wagon by hitching his horse and Hemp to it, got a load of
                                    dry wood, an old boiling- pan, 16 more buckets and came back. John was obliged to go
                                    to Jack Hinson's and went afoot across the hills. He got back about
                                    supper-time, ate here, gassed awhile and went on home. It was a sunshiny partly
                                    cloudy day, thawed gradually and the sap ran gloriously. I was not feeling very well
                                    as the neuralgic face pains afflicted me somewhat.
                        Tuesday, March 8th.
                        It began raining during the night and was at it a good deal of the time to-day. John
                                    and I hauled up two barrels of sap, then Father and he went over to Rob't.
                                    Foster's and got a lot of plank with which when they got back we made a
                                    shed. They then hauled up some wood by which time it was noon. After dinner I
                                    did'n't go up till four o'clock and then
                                    did'n't stay long. Father and John got in the rest of the sap. The
                                    total amount of sap is I believe about four barrels and a half, so far. John went
                                    back home about four o'clock, and Pap went and filled up after supper.
                                    Mother and Alvin cleansed the cloths etc. once more. Felt rather better than

                        Wednesday, March 9th
                        We hauled in two barrels of sap to-day and carried about a half barrel. We
                                    "stirred off' twice, once this forenoon and once about eight
                                    o'clock at night, getting between four and five gallons of pretty thick
                                    syrup each time of which John got one-third. We hauled up a lot of wood and made
                                    some of an ash log that was handy. We had four visitors during the day
                                    John's father-in-law Mr. J. J. Hinson, John's wife Dora and her
                                    sister Bell and lastly Miss Tenie Fowler. Mr Hinson came in the forenoon, the rest
                                    in the afternoon. Father "over-saw" us most of the time though he
                                    was gone for a couple of hours after dinner to where Foster was at work with his two
                                    little boys on the wood contract Bill Hand having been temporarily disabled by
                                    neuralgia. Alvin was also with us a good part of the time. The day was cloudy and
                                    reasonably warm. I felt no better owing to an hurting in my breast
                        Thursday, March 10th.
                        It cleared off about noon or nearly cleared. We got in about two barrels of sap this
                                    morning and two this afternoon, tapped more trees till we used up the Fowler buckets
                                    and some few good troughs and stirred off again at about eight o'clock at
                                    night. At noon Bill Hand again giving out John was hired to help Foster but Foster
                                    not knowing of it came down to the boiling place a-visiting with John Kivett. They
                                    did'n't stay long however. Oily Hinson71 also
                                    came and sojourned in the neighborhood till after we "stirred
                                    off." Father and I put in the time from noon till well towards night
                                    hauling fodder getting 17 shocks into the barn. John came around as we got the last
                                    in, and he and I helped by Oily gathered in our afternoon sap. Foster visited us
                                    again for a few moments and took Oily off with him to supper while John came here
                                    for his. Foster, his two boys and Oily were present when we "stirred
                                    off." Wat Harrison came this afternoon and got a sow, one of the two
                                    younger ones, which he had bargained for long ago. We had about five gallons of good
                                    syrup to-night.
                        Friday, March 11th.
                        It froze a little last night but grew cloudier and chillier all day spitting a little
                                    snow or rain once in a while. We went to work hauled rails from Bain's
                                    drifts, picked them up off of 
                              
                                 71 Oliver R. Hinson, thirteen, was a laborer working
                                            on the farm of his father, Joseph G. Hinson. Ibid.,
                                        172.
                           
                                     John's wheat field, and completed the
                                    fence around said field. John helped us. We then gathered in a little over two
                                    barrels of sap, and Father and John spent the afternoon in boiling it down. They got
                                    a little more syrup than they had at any one time before; between five and six
                                    gallons. Only one visitor was present at the "stir-off,"
                                    John's brother Walter. It was nearly dark when Father got home. Alvin was
                                    working around the house all day. I felt well to-day but weak in the legs
                        Saturday, March 12.
                        John came over soon and going up into the camp turned all the buckets and troughs
                                    bottom upwards. It rained occasionally in very hard spurts last night and to-day.
                                    Father and I went to town in the hack. The roads are fearfully
                                    muddy—almost impassible in places I subscribed for the weekly N.Y. Herald
                                    was up at Uncle Rip's a little while, took them a gallon of the new-made
                                    molasses, and got a big jug of hers to put more in. Father also bought some jugs for
                                    our own use. John Foster was down this morning to send after his Father's
                                    mail; John Kivett was here in the afternoon to get a can or two of fruit, and Bill
                                    Hand came towards night to get some meal. We had taken some two sacksfull of corn
                                    from our crib to be ground for him. Celeste Johnson and Sallie Rodgers72 rode over with us as we came back. There was meeting on the creek at
                                    night. Bro. Runyan did put in an appearance this time and preached
                                    or tried with his usual success. A child of Mrs Meter Benge's73 was here after soap-grease, but also was sent empty handed away
                        Sunday, March 13th.
                        A cloudy blustering raw cold day, somewhat disagreeable. I attended meeting on the
                                    creek twice. Rev. Runyan gave the "non-essential" men a blizzard
                                    in the morning and insisted on the necessity of baptism to salvation. In the evening
                                    as a farewell effort he got in a hit at nearly everything opposed to him displayed
                                    some rather crude and wild geographical and Biblical ideas and employed some rather
                                    mixed figures of speech. Father was up at Bob Foster's awhile in the
                                    evening. Jhpu tbdlfe bj Sbdifm Cspxo.74

                        Joe Ballinger and Aleck Benge came early to get the saw. They helped Bob and Bill
                                    Hand at the wood contract all day. John, Pap, and Alvin, "ran" the
                                    sugar camp to-day, got about 5 barrels of sap and had three visitors John's
                                    wife Mattie Foster and Tenie Fowler. I was detailed to act as clerk of the board of
                                    a special election to vote on the Amendments to the state Constitution.75 Will Bain was the other clerk and Jack Hinson and Henry
                                        Fowler76 were the judges, Wat of course being inspector. We
                                    had a pretty good time; 88 votes being cast during the day we had no very hard work.
                                    We began counting out at four o'clock and by six were at home. I made some
                                    blunders on the tally sheets which kept us longer than would have been necessary had
                                    I been "up to business" There was a tolerably hard freeze last
                                    night and it was nearly clear and thawed nicely all day. Father's 52nd

                        Tuesday, March 15th.
                        It did not freeze hard enough last night to make this a good
                                    "sugar-day". It was warm nearly clear and sunshiny all day. We got
                                    in about 3 barrels of sap by night. Had a stir-off this forenoon and got about five
                                    gallons of syrup. Will and Dan Bain were present. Father went to town after dinner
                                    John and I worked Hemp or Dave and John's own horse as they did yesterday.
                                    Alvin was not there having to help wash. Foster and Hand put in the time cutting
                                    down trees to-day. We had another "stir-off' at night at which I
                                    was not present having a considerable toothache and neuralgia. Father got home about
                                    eleven o'clock with four gallons of syrup.
                        Wednesday March 16th.
                        It was raining when we awoke, and kept somewhat misty and damp and cloudy all day.
                                    Bob Foster was here awhile this morning, got a pair of gate hinges which had been
                                    bought for

                                             electorate dealt with white-black relations, residency
                                            requirements, the date of the general election, judicial powers, and
                                            stipulations on local governments incurring debts. This special election was
                                            held in March, 1881, in order that a majority of voters would support the
                                            measures. During the previous fall, the amendments had failed to achieve a
                                            majority of all votes, although more votes were cast for
                                            them than against. See Charles Kettleborough, Constitution

                                    fixed things up a little, gassed around awhile and came home. John Fowler came about
                                    noon and borrowed the post auger. The old sow, Keziah by name gave birth this
                                    afternoon to nine pigs. Foster and Hand neither one worked at the wood to-day I
                                    believe. I did not do much of anything nor in fact did any of us. I suffered some
                                    little again from neuralgia but otherwise felt well.
                        Thursday, March 17th.
                        It rained some little last night but was clear and warm to-day. Father went and
                                    inverted the buckets up at the sugarcamp to wait for better days. He went over the
                                    creek and helped Foster and Hand till noon. Alvin and I chored around but felt like
                                    we did'n't have to do much. John Bain came to borrow the
                                    post-auger and was sent to Fowler's. After dinner we hauled two loads of
                                    course gravel from the sugar camp branch and put it down by the watering-trough
                                    where it had become very muddy. Alvin and I then went in the wagon to Wat's
                                    where we got our breaking plow which has been there ever since the 13th. of last
                                    October. We also got one of the township road-scrapers. Not a soul was at home at
                                    Wat's. Three of the first of old Keziah's pigs disappeared last
                                    night. The cause is not known here.
                        Friday, March 18th.
                        Still another one was gone this morning and she was put into the buggy shed for
                                    to-night. The day began clear and bright, and closed with a sky that threatened
                                    rain. Alvin has been for several days cutting up some beech trees just above the
                                    "orchard" the idea being to make a potato patch up there. I helped
                                    him saw up the body of one of the trees this forenoon. Father spent the forenoon
                                    helping Foster and Hand again. After dinner he and I plowed and scraped up a small
                                    levee near the junction of the Ballingertown branch and the big creek. It was pretty
                                    hard on both horses and men. We picked up a wagon load composed of driftwood and
                                    fencerails near our line. Alvin worked away at his potato patch most of the
                                    afternoon.

                                    forenoon after soap-grease. They got a small supply and also a bone with a small
                                    amount of meat on it.

                        Saturday, March 19th.
                        It rained in showers all of last night and up to nearly ten o'clock today
                                    when the wind began to blow hard from the south and west. It grew colder and
                                    occasional small spurts of snow flakes fell. Bill Hand came shortly after breakfast
                                    and about ten o'clock Father and he started in the hack to town. Nothing
                                    was done here as it was too bad and threatening weather to be out doors. Father got
                                    back about four o'clock He brought a letter from Grandmother who, it
                                    appears, is in fair health and inclined to stay where she is. John Foster was here a
                                    moment in the evening after his Father's mail.
                        Sunday, March 20th
                        I suffered with pain in the face so last night that I did not go upstairs to bed till
                                    after twelve o'clock but I slept soundly from that time till morning. The
                                    snow fell all night or apparently did. It was an inch or so deep this morning, and
                                    dribbled down all day but thawed off faster than it came Nobody got very far from
                                    the house to-day. I did not suffer any to-day from neuralgia
                        Monday, March 21st.
                        It froze a good deal last night having cleared off. As it promised to be a good
                                    sugar-day we freshened the trees. But it clouded up and cold wind blew. We only got
                                    about three barrels of sap. Two visitors shed the light of their countenances upon
                                    us: Bob Foster and Albert Bishop.78 Aleck Benge I believe also
                                    stopped for a bit while passing. John did not come to-day but sent a deputy in the
                                    person of Willis Reid a youngster who is just now in the vicinity. Bill Hand did not
                                    show himself to-day so that Foster and he cut no wood to-day. Old Keziah's
                                    last pigs disappeared last night. It is about concluded that she ate them, as she
                                    and they were housed securely last night I suffered a good deal from neuralgia and
                                    chilliness. They "siruped down to night Pap brought home about a gallon and
                                    a half of sirup. Mother and Alvin washed.
                        Tuesday, March 22nd
                        A cloudy day with occasional sunshine and a cool north wind. The harvest of sap was
                                    about five barrels. I did not do

                                    yaller powders. This combination of toothache, neuralgia and fever is an unmitigated
                                    nuisance. I did go up to the camp a short while in the afternoon. Reid, John and Pap
                                    were all there. The visitors were; Billy Ballinger in the afternoon and Oliver
                                    Hinson and Thomas Devere at night. Alvin was gyrating around at various places
                                    during the day. A gay time was had in the sugar camp at night. John Foster and Say
                                    Kivett were there besides those already mentioned. Two of them went to
                                    Foster's got a stove kettle and they then cooked down about three pints of
                                    syrup to sugar. I was not able to be there.
                        Wednesday, March 23rd.
                        Wat came early in the day to see if he could have the use of the sugar camp. He had
                                    got John's consent and Pap's was easily obtained I was not asked.
                                    I took three yaller powders and was rendered incapable of duty. Father spent the
                                    forenoon helping Foster and Hand, (who also, I have omitted to mention were at work
                                    yesterday.) Alvin fumed around in search of something to do that suited him. After
                                    dinner he and Father cut down one oak tree that stood close to the boiling place.
                                    Wat put in his appearance in the shank of the afternoon gathered sap and went to
                                    boiling. His visitors were Reid, Billy Ballinger, and myself I came home and began a
                                    letter to Grandmother. There was a pretty snug freeze last night and it was cloudy
                                    but not very cool all day. In the afternoon there was a very good run of sap.
                        Thursday, March 24th.
                        Father went to mill at Martinsville this morning and was gone till three
                                    o'clock Mr Henry Fowler was here a few moments to see about getting a fro,
                                    just before Pap left. It froze hard last night, and was only partially cloudy with a
                                    south wind. Wat had the best run of the season, getting six barrels of sap. Some of
                                    us were around the camp nearly all the time I spent most of the forenoon and a short
                                    time in the afternoon up there, Alvin was there a good while in the forenoon and
                                    lastly Father was up with him a short time in the afternoon and a good while after
                                    supper. Wat stirred off in the afternoon and got four or five gallons of syrup.
                                    There was a good deal of rattling noise over the creek to-day for John Kivett and
                                    son were helping Foster and Hand. The four claimed that they sawed twelve cords Wat
                                    came and boiled after dark John Kivett and Bob Foster were his visitors besides Pap
                                    who did'n't  get home till ten
                                    o'clock. I finished and sent my letter to Grandmother.
                        Friday, March 25th.
                        It did not freeze last night. To-day was cloudy and threatening with little spurts of
                                    hail, rain, snow, and sleet, very little most of them were. I
                                    spent two hours in the sugar-camp with Wat, the rest of the time in the house or
                                    doing little chores around it. Father was occupied during most of the forenoon in
                                    hauling in the last of the fodder, (twenty-two shocks). Alvin helped him. After
                                    dinner Father divided his time about equally between the sugar-camp, and Foster and
                                    Hand. Alvin has been occupied part of these two days in fixing the kitchen windows
                                    in rolling order. Fanny Sloan was here with a girl unknown to us, to beg for
                                    soap-grease but she got none. Wat stirred off before night and quit. I had another
                                    attack of tooth and face ache after supper.
                        Saturday, March 26th.
                        Albert Bishop came early and borrowed the brace and bit to freshen the trees with.
                                    There was a slight coating of snow on the ground this morning but the sky was clear
                                    and the bare spots at least were frozen hard. A cold wind blew, sometimes hard from
                                    a northerly direction but still thawing went on, except in the shade, through the
                                    day. Father went to town in the hack pretty early and stayed till about 5
                                    o'clock; I mean it was that time when he got home. Alvin fussed around; got
                                    wood etc. I did what I have been doing all the week. My jaw opens half an inch yet.
                                    There is no pain as a general thing, no swelling either visible or feelible that can
                                    account for this phenomenon. I was out of the house but little to-day. Bill Hand was
                                    here just at night after some meal. Father took two bushels of corn to mill for him
                                    last Thursday
                        Sunday, March 27th
                        There was a good sugar-day—tolerably good that is—today. Wat
                                    boiled all day and had as "visiting statesmen" Father twice myself
                                    twice, and Alvin twice. We were not all there at any one time very long however.
                                    Then there were Dan Bain, Isaac 
                                        Kent
                                    
                           79 and two boys, two of the Garrison boys and a
                                        
                              
                                 79 Isaac

                                            , forty-four, was a Jefferson Township farmer. U.S., Tenth

                                     Benge boy and lastly John Kivett. So that he
                                    was not lonesome. It was a partly cloudy, sunshiny day which began cool and got
                                    warmer before night. Aside from the sugar camp there is nothing noteworthy I
                                    believe. Wat boiled down all the sap he had which took till ten o'clock in
                                    the night
                        Monday March 28th.
                        There was no freeze last night and it kept threatening rain more and more till noon
                                    when in gradually increasing sprinkles it began and about dark began pouring down in
                                    regular style. During the forenoon Father sowed clover-seed on Bill Hand's
                                    wheatfield. Alvin went over and helped Foster and Hand pile wood part of the
                                    forenoon. He and Father were there all the afternoon. I "jooked"
                                    up to the camp and found John Kivett there trying to make some molasses for himself
                                    on a very small run of sap. Wat brought the sled home about noon. Jake was here upon
                                    the same unknown errand as before for a while in the afternoon. This morning the cow
                                    "Heifer" gave birth to an almost entirely red, big calf, of the
                                    male sex.
                        Tuesday, March 29th.
                        The rain kept on till sometime in the night when it turned to snow and this morning
                                    it was four inches in depth and continued to come all day, without however getting
                                    much more down. Nothing of much importance was done here. We sat in the house and
                                    hoped for better times. John Kivett was here most of the afternoon. He had been in
                                    the camp, turned the water out of the buckets and set them up in expectation of sap.
                        Wednesday, March 30th
                        I do'n't know whether it snowed all night or not but I am certain
                                    that it came down from sunrise to sunset to-day. It did not visibly increase to any
                                    great extent the amount on the ground but rendered out-door life rather
                                    disagreeable. We sat in the house as we did yesterday. Father was outdoors for a
                                    couple of hours after dinner, the rest of us did'n't get farther
                                    than a little beyond the stable.
                        Thursday, March 31st.
                        It was warm enough to thaw vigorously and the [sun] shone most of the time till about
                                    three o'clock when snow squalls began coming. The snow pelted down in good
                                    measure. The week's washing was done which kept Mother and Alvin employed
                                    most of the time Father was gone most of the forenoon,  he said to see Mr Stoke Stiles Sr. Kivett was at work
                                    in the sugar-camp this afternoon. I was up there a few moments. He got between 3 and
                                    four barrels of sap. I knocked around out doors considerably but it was rather
                                    disagreeable as the wind blew hard occasionally. A nastier time I never saw
                        Friday, April 1st.
                        No pranks played here on anyone that I know of, on account of All-Fool's
                                    Day. It was a continuation of the same kind of weather. The mercury hovered at or
                                    about the freezing point and snow drizzled down all day. The amount on the ground
                                    did not appear to be increased much. Jake came down this morning and lugged a
                                    sack-full of corn in the ear home on his shoulder. Alvin went off with him and it
                                    was four o'clock when he got back home. Father was also gone till one
                                    o'clock, where I know not except that he helped Kivett sirup down. Bill
                                    Hand came in the afternoon and got the rest of the meal ground a week ago yesterday.
                                    I staid around and wished for less snow.
                        Saturday, April 2nd
                        John Kivett and Bob Foster came early to send to town, and to get tools to freshen
                                    the sugar-trees with. The day began clear but soon got cloudy and was cold
                                    chillingly so. About dark it began to snow. Father and I went to town in the hack,
                                    starting about ten o'clock. I went to Kennedy80 to see
                                    about getting my two old teeth pulled. He prodded them and poked them but I
                                    could'n't get my mouth open wide enough for comfort so I deferred
                                    it till a more convenient season. We got home about four o'clock. Alvin
                                    chored around visited the camp awhile, as also did Pap for a little while after
                                    supper.
                        Sunday, April 3rd.
                        "Still Winter lingers in the lap of Spring."81

                                    disappeared when it struck Mother Earth however. For lack of anything better to do
                                    or go to I went over to the creek church where there was to be a reorganization of
                                    the "Lord's Day School" as the brethren insist upon
                                    calling it. About thirty were present all youngsters but two. Adjourned for two

                                     more. Nothing religious done except taking up a
                                    collection which was small. Foster and Kivett boiled down their two barrels of sap
                                    and got three more this evening. Dan Bain and Say Kivett boiled a good part of their
                                    syrup down into sugar having brought the kettle from Foster's. Mr Wm
                                    Warthen was here about noon getting Father to write petition for the building of a
                                    new school-house this district. I went down to Wat's a horseback about four
                                    o clock and got my pay for serving a[s] clerk of election last March 14th. It
                                    amounted to a check for $2.00 and exemption from two days work on the
                                    road. I got home a little after dark after having a long gas with Os. Alvin was up
                                    at the camp a short time in the evening and Father a short time in the forenoon
                                    which was about the extent of their journeyings. The first chickens for 1881 are

                        It only snowed in short squalls, few and far between but masses of heavy dark clouds
                                    floated over and a north wind made the air raw and cold. We
                                    did'n't do much of anything this forenoon. More or less of the
                                    time we spent at the sugar-camp. Alvin made a tour of inspection to view the fence
                                    around Jake's Foster 40. After dinner he and Father went and partly worked
                                    up the oak tree cut down March 23rd riving it into a sort of plank for fencing 14
                                    feet long. John Kivett and Foster stirred off again about noon and got about two
                                    barrels this evening. They had visitors Donald Bain Sr82 and
                                    Bill Hand besides the inevitable ones. I spent the afternoon whacking wood and
                                    sitting in the house.

                        Another partially cloudy day with north wind and raw chilly air. Alvin and I spent
                                    the forenoon sawing poplar stovewood on the Upper 80.83 It was
                                    hard work as the logs were almost too big for the saw In the afternoon we hauled the
                                    wood to the house and sawed one of the logs in two once more

                                             on March 17, 1809. He immigrated first to 
                                                Maryland
                                            , then moved to Jefferson Township in 1843. By 1880 he was a
                                            highly respected farmer. He died in 1896. Blanchard, Counties

                                     and split it up with Father's help or
                                    rather he split it up with a little help from Alvin. We had two sled loads of poplar
                                    wood of a tolerably good quality as a result of the day's work. Father
                                    worked up some more of his oak tree, and spent some time where Foster and Hand were
                                    at work I believe. A tree-peddler visited these haunts today, but for a wonder was
                                    easily bluffed off. Kivett siruped off alone before noon and
                                    did'n't get any sap this evening. He had one visitor, Bill
                                    Dezearn. John Foster was here to borrow corn-meal but did'n't get
                                    any and Bob brought some corn down to be taken to town tomorrow
                        Wednesday, April 6th.
                        A good freeze last night and a sun-shiny though rather raw day. Father took 8 bushels
                                    of his own corn and the two bushels Bob brought last night and went to town to mill.
                                    He was'n't back home till five o'clock. I helped Foster
                                    and Hand at the wood this forenoon. Sayroy Kivett was there also. He was with them
                                    yesterday too. In the afternoon I went up to the camp after noon and spent some time
                                    both with Bill Dezearn and John Kivett. Came back and helped Alvin make some poplar
                                    stovewood. John got about four barrels of sap to-day. Mother and Alvin did the
                                    week's washing. Sayroy and Bob were here awhile after dark in the evening.
                                    Our first chickens hatched in 1881 are 3 in number. The bees are all dead and to-day
                                    honey to the amount of 25 or 30 lbs. was taken out of the hive.
                        Thursday April 7th.
                        It froze last night, but got a good deal warmer, and between 2 and 3 o'clock
                                    it began to rain. It didn't stop either when night came. Father went over
                                    the creek to see how the wood was progressing. The three that worked yesterday were
                                    at work nearly all day. He came back and worked up some more of that oak tree into
                                    fence-slats. Alvin filed the cross-cut saw and I split stovewood till nearly eleven
                                    o'clock when we went up on the upper 80 got a sled-load of the top of the
                                    oak tree before mentioned. I brought it home, and Alvin helped Pap till noon. After
                                    dinner, we went and got a sled load of poplar for stovewood and the rain then called
                                    a halt. Father however was not at home till nearly night. Bill Hand came after five
                                    o clock and got 22 lbs of "sow-belly." Kivett had a big stir-off
                                    today and a glorious run of sap.
                        
                        Friday, April 8th.
                        It rained till towards noon after which time it only drizzled occasionally. Kivett
                                    and Bob Foster were in the sap business to-day. Kivett stirred off about noon. The
                                    kettle had been brought from Foster's and about a gallon of syrup was made
                                    into wax and sugar of which Father and I, Jap and Bob Foster John Kivett and Bill
                                    Hand all partook and had plenty. I went up there early to pass away the time, Father
                                    went later. Alvin spent the greater part of the day making the hinge-post for a
                                    gate. After dinner Father went up and finished making his fence lumber. Jap Foster
                                    was sent down to borrow the hogringers and get me to fetch the old dog up there. He
                                    was already there but I took him to the side of a hill at some distance from the
                                    boiling place, where Sayroy Kivett and three other fellows were with rifles. At
                                    about two rods distance Sayroy put a rifle bullet through the old dog's
                                    head almost exactly in the center of his forehead. He never knew what hurt him but
                                    throwing all four feet together, turned a somersault and expired. Foster was to have
                                    all the sap after Kivett's stirring off. He got nearly four barrels and
                                    when he hauled them in brought in the buckets also and piled them near the boiling
                                    place. The visitor besides myself and Kivett was Dan Bain. Foster stirred off at
                                    night and had nearly the same crowd I guess.
                        Obituary.
                        Bose was born in the summer of 1871 at the residence of V. T. (commonly called Jake)
                                    Harrison. He has been with this family since September of that year. His virtues
                                    were rather negative than positive. He had but little training, and therefore was of
                                    little use comparatively speaking, but he did as little harm as any dog that ever
                                    lived his number of years as he had almost no bad habits whatever
                        Saturday, April 9th.
                        To-day was cloudy and chilly but considerably warmer than for a few days back. Alvin
                                    went up to the sugar camp immediately after breakfast and heating some water
                                    proceeded to scald out the buckets and other things I staid around home helping Pap
                                    get started etc. He went about nine o clock in the hack and I went up and helped
                                    Alvin. We finished before noon, then went up and buried our old dog near where he
                                    fell. After noon we made poplar stovewood and put it in the  woodhouse till night. Father got home about five
                                    o'clock John Bain came with him and drove home a sow of his that has been
                                    staying here for some time past. John Foster for some reason came after hog rings
                                    about six o'clock.
                        Sunday, April 10th.
                        It was a day of sunshine and about 60 degrees of warmth, with threatening clouds
                                    Nobody but Alvin went far off the place this forenoon: he took a jook somewhere in
                                    the direction of Fowler's. After dinner I went up to Crone's
                                    a-horseback. A tolerable sized crowd listened with patience to sermon from Mr. Moore
                                    of which being a late arrival I did not hear the text, and could only guess at the
                                    subject. I went down to Wat's and Bain's awhile before coming
                                    home.
                        Monday April 1111th.
                        A day of puttering around. It threatened rain all the forenoon and did rain in
                                    occasional showers during the afternoon. Father spent the time till ten
                                    o'clock where Foster and Hand were at work at the wood. Alvin and I hauled
                                    in the buckets and other utensils from the sugar camp leaving Fowler's
                                    buckets up there. I then went again and got the log-sled Father came back and cut a
                                    gate post from the top of the oak tree which he has been working up into fence
                                    "lumber." I went down with the wagon to where we piled a few rails
                                    March 18th. and hauling them down, rebuilt with them that end of the levee fence
                                    which we took to build part of the road fence. After this I went up and got the gate
                                    post. The rain after dinner hindered work. Father and Alvin made a gate or rather
                                    put one together, Mother and Alvin performed the usual cleansing of dirty duds for
                                    the week.
                        Tuesday April 12th.
                        Foster and Hand finished the schoolhouse contract of wood yesterday and to-day
                                    entered upon a contract to cut 6 cords for W. W. Kennedy There was a thunder-storm
                                    and a hard rain last night. The creek was bank full the morning, and Father
                                    did'n't get over to where they were at work till nearly night when
                                    he rode over. He tried to this morning and couldn't. Alvin and I spent most
                                    of the forenoone sawing up the trees he cut, up above the orchard for the new
                                    "tater patch. Bill Dezearn was here a little while about noon and I was
                                    with him a short time where he was grubbing. Father and Alvin this
                                    afternoon hung their new gate between the ice-house and the cow-barn  and put a panel of plank fence there besides. Our horse
                                    Dave or Hemp being loose in the yard before the house broke the dashboard off the
                                    hack which was standing there and demolished one of the forewheels by getting fast
                                    in it some way. The hay is all out of the horse stable and there is about one
                                    day's feed of fodder left. Cloudy all day with a little rain just at night
                        Wednesday, April 13th
                        To-day the sky was clouded and no sun was seen. There was a slight snow storm in the
                                    evening and the air was rather raw and chilly. Alvin painted the sap buckets, which
                                    had been put in the shop last Monday. He painted them red on the outside. Father and
                                    I hauled manure from around the stable door and in the stalls. That from in the
                                    stable we made a hot-bed of in the usual place in the corner of the garden: the rest
                                    we hauled on the field immediately below the garden. It was very slushy nasty work.
                                    It was hauled on the sled and hoed off it. Foster and Hand entirely finished up the
                                    wood this forenoon and Bill came and settled with Pap about two o'clock.
                                    There are $3.50 due him I had a slight gas with Wat who passed through
                                    about night going home. To-day was my 26th. birthday.
                        Thursday April 14th
                        There was a pretty hard freeze last night. The sun shone in mostly a clear sky to-day
                                    but clouds denoting rain soon, came up in the evening. Father and Alvin sawed a cut
                                    off an oak log down in the pasture and Father split it into fence-posts. Alvin
                                    hauled wood down to the wood-pile through the "orchard" from his
                                    prospective "‘tater patch" on the sled I helping him We
                                    quit that at ten o'clock; hitched to the wagon, put 17 baskets full of corn
                                    in it and went to Jake's, by the way of Dan Kirk's. We had no
                                    accidents and got home again before one o'clock but it was very hard on the
                                    horse. After dinner Father disappeared till nearly five o'clock. Alvin and
                                    I finished hauling wood, rails, etc. from the prospective
                                    "tater-patch" and Alvin spent the time till night in an only
                                    partly successful attempt to burn a pile of green brush. Father and I took the sled
                                    and scraper; went down to the big road gate and scraped sand into a hole that the
                                    creek had washed under the gate. Mr Leander Lewis was here to see Pap about
                                    something about three o'clock but of course did not find him. Bob Foster
                                    came this afternoon and got the old musket and accoutrements to go duck-hunting with
                                    on the morrow.
                        
                        Friday, April 15th
                        To-day was cloudy with raw northwest wind and fine drizzling rain in the middle of
                                    the day for two or three hours. Father was gone all day to town, to attend a meeting
                                    of the Township Assessors in the Auditor's office I presume. Alvin was gone
                                    all day with the cross-cut saw. He was helping Jake in a small clearing, which our
                                    worthy uncle has under way. I put in my time in finishing up the clearing, burning,
                                    etc. which Alvin began yesterday. Thanks to the high wind I was successful. John
                                    Kivett was here in the forenoon and put a handle on his pitch-fork. He also took
                                    away the "tater-digger." The absent members of the family returned
                                    about five o'clock. The grass is beginning to show a slight greenness and
                                    the buds on the trees are a little bit larger. But Spring seems to be stalled
                                    somewhere with a heavy load of winter weather. Father was up at Foster's
                                    awhile after supper.
                        Saturday April 16th.
                        A freeze again last night, and a sun-shiny though partly cloudy, spring-like day with
                                    however a perceptible rawness of air. Father and I spent most of the day in town. We
                                    went in the big wagon and took the skeleton of the old hack and the rims of the
                                    wheels having knocked the spokes out. We had six in the wagon in all when we came
                                    out of town, six passengers I mean including us. Alvin tinkered around at various
                                    chores. Bill Hand came and got his last meal on the wood contract; this evening
                        Sunday April 17th.
                        Easter. A slight frost last night followed by a day of thin clouds and hot air, in
                                    fact the first spring day. Lamb's Creek Sunday School was organized to-day
                                    with enough of fun to nearly seem a riotous burlesque. Riley Nosier for

                                    more or less opposition. After dinner I went up to John Fowler's new old
                                    residence but as I feared, found "nobody to hum." I went on

                                     over to Dilly's mill and still further
                                    on to Stoke R. T. Stiles where I staid till night and then came home. The rest of
                                    the household did nothing noteworthy I believe except that Alvin jooked once to
                                    outside regions vaguely known as "down the creek." I saw to-day
                                    James Gray of Eminence, a Normalite of days gone by at Martinsville.
                        Monday, April 18th.
                        Same weather to a great extent as yesterday Clouds thicker and threatened rain at
                                    night. Father departed soon after breakfast to the city of Martinsville on business
                                    I believe connected with the tax assessing. I plowed the potato-patch which had been
                                    cleared above the orchard. Alvin helped a good deal by turning over refractory sod
                                    etc. It was a hard job on team and driver but was done by eleven o'clock.
                                    After dinner I harrowed it and furrowed it out. Father came home before I had
                                    finished furrowing and covered most of the potatoes, which Alvin dropped. Mother and
                                    Alvin as usual cleansed the more or less dirty habiliments etc. of the household.
                                    Mrs. Nancy Ballinger was here after, and got, some buttermilk. The woods begin to
                                    darken with buds, frogs peep in plenty, and a whippor-will, was said to have been
                                    heard last night. Changing the subject I will mention that we planted entirely Early
                                    Rose potatoes to day.
                        Tuesday, April 19th
                        It did'n't rain. But yesterday's and to-day's
                                    weather were as much alike as two peas, except that it was clearer. We had plenty of
                                    callers. First came Jap Foster and borrowed the iron wedge. Father departed on the
                                    black hoss for the "Bottoms" but met Mr. Isenhower86 coming to him. They came here, staid till after dinner and went away
                                    again, Pap afoot. Alvin and I went up and enlarged the potato patch in the calf and
                                    hog pasture by moving out a big tree top which had to be sawed up and a big pile of
                                    logs and limbs big and little, made of it. After clearing it, I plowed harrowed and
                                    furrowed it. The plowing was not as hard work as on yesterday's patch and
                                    it harrowed up nicely. We had to haul rails and fence our enlargment which did not
                                    leave us time to plant. John Kivett came towards night and got some of his fruit
                                    cans Shortly afterwards came Aleck Benge, and one of Meter Benge's boys;
                                    the first after both sweet and 
                              
                                 86 Probably David Isenhower, forty-four, a Jefferson
                                            Township farmer. Ibid., 179.
                           
                                     sour [milk], the second after potatoes of which
                                    I believe he got a few. Father got some sweet potatoes brought from town but the
                                    hot-bed was too hot to put them in.
                        Wednesday, April 20th.
                        The sky continued either hazy or cloudy and the air warm and spring-like. Alvin and I
                                    planted the patch we fixed yesterday, with Early Rose potatoes. (It was planted a
                                    year ago to-day.) We then hitched to the sled and hauled manure. First we cleaned
                                    out the buggy-shed, and that done we hauled away the cow-manure. The stuff was half
                                    liquid and mixed with corn-stalks, which made it a bothersome and nasty job. Part of
                                    it we put on the field south of Bill Hands wheat and part on the field immediately
                                    below the house. Father was gone all day on the assessment business.
                        Thursday April 21st
                        It was more or less cloudy till eleven o'clock. From that time till four
                                    o'clock it sprinkled occasionally. The rain kept steadily coming down from
                                    four till night but not in very great quantity. Jap and John Foster brought home the
                                    iron wedge this morning, also the old musket and all the accoutrements except the
                                    cap-box. Alvin and I hauled manure till the rain drove us in. We finished on the
                                    cow-dung mixture just before noon putting it immediately below the house on the
                                    corn-field from whence came smells not exactly like those "wafted by the
                                    spice-laden breezes of Araby the Blest."87 After dinner
                                    having hoisted the bed off the wagon we went at the horse-manure. We put that on the last ground sowed to grass-seed to make the seed
                                    sprout if possible, which the greatest part of it has hitherto failed to do. While
                                    we were down there we got a load of gravel from the creek and put in the buggy-shed.
                                    Two loads of manure and two of gravel were hauled before the rain compelled us to
                                    stop. Father was gone all day on the assessment business.
                        Friday, April 22nd.
                        And he was gone on the same business also to-day "from morn till
                                    eve." It was a warm day with almost clear sky. Hauling manure was still the

                        Saturday, April 23rd
                        The fairest and hottest day yet. Father went to town or started there soon after
                                    breakfast and made his return trip so as to get here between five and six
                                    o'clock. He brought a load of sawdust to put in the ice-house, and among
                                    other things two small cedar trees, which were immediately set out, one on each side
                                    of the one already growing in front of the house. I devoted almost the entire day to
                                    cleaning up the yard, picking up chunks, raking chips etc. Alvin fixed some of the
                                    fence around Jake's Foster 40, getting back home before noon. He was up at
                                    Jake's house during his tour. After he got home he partly cleaned off the
                                    garden and assisted me some little. Aleck Benge was here about five o'clock
                                    to get some milk, both sweet and sour.
                        Sunday, April 24th
                        The day was very hot, and during the afternoon it rained a pretty hard shower and
                                    thundered some. I attended Sunday School on the creek in the forenoon but got there
                                    too late to take any part. I also took a jook up to Foster's and
                                    Kivett's but came home again before dark. Father took a journey to
                                    Foster's this forenoon to get his hair cut, but Foster
                                    was'n't at home. "The rest of us" did as I
                                    should have done, staid quietly at home
                        Monday, April 25th.
                        It was showery in the morning and in the evening and rained considerably here both
                                    times. It quit before eight o'clock this morning and Father meandered off
                                    on the assessing business again. W. Riley Nosier came and bought 9 pounds of clover
                                    seed for 90 cents and borrowed an inch chisel. I went a-horseback down to
                                    Bain's; took them a couple of messes of Peach Blow potatoes as a present
                                    and got some yeast. After dinner I went to plowing the buckwheat ground for oats. It
                                    was very hot. Father got home about five o'clock and sowed part of his oats
                                    (bought in town last Saturday) on the ground already  plowed. We were both driven in by a shower and quit for
                                    the night. That job came near being too much for me.
                        Tuesday, April 26th
                        It was cloudy more or less all day and it lacked a little of being
                                    as hot as it was yesterday. I finished plowing the land I began yesterday, and
                                    Father sowed the remainder of his oats which did not sow much more than half of the
                                    ground plowed. Father then departed on the assessing journey again, while I went
                                    a-horseback out to Mr. Obadiah Ratts's88 to deliver a
                                    note of Pap's relative to some business in which they were both concerned.
                                    I got home before one by our clock and found Alvin and Mother washing. I
                                    accidentally found Dan Bain and Bill Dezearn at work and spent about an hour with
                                    them. Afterward Alvin and I hauled two wagon-loads of the wood Bill Bunton made last
                                    fall across the creek, and put it in the wood house. I then went to harrowing in the
                                    oats and it took me till eight o clock
                        Wednesday, April 27th.
                        Hot in the forenoon. A cooling wind from the north blew most of the afternoon and
                                    threatening clouds passed over with a few drops of rain. It
                                    was'n't much cooler at night There was nothing of much importance
                                    done here. I spent most of the forenoon and part of the afternoon in clearing the
                                    creek end of the field south of Hand's wheat. Picked up the chunks that the
                                    overflow of the creek had deposited there, and burnt them. I also took out a few
                                    "grubs." During the afternoon I mended at the
                                    garden-fence Alvin fixed some woodwork for a new harrow and squizzed the remainder
                                    of the day, putting a new footpower to his combination lathe and saw mill. Father
                                    went a-horse-back to town this morning and got back at 4.30 o clock. He did some
                                    assessing on the road. Aleck Benge came a- beast-back and got some potatoes both
                                    late and early, a peck of each kind.
                        Thursday, April 28th.
                        There was a threatening sky most of the time and thunder showers were around but it
                                    only rained a little here about noon. Bill Hand came and after grinding his hoe,
                                    went to cutting the stalks in his wheat The eleven o'clock shower 
                              
                                 88 Obadiah Ratts, fifty-eight, was an Ashland Township
                                            farmer. U.S., Tenth Census, 1880, population schedules for

                                     caused a disappearance of him, I suppose, for
                                    he was not seen by any of us after that time. Father rode off on the same errand as
                                    usual, and was gone all day. Alvin went to Jake's a short time this morning
                                    got some apple-tree grafts and spent the time till noon grafting them into various
                                    trees around. After dinner, he took Hemp the hoss and riding down to the
                                    "Kirk house" got some more grafts. Coming home he grafted them
                                    also. I hauled up the old harrow and burnt it up on a pile of the chips raked last
                                    Saturday. I passed most of the day grubbing where Aleck Benge had corn last year.
                                    Besides I spent two or three hours trying to raise the water gates down at the road
                                    in the big creek with only partial success.
                        Friday April 29th
                        This was a pleasantly cool day with but a few clouds in the sky and a N.W. wind.
                                    Father was gone all day to a region named Joe Bradley's, a few miles up the
                                    creek. He went professedly to take a hand in the division of the estate and took one
                                    of the horses with him. I finished the Benge patch before noon and during the
                                    afternoon was employed at various small jobs such as helping to clear the garden
                                    helping to cut down and remove the debris of one of the mulberry trees that grew at
                                    the end of the house etc. Alvin was employed at jobs if anything still smaller. Bill
                                    Hand reappeared in his wheat-field this afternoon. John Bain came and bought a half
                                    bushel of Early Rose potatoes to plant
                        Saturday, April 30th
                        Another cool day with considerable clouds. Father and I started to town about nine o
                                    clock in the wagon taking eggs, butter, five sacksfull of corn, some (all of the)
                                    harrow teeth, and Tenie Dezearn's basket of butter besides. I made no
                                    purchases and got nothing except that I got tired. Father bought things too numerous
                                    to mention individually here. We got home some little after five o'clock.
                                    While we were gone Alvin and Mother took almost every article of furniture out of
                                    the fireplace room and went to scraping off the whitewash They
                                    did'n't get nearly done and apparently will not for a week. After
                                    we came home Father and Alvin burnt the harrow teeth into the new wood-work. The new
                                    harrow is to be a foot longer than the old one
                        
                        Sunday, May 1st.
                        It began raining at about seven o'clock in showers and kept at it till
                                    towards night and still continued threatening. No one of us got far from the house
                                    till evening when we three men each took a "jook." Alvin was gone
                                    up on Jake's Foster 40; I went down to the road. John Fowler and his father
                                    were looking at his wheat prospect and I passed a little while with them.
                                    Subsequently John found Father and they also canvassed the subject of wheat. Father
                                    had gone up the creek. I wrote part of a letter to Grandmother One of my teeth hurt
                                    most of the forenoon.
                        Monday, May 2nd
                        It rained nearly all the time in varying quantity from shower to drizzle from early
                                    morn dewy eve. Father put the harrow together—wrong which was perhaps
                                    owing to the presence of John Kivett and Bill Hand who were here this morning. I
                                    know not on what business. They left about 9 o'clock, Father going with
                                    them on the assessment errand. Alvin and I put the harrow together as we thought it
                                    should be; and spent a good part of the time to scraping off the whitewash in the
                                    fireplace room, a very hard, tedious; strength requiring task. Aleck Benge made
                                    another call after both sweet and sour milk; this afternoon
                        Tuesday, May 3rd
                        A cool partly cloudy day again. Father again tackled the harrow and after some
                                    changing around got it to suit him. We put it on a small patch just below the
                                    garden. After harrowing the stalks down I plowed it. That portion next the
                                    cow-stable was hard and made big clods but the new implement scratched the clods
                                    mostly out of existence at least on top. It was noon when I got that patch done.
                                    After dinner assisted by Alvin I plowed and harrowed the garden. The plow
                                    would'n't scour any better than it used to but the ground broke up
                                    generally very mellow. That done I made twenty-two hills without putting any
                                    "fertilizers" in them and planted in them some watermelon seeds. I
                                    made the hills about three inches high. Mother and Alvin cleansed the habilments of
                                    the household and Alvin scraped manfully at his whitewash job Wat was here a moment
                                    this forenoon on business.
                        
                        Thursday [sic], May 4th
                        This was a business day here. Bill Hand came and finished cutting his corn-stubs
                                    leaving the tall stalks for me to cut sometime with the stalk cutter. Father and I
                                    went over to Fowler's and got the stalk-cutter. I cut till about ten
                                    o'clock on the stalks south of Hand's wheat; and the crooked
                                    field. Meanwhile John Fowler and Oily Hinson came and went to work picking the
                                    chunks off John's wheat. They got that done about ten o'clock and
                                    John then ran the stalk-cutter till night. I began plowing a land which included the
                                    "crooked patch." Mr. J.J. Hinson was here most of the forenoon
                                    counseling, and advising John, and picking himself out a barrel of seed corn at our
                                    crib. The clouds thickened up and it rained in small showers till about four o clock
                                    and it was after that time when I got to plowing again. Father did not get started
                                    on his tour till ten o'clock and after. Alvin was occupied the greater part
                                    of the time at his scratching job. Aleck and a small Benge whose cognomination is
                                    unknown to me came in the evening; Aleck after his usual portion of milk.
                        Thursday, May 5th
                        It rained two or three hard showers in the forenoon and drizzled more or less till
                                    two or three o'clock. Father got started pretty early. Alvin scratched all
                                    day and about all that he was able. I helped him a little—not much. I
                                    wandered around considerably; made another unsuccessful attempt to raise the
                                    water-gate in the creek spent a little while with Bill Dezearn who was plowing his
                                    patch above, and as a general thing I did'n't do much of anything
                        Friday, May 6th
                        A very hot day. A heavy fog hung over till perhaps nine o'clock, then the
                                    sun came out and though masses of heavy clouds floated over it made no abatement of
                                    the heat. I finished the plowing the land begun Wednesday; got the stalk-cutter and
                                    mangled the stalks on the Benge patch, then plowed that and finally took the plow up
                                    into the N.W. corner of Hand's wheat field and plowed up a small patch for
                                    sweet potatoes. At night I was too hot and my head felt too bad to eat any supper. I
                                    drank a cup of coffee and vomited it again. Alvin scratched till five
                                    o'clock when he called it done and rejoiced in spirit thereat. Father went
                                    afoot to town this morning. John F. commenced breaking up his field on the side next
                                    the road. His father sent for and got the stalk-cutter again this afternoon. I  finished and sent my letter to Grandmother this
                                    morning and we received one from her this evening. She writes that she is in poor
                                    health, dizzy-headed and has a bad cold. She lives almost alone now. Mr. Silas R.
                                    Sulye who married her sister Elizabeth died a few days ago aged nearly 80. He lived
                                    at Galena, [
                                        Ohio
                                    ], and willed be missed by those who knew him.
                        I have forgotten to state that Jap Foster came yesterday morning and borrowed the
                                    fro.
                        Saturday, May 7th
                        The weather was a great deal like that of yesterday without the fog. I rested from my
                                    labors during the greater part of the day. Father and Alvin went to town tolerably
                                    early and got back about four o'clock. They brought the skeleton of the old
                                    hack. It has new wheels, two springs behind, new spindles but not much new paint on
                                    it. They also brought some "stone ochre" paint to put on the walls
                                    of the fireplace room and some "drop black" to be used in painting
                                    the hack I suppose. John finished cutting stalks and plowed a good deal besides. I
                                    spent the time while the rest were gone mostly with him and in running around with
                                    Sayroy Kivett who was hunting squirrels. In the evening I hitched to the
                                    stalk-cutter and cut the stalks in Bill Hand's wheat and a few in the field
                                    below it. The hot weather is spreading greenness very fast.
                        Sunday, May 8th
                        Very warm. Thunder showers around but a very small amount of rain here. I made out to
                                    go to the creek church, where "Lord's Day School" was
                                    attended by a, for that place fair-sized crowd. Services devoid of much
                                    "intensity" I hoofed it down to Wat's and Bain's
                                    for awhile in the evening, had a little fun and got home about 9 o'clock.
                                    Father went up to Foster's and vicinity after dinner. "The rest of
                                    us" did'n't do any noteworthy deeds.
                        Monday, May 9th.
                        Before breakfast came Hemp Lewis and about ten o'clock he departed again
                                    with a bushel of seed corn. I plowed all the forenoon on the east side of the field
                                    south of Hand's wheat and cut stalk till 4.30 o'clock on the west
                                    side of it. Father departed on the assessment errand shortly after Lewis left. Alvin
                                    painted the hack-skeleton the first time; worked in the garden and chored around
                                    occasionally It was very warm but the clouds afforded some respite from the
                                    sun's heat. It sprinkled  rain once in
                                    a while till 4.30 o'clock when a hard dashing shower came up and I
                                    did'n't work any more in the field. Bill Hand came after the rain
                                    to get some "Bloody Butcher" seed corn but
                                    could'n't find much. Bob Foster boys brought the fro home about
                                    the same time. John F. did'n't work in his contract to-day. Pap
                                    got to town before he came home Bill H. took away the corn drill.
                        Tuesday, May 10th.
                        It rained pretty hard for awhile between four and five o'clock in the
                                    morning but did not give us any more. Before nine o'clock I went to plowing
                                    again where I quit yesterday. Plowed till noon when I finished that
                                    "land." After dinner I finished cutting stalks on this side of the
                                    creek and began plowing a land in the same field on the side next to
                                    Fowler's Mr. Daniel Kirk89 spent most of the forenoon
                                    picking out half a bushel of seed corn from our crib. He was very particular. Father
                                    staid at home or not far from it all day and was occupied in painting and otherwise
                                    fixing the hack most of the time. Alvin helped him and also helped Mother wash. The
                                    "trial survey" for a new railroad from Martinsville to 
                                        Terre Haute
                                     passed through here to-day.90 Their line of stakes
                                    cut the clover patch in two about the middle, crosses the creek a few feet below the
                                    ford and goes some distance south of the middle of John's field. The
                                    surveyors have been in the neighborhood for three or four days. John plowed.
                        Wednesday, May 11th.
                        I plowed all day on the "land" begun yesterday. (My day's
                                    work generally last 8 or 9 hours.) It was still very warm and at noon the
                                    thermometer said 88° in the shade. The fat horses sweat and puffed
                                    profusely. Father drove the old Curtis sow, which has been fattening ever since she
                                    ate her pigs. She weighed 440 lbs. and for $4.50 per cwt. It was sundown
                                    when Pap got back. Alvin was busy at one thing or another all day. John Fowler
                                    finished plowing in his field to-day. I was down there a few minutes and also a
                                    little while where the senior and junior Donald Bains were trying to haul logs. The
                                    wind blew in refreshing breezes from the south, big clouds floated 
                              
                                 89 Daniel Kirk, fifty-one, was a Jefferson Township

                                     over but still it was very warm. A Benge was
                                    here again after his milk or milks perhaps it would be more proper to say.
                        Thursday, May 12th
                        Still warmer. The same kind of weather, breezes, clouds etc., but the heat
                                    intensified I finished my "land" by ten o'clock and began
                                    on the one between the two already broken, which I plowed till night. Father was
                                    around all day Alvin and he fixed the water-fence across the creek down at the road
                                    which I hope will keep the roaming swine out. He also fixed the small water gate
                                    across the little creek on Fowler's line, and chored around at various
                                    things. Alvin was occupied a good part of his time in making screen frames for the
                                    windows. John F. and his father-in-law were in his contract all day harrowing and
                                    furrowing off. They were up at the house a short time in the evening—on
                                    what business I have not yet found out. The melon seeds are up and on them by the
                                    dozen are the striped bugs John and his father in-law I have omitted to write, began
                                    planting about four o clock in John's field
                        Friday, May 13th.
                        John and Oily planted all day and must have got nearly, if not quite done. I finished
                                    plowing the last "land" in the field below Hand's wheat
                                    about 9.30 o'clock. I hitched to the harrow and scratched; firstly the
                                    patch plowed May 3rd; secondly; the crooked field; thirdly; "Aleck
                                    Benge's patch" and lastly commenced on the side next to Fowler of
                                    the field I had been plowing in last. Father went in various directions and did
                                    various things, the most important of which was to go and get A. Benge to plant corn
                                    tomorrow, for us. He started after another horse but did'n't get
                                    farther than Fowler's, he piled chunks in the "clover
                                    patch" and burned them, he mended fence, he and Alvin set out a lot of
                                    sweet potato plants 250 or so in number, in the patch broken last Friday, and Alvin
                                    and he fooled some more with the hack. Alvin was also employed in the screen
                                    business. It was large warm (92° in the shade) with few clouds. Those
                                    roaming swine did get in again but where no one knows certainly
                        Saturday, May 14th.
                        But we found out this morning that they got in under the plank just across the big
                                    creek. Alvin and I went to R. J. Foster's with the wagon after the
                                    corn-drill. Aleck was promptly on hand with his old beast. He planted the patch  where he had corn last year and the crooked
                                    field then went home for dinner. Father and I went to town in the hack the old
                                    "bed" on the new "skeleton." The rather fresh
                                    paint got pretty well sanded. Pap purchased paint to put on the fireplace room,
                                    (stone ochre taking too long to dry) besides some other things We were back home by
                                    one o'clock. It had been very warm up to that time and a storm gathered in
                                    the north and west. There was a good deal of wind and some thunder but only a small
                                    (comparatively) fall of rain took place here. Aleck was around but only got to plant
                                    a few rows. Visitors; Jap Foster after his father's mail and Mr. Henry
                                    Fowler after some lime which we had brought out for him from town. Short visits both
                                    made.
                        Sunday, May 15th.
                        There was a fall of 34° in the temperature between yesterday noon and this
                                    morning and all day a cool wind blew and blew hard. The thermometer indicated
                                    92° at 12 o clock yesterday. Wat came up to salt his cattle and I was
                                    with him for awhile, so long that I only got to "Lord's Day
                                    School" in time to see the collection taken up etc. There was the usual
                                    Social after L.D.S. Alvin went to Jake's but got back by three
                                    o'clock. About two Pap departed into the city of Ballingertown and was gone
                                    till sundown. Uncle Rip, Aunt Mary and Virgy came up in their carriage, shortly
                                    after Alvin got back. An excursion into the regions of the upper 80 was immediately
                                    taken by all of us the men walking the rest in the carriage. Father got home about
                                    sundown and after milking it was decided that the cow whose name is
                                    "Sheep" should go a visiting I was a horseback; he afoot It took
                                    considerable racing before we got them into the road and more afterward but I
                                    finally got to Wat's with them a good deal in advance of Pap. Got them back
                                    home without very much trouble.
                        Monday, May 16th.
                        A nearly clear almost uncomfortably cool day. I harrowed in the field below
                                    Hand's wheat finishing it about three o'clock, then scratched down
                                    some burs weeds etc. on a patch just on the house side of the oats. From 4.30 o
                                    clock till night I plowed on a land joining to, and below the one plowed May 3rd.
                                    Father and Alvin were occupied in painting the fireplace room the greater part of
                                    the day. Those roaming swine of Bed. O'Neal's were in again this
                                    morning. Bill Dezearn came and got the  harrow
                                    after I began plowing. Alice and John Foster were here a short time in the evening
                                    and got some sweet potato plants I felt rather under the weather for awhile at night
                                    but not seriously so. The old cow, Peg, has a rather small nearly white heifer calf.
                        Tuesday, May 17th.
                        The same kind of weather as yesterday but a little warmer. Father departed to do some
                                    more assessing and was gone nearly all day. Bill Hand was early on the scene and
                                    taking Dave put double lines on him and went to laying off in the field south of his
                                    wheat. It was considerable trouble and he finally took Dave into Foster's
                                    and swapped him for Bob's old roan horse Jim, for the day's work.
                                    I drilled with old Colonel. We were till 4 o'clock finishing that field,
                                    then we planted the patch immediately below the garden, and yard, (it was plowed May
                                    3rd) after which Bill plowed on the land I began yesterday till nearly sundown, when
                                    he took the drill up to Foster's. I went with him and got Dave. Alvin
                                    painted all the blessed day, one thing and another. We had only one visitor at the
                                    house; Aleck Benge after his milk supply, but several more running about the place
                                    etc.
                        Wednesday, May 18th.
                        Weather still the same, no warmer but more clouds. The head of the house departed
                                    once more and was gone all day assessing. He struck town before he got back home. I
                                    finished the land begun Monday, about 9.30 o'clock and went to back
                                    furrowing one below it. At noon made Bill Dezearn bring the harrow home, and I
                                    harrowed the land I had finished in the morning after which I plowed till night.
                                    Bill took the harrow off again the minute I was done and also borrowed the single-
                                    shovel plow, and open ring Alvin painted, varnished squizzed and helped Mother wash.
                                    Father brought home a letter from Grandmother and also one from Frona. Grandmother
                                    appears to be in good health, spirits and state of mind. Flave's are

                        Thursday, May 19th
                        Weather precisely as yesterday except that it was warmer through the day. John Dilly
                                    came soon and after some picking over got what seemed to me a half bushel of seed
                                    corn. Mr. David Bothwell92 came on the same errand about nine
                                    o'clock but, as Pap had already gone to Willis O'Neals's,
                                    he went on up to Foster's, and got his seed corn there. Father got back
                                    home between ten and eleven o'clock and went to putting down carpet in the
                                    fireplace room after which things were moved back and seemed to resume their normal
                                    condition. I finished the "land" begun
                                    yesterday, plowed a strip which was left between it and the land finished yesterday and by four o'clock had it all harrowed. Pap
                                    then went to laying off and I taking Hemp and the sled went over on
                                    Foster's place and got the drill. It was pretty hard pulling. After I got
                                    home. Alvin rode Hemp and guided him and I drilled till night in that way. John
                                    Kivett was here a little while and got four of his fruit cans in the evening
                        Friday, May 20th.
                        Weather still unchanged; thermometer indicated 87° at noon. While Father
                                    finished planting the ground he began on yesterday evening, Alvin and I plowed the
                                    two patches of Early Rose potatoes, he riding and guiding Hemp, and I trying to hold
                                    the double-shovel. The patch above the "orchard" was very tough
                                    and leathery with sod, the other one easy. Both planting and potato plowing were
                                    done by 8.30. I back furrowed a small strip of ground between the oats and the
                                    ground just planted then Father and I harrowed it and the patch that was broken for
                                    oats and not sowed. In this last mentioned the clods were very hard and we had to
                                    leave it; the other strip we planted. After dinner we carted most of the tools
                                    across the creek and between us cut the stalks on what was last year the clover-
                                    patch. Father also did some grubbing over there and I struck off a
                                    "land" and plowed a few rounds before quitting time. Father and
                                    Alvin set out another batch of sweet potato plants, making the ridges in the
                                    "Benge patch." R. J. Foster came and got the corn-drill at noon
                                    and Bill Dezearn the harrow. Bill got the old Dudley plow yesterday to lay off with
                                    when we took the single shovel away from him. Alvin has for the past two days been
                                    mainly employed about the house doing odd jobs too numerous to mention

                        Saturday, May 21st
                        It grew a little hotter to-day and there were clouds and slight indications of rain
                                    at night Rain is needed, for the roads are dry, and dusty, the ground is hard, and
                                    things have about quit growing, Father and I went to town in the hack, starting
                                    pretty early. When we got to Wat's Albert Bishop went along as passenger.
                                    Pap bought him a second-hand mattress, and "one-hoss" black walnut
                                    bedstead at Mrs. Jennie Potter's sale. He also got a little more paint, a
                                    kit of fish, and some other things. We were back before one o'clock. Nearly
                                    everything had been taken out of the big room and Alvin was doubing on the whitewash
                                    when we got home. I got to plowing across the creek about theee o'clock;
                                    finished the "land" I began yesterday and plowed some on another
                                    one. Mr. Henry Fowler got the stalk-cutter cut what he wanted to and sent it clear
                                    home at night. Bill Dezearn brought home the harrow and Dudley awhile after noon.
                                    Father was employed on miscellaneous jobs during the afternoon and Alvin finished
                                    whitewashing. Mrs. Nancy Benge came to-day after the Benge supply of milks, and also
                                    some soap or soap grease neither of which except the milk, she got.
                        Sunday, May 22nd.
                        A day in which the sun shone through a hazy veil of clouds and felt hotter than
                                    yesterday. Not much indication of rain. No one of us got off the place or far from
                                    the house till two o'clock when I went a-horseback to 
                                        Bethlehem
                                    . A pretty good sized congregation listened to Mr. Moore as he preached
                                    on the old subject of the prodigal son. Truth compels me to say that he seemed to me
                                    to handle the subject as well or better than the great Poucher did last February. I
                                    stopped at Fowler's a short time as I came home. I found Wat, Em and the
                                    children just arrived here but of course they could'n't stay long.
                        Monday, May 23rd.
                        A warm very drying day with some clouds and considerable feeble rain indications. I
                                    plowed from morning till six o'clock beginning on the last land about five.
                                    From six till night Father plowed. Alvin spent the livelong day in painting the
                                    woodwork doors etc. of the big room. Father skirmished about as overseer and general
                                    assistant of all that was going on. The Rev. Mr. Moore spent three hours or so, and
                                    ate dinner with us.  He was given an order on
                                    Cunningham, Bollinger and Phelps,93 as we paid no
                                    "quarterage" last time. Miss Diana Fowler94
                                    was also here about two o clock got some pumpkin seeds, and the whitewash brush.
                        Tuesday, May 24th.
                        A hot day (90° at noon) with streaky clouds overspreading the sky and a
                                    shower in the south at night near enough for us to hear a little thunder. There was
                                    one at greater distance last night. I and Father by turns finished plowing the field
                                    across the crick by noon and harrowed it in the afternoon. I had much the longest
                                    turns however as he only worked at it about two hours in all. The rest of the time
                                    he was skirmishing around at nothing in particular. Dan Bain came soon to inform us
                                    of hogs in John's corn, which had got away with about a half acre of it.
                                    They were fenced out. Frank Dezearn was here a goodly portion of the afternoon,
                                    gassing to Pap. He said he came to look at Hemp the hoss with an idea of buying.
                                    There was not a great deal of work at the big room to-day owing to the
                                    week's washing having to be done.

               The Chronicle of the Overbeck Pottery. By Kathleen R. Postle. (

                    : Indiana Historical Society, 1978. Pp. 109. Illustrations, notes, appendixes,
                    bibliography, index. Paperbound, $12.50.)
            Kathleen R. Postle is uniquely qualified to tell the saga of the Overbeck Pottery: she grew up as an
                    Overbeck neighbor. "I always knew the Overbecks," she tells the reader,
                    "I cannot recall when I did not visit the house casually and frequently" (p. 9).
                    This well-researched book chronicles the history and background of the Overbeck sisters (changed
                    from the German Overpeck), the creativity that ran deep in the whole family, the preparation,
                    influences, and training for establishing their pottery, their remarkable productivity,
                    publications, exhibitions, and eventual recognition, but it is also more than that. The author goes
                    on to assess the Overbecks' artistry within the larger perspective of art movements in the 
                        United States
                     in the first half of the twentieth century with an objective view of the Overbeck
                    contribution to American ceramic art.
            Paul Evans, in his introduction, remarks on the prominent role played by women in the American art
                    pottery movement. Elizabeth Overbeck once wrote that their pottery was "altogether a
                    woman's enterprise both in its origin and conception" (p. 50). Establishing a
                    pottery "was highly innovative for young women in a midwestern town in the early part of
                    this century" (p. 50). Of the six Overbeck sisters, the three most involved in the pottery
                    could scarcely have imagined the present-day nationwide popularity of pottery making for which they
                    were trail-breaking precursors. In light of the recent Oriental stoneware mystique it is interesting
                    to note that for the Overbecks there was no room for the "happy accident" of the
                    Japanese potter. They believed the potter's original concept must be followed exactly. And this is what they did.
            Some kind of genealogical chart with dates would have been helpful in keeping the sisters identified
                    in the reader's mind: Margaret, the catalyst-teacher; Hanna, the designer- watercolorist;
                    Harriet, the musician-housekeeper; Elizabeth, the ceramic technician; and Mary, the potter-painter.
            The author is keenly sympathetic to the nuances of personalities, interrelationships, and the life
                    stresses of these creative artists; sensitive, talented, reticent, but fortified with a staunch
                    integrity. "There was considerable iron in the make-up of these women, with their
                    philosophy of ascetic life, hard work, and discipline" (p. 86). "They lived unto
                    themselves, with  commitment only to themselves and their drive
                    to create" (p. 27). Postle has, in this work, clearly placed the Overbecks in the company
                    of legendary American art potters.

                    : Indiana Historical Society, 1978. Pp. vii, 126. Notes, illustrations. Paperbound,
                    $3.00.)
            Compared to most American bicentennial symposia, the 1978 Indiana Symposium was outstanding. It
                    attracted a distinguished slate of scholars who offered fresh insights and interpretations on the
                    prosaic subject of public land history in the new nation. The result is this slim but valuable
                    addition to the literature of midwestern frontier history. The five panelists were Hildegard Binder
                    Johnson, the leading landscape geographer in America; Paul W. Gates, the nestor of land historians;
                    frontier specialist and ethnohistorian, Dwight C. Smith; and two younger institutional scholars of
                    the Old Northwest, Malcom Rohrbough, an expert on the General Land Office, and Reginald Horsman, a
                    long-time student of Indian-white relations. Although the presentations were prepared for a general
                    audience, frontier and land specialists will also find the book valuable.
            The essays are arranged from the general to the specific—from the land itself to the
                    political impact of land policy. In the opening essay, "Perceptions and Illustrations of
                    the American Landscape in the 
                        Ohio
                     Valley and the Midwest," Johnson expands on a theme developed in her recent
                    book, Order Upon the Land (1976), that modern students of the frontier can employ
                    the techinque of "visual thinking" to study pictures, maps, and even the
                    rectangular land survey patterns in order to learn how early Americans perceived their environment.
                    To buttress her thesis that pictorial evidence is a valuable complement to oral history, Johnson
                    offers some twenty-nine illustrations, including a land survey map, a county atlas, and paintings
                    and prints by George Caleb Bingham, Carl Bodmer, John James Audubon, George Henry Durrie and others.
                    Farmstead sketches in county atlases, for example, are described as " the Middle
                    West's peculiar pictorial contribution to the documentation of rural settlement,
                    line-mindedness, and pride of property" (p.33).
            
            How the farmers obtained their prideful property is Rohrbough's theme in "The Land
                    Office Business in Indiana, 1800–1840." Indiana was the laboratory for testing
                    early public land policy, Rohrbough explains, and William Henry Harrison was the chief designer.
                    Readers acquainted with the author's Land Office Business (1968) will
                    find the Indiana story familiar, but the retelling is deft and concise, and Rohrbough's
                    knack for turning an apt phrase is evident. There are indications that Rohrbough had softened his
                    critical 1968 assessment of government land policy and the adverse impact of land speculation. Here
                    readers are told, in reference to the credit system of 1800–1820, that the government was
                    an "understanding, generous and sympathetic landlord," "loose and
                    tolerant" of Indiana's "incipient capitalists" who
                    "flouted" basic honesty to obtain land and gain "economic independence
                    and a world generally free from want and care for the future" (pp. 47, 55, 56).
            Horsman's highly interpretive historiographical essay, "Changing Images of the
                    Public Domain," is alone worth the price of the book. Gates' work is discussed
                    with particular subtlety and insight. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Horsman's
                    interpretation of Frederick Jackson Turner, who is portrayed—solely on the basis of the
                    1893 frontier essay—as an apologist of the government's democratic, free land
                    policy. In fact Turner's subsequent writings and those of his students, notably Benjamin H.
                    Hibbard, condemned federal land policies for fostering large-scale speculation rather than
                    small-scale farming. Even less satisfactory is Horsman's impassioned and polemical (one is
                    tempted to say irrational) outburst against the new economic land historians, a response that
                    resembles the reaction of some to Robert Fogel's and Stanley Engerman's Time on the Cross. Specifically, Horsman cites Donald Winters' and this
                    reviewer's work on 
                        Iowa
                     farm tenancy and large-scale speculation, respectively, as prime examples of the
                    "dehumanizing" effects of quantitative methods and growth-oriented, neoclassical
                    economics. "One has the feeling," the author opines in commenting on
                    Winters' study of farm tenancy and my public approbation of it, "that if in late
                    nineteenth-century America a good market had developed for the sale of children, and if in order to
                    raise capital to develop their farms 
                        Iowa
                     farmers found it necessary to sell their children, an economic historian would be found
                    who would consider that the practice of selling children was for ‘rational economic
                    reasons’" (p. 77). Some may wonder why rather mundane analyses of land, tax
                    titles, and mortgage instruments should elicit such an ad hominem response.  "If the time has come to revise the revisers"
                    (p. 80), as Horsman contends, then by all means get on with the research task.
            Equally puzzling is Dwight Smith's brief essay on the history of Indian-white land
                    tenureship in which the author offers a startling reinterpretation of the legal charades that are
                    euphemistically called "Indian land cession treaties." According to Smith, such
                    arrangements were "valid instruments" to transfer Indian rights to the land,
                    because such treaties were rooted in Anglo-Saxon law and because they were an
                    "effective" transfer vehicle that "bridged the legal gap between the two
                    diverse cultures and it transferred title to the land" (p. 99). Such pragmatic and circular
                    logic is not altogether satisfying.
            In the book's final contribution, Gates convincingly proves that the national
                    government's continued ownership of extensive underdeveloped lands in Indiana and other
                    early public land states was both unpopular and detrimental economically and especially politically.
                    Controlling large land holdings provided the central government with a strong instrument by which to
                    influence and even dominate the economic development policies of the states, as is the case in
                    Alaska at the present time. Students of nineteenth-century land history can only applaud the
                    publication of this book and lament that most bicentennial efforts did not yield such rich results.

               Indiana Historical Society Lectures, 1976–1977: The History of Education
                        in the Middle West. By Timothy L. Smith and Donald E. Pitzer. (
                        Indianapolis
                    : Indiana Historical Society, 1978. Pp. 101. Notes. Paperbound, $1.50.)
            
               The History of Education in the Middle West contains two extended essays which were
                    presented in 1976 and 1977 as part of a lecture series sponsored by the Indiana Historical Society.
                    Although the Society should be commended for making these excellent papers available to the public,
                    the title is inappropriate and misleading. The first essay, by Timothy L. Smith, is entitled
                    "Uncommon Schools: Christian Colleges and Social Idealism in Midwestern America,
                    1820–1950"; the second, "Education in Utopia: The 
                        New Harmony
                     Experience," was written by Donald E. Pitzer. Smith, claiming that
                    "the religious and educational history" of Indiana and 
                        Illinois
                     "was a microcosm of both regional and national experience" (p. 3),
                    limits his  discussion to those two states; Pitzer's
                    emphasis is obvious. The two essays do not individually or collectively provide The
                        History of Education in the Middle West. "Uncommon Schools" is an
                    interpretative synthesis of the role of church colleges in the social and cultural development of
                    Indiana and 
                        Illinois
                    . Wisely disregarding the histories of individual institutions, Smith is more concerned
                    with such questions as why church schools were established, the nativity and roles of educational
                    leaders, sources of financial support, and the nature of the curriculum. Subsequent sections added
                    to the original paper examine the trend toward sectarianism which emerged in the 1850s and the
                    changing character of church schools in urban environments. Smith's essay is exceptionally
                    well-researched and convincingly provides new insights into the history of education.
            Being a product of one of these institutions, thoroughly steeped in the traditions of a liberal arts
                    education, and teaching at another institution currently agonizing over the value of general
                    education requirements, this reviewer cannot resist quoting one of Smith's quotations.
                    Admittedly a bit chauvinistic for today, it still illustrates the value of history.
            
                    One capital and fatal error has been the idea that we should send a boy to school to learn to
                        WORK, and not simply to THINK; thus absurdly attempting to teach, by public endowment and
                        munificence, the little arts of PERSONAL MANIPULATION, instead of the magnificent SCIENCE of
                        UNIVERSAL SUCCESS. Nothing could be more fatal. When I have taught a boy merely to hold a plow,
                        I have only taught him to be a two-legged jackass, twin brother of the team in front of him. But
                        when I have taught him truly and scientifically all the mighty mysteries of seas, stars, oceans,
                        lands and ages that are concerned in that act of plowing, I have made a man of him …
                        (p. 44).
                
            Pitzer's essay discusses the uses of education in the Utopian communities of Harmony and 
                        New Harmony
                    , Indiana. Focusing briefly on the major sources which inspired them, he examines the
                    educational theories of George Rapp, Robert Owen, and William Maclure in some detail and then
                    demonstrates how these ideas were put into practice. The educational systems they attempted to
                    implement were, Pitzer correctly concludes, remarkably progressive. Among the innovations attributed
                    to these men were Rapp's emphasis on universal education for both sexes and vocational
                    training, Owen's infant and adult programs and his attempts to integrate his views on
                    communitarianism into the educative process, and Maclure's pioneering efforts in
                    establishing an industrial/trade school.
            
            Both essays contribute significantly to the literature in social and intellectual history and provide
                    excellent examples of how the history of education should be written.

            This journal is a resumption of an earlier diary, which Josephine M. Elliott also edited and which
                    the Indiana Historical Society published in 1969 under the title To Holland and To 
                            New Harmony
                        , Robert Dale Owen's Travel Journal, 1825–1826. The
                    previous record described the journey from 
                        Pittsburgh
                     to 
                        New Harmony
                     of the "Boatload of Knowledge," with its passenger list of teachers,
                    scientists, and pupils, and concluded with Owen's arrival at the community on the 
                        Wabash
                     on January 23, 1826. The present record begins in May, 1827, and takes young Owen from 
                        New Harmony
                     to Frances Wright's experimental community of 
                  Nashoba, Tennessee
               , and thence, with Wright, to 
                        France
                    . It ends with Owen's return to the family home, Braxfield, near New Lanark, 
                        Scotland
                    , in August, 1827.
            Because Owen was ill during his week at 
                        Nashoba
                     and also during most of his stay in 
                        New Orleans
                     waiting for the ship that would transport him and Wright to Europe, the month in 
                        France
                     produced more illuminating details than the earlier part of the journey. It is in 
                        Paris
                    , for example, that Owen explains his differences with his father, Robert Owen, over the
                    practices, though not the principles, of the "Community of Equality" on the 
                        Wabash
                    ; and here he writes to his sister, concerning Wright, "I am no more likely to
                    fall in love … with her than with yourself" (p. 40).
            Readers may find modern parallels in Owen's observations about the novelty of the giraffe in
                    the Jardin des Plantes—"its figure is … in every window of prints, on
                    every stage coach; and even the hawkers of gingerbread … [give] to
                    their cakes the form of the Giraffe" (p. 45)—and in General 
                        Lafayette
                    's explanation of the excesses of the French
                    Revolution—"emissaries sent from the English … assumed the garb and
                    language of staunch republicans only to urge acts of cruelty and bloodshed" (p. 50).
            
            Owen was a pragmatic reporter. He discovered that the jaws of a shark caught at sea were large enough
                    to receive his head easily. But he may also have been a gullible man. The appendix contains an
                    account of his experience years later with a spiritualist who, "in exactly twenty-eight
                    minutes" (p. 67) drew a strikingly accurate portrait of Frances Wright's sister,
                    whom the artist had never seen and who had been dead some thirty-six years.
            Only one small error was noted in this otherwise excellent production: Owen's journal states
                    that "nearly opposite Havre is the village of Gonfleur" (p. 34). Here, unless the
                    printer erred, either the author misspelled or the editor misread Honfleur.

            Trying to write this nation's religious history is "like swimming in muddy
                    water," said an eminent and venerable historian in 1960. At that time perhaps he was right.
                    Considerable confusion then existed in the American mind about the difference between church and
                    Christianity, on the one hand, and Christianity and religion, on the other. This confusion was both
                    reflected in and perpetuated by countless works about American religion in which the separation of
                    church and state was celebrated and the distinction between state and church made plain. Other
                    distinctions, however, were so blurred that—from the 1840s when Robert Baird made the
                    first important survey of the religious scene in the 
                        United States
                     until the 1950s when William 
                        Warren
                     Sweet finished working—studies of American religion were concerned almost
                    exclusively with this nation's Christian churches. But that situation has changed
                    dramatically in the last fifteen years. Sidney Mead made differentiation between church and
                    Christianity sharp enough in his Lively Experiment (1963) to reveal how mistaken
                    is the notion that American churches and American Christianity are synonymous. Robert
                    Bellah's 1967 essay on "civil religion" showed that, despite the minimal
                    importance here of religious formulations totally divorced from the Judeo- Christian tradition,
                    Christianity and religion are likewise not  one and the same in
                    the 
                        United States
                    . Martin Marty worked through some of the implications of making these careful
                    distinctions in Righteous Empire (1970). Sydney Ahlstrom carried the course of
                    rigorous discrimination forward by choosing to write A Religious History of the
                        American People (1972) rather than a history of American religion. And now, Robert T. Handy
                    has pushed the clarification process to its outer limits and cleared away the muddy water by writing
                        A History of the Churches in the 
                     United
                            States and Canada
                  
               , a work which
                    makes no pretense of being anything other than what it is: an institutional history of
                    America's churches.
            As does all good institutional history, this account places much emphasis on organizational structure
                    and leadership; as does all good church history, it puts stress on ecclesiastical doctrine and
                    polity, modes of worship, and patterns of belief. But since his work is a part of 
                        Oxford
                    's series on the History of the Christian Church, placing
                    American church history in the larger context of the history of all organized Christendom was
                    Handy's overriding concern. Therefore, major attention rests on the clergy rather than the
                    laity (so much so that the book is a veritable directory of church leaders and their
                    accomplishments); changes in ecclesiastical structure are viewed from the standpoint of church
                    precedent as well as within the innovative organizational arrangements which developed in the new
                    world; and belief patterns and worship modes are related to traditional Christian theology and
                    practice as much as to the indigenous cultural situation.
            This work is not valuable simply because it sets the church history of North America in a wider
                    framework and because it is a church history which refuses to masquerade as a history of religion.
                    New ground is broken with the adding of the history of the churches in 
                        Canada
                     to the already familiar story of what happened to the churches in the 
                        United States
                    . As important as this addition is, however, its proper integration into the story
                    required a straightforward presentation of the materials. Such an organization precluded the
                    systematic use of some scheme of taxonomy—the location of American churches along an
                    evangelical-liturgical continuum, for example—which in the past has been employed to
                    impose order on the chaotic ecclesiastical situation in this nation. The result is a choppy
                    narrative that moves forward from the time of settlement until the day before yesterday, with the
                    focus shifting back and forth from coverage of all the many ecclesiastical developments in one
                    geographical region to a like coverage of a multiplicity of 
                    churches and church-related events in another. The book is a worthy reference tool, but read
                    straight through, it makes even church history seem to be "just one damned thing after
                    another."

            This important book is more than a major contribution to business history. Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.,
                    describes and explains the rise of modern managerial capitalism and the business class that controls
                    and directs it. His book, therefore, is a significant analysis of the nature of modern American
                    society.
            Unlike many economists who view the economy through the lens of supply and demand in the marketplace,
                    Chandler stresses the imperatives of technological change and innovation. In those industries in
                    which technology speeded production and distribution, business leaders faced new opportunities and
                    new problems. The economies of speed allowed for mass production and distribution and the potential
                    for massive profits but also created problems of organization and control. The free market no longer
                    adequately served to supply raw materials and fuel and to move finished goods to the consumer.
                    Business leaders therefore "internalized" both the acquisition of needed supplies
                    and the distribution of finished goods. "The visible hand of managerial direction had
                    replaced the invisible hand of market forces in coordinating the flow of goods from the suppliers of
                    raw and semifinished materials to the retailer and ultimate consumer" (p. 286).
            Big business, therefore, was created by business leaders seeking not only to eliminate competition in
                    order to control prices and otherwise mitigate the rigors of competition but also—and
                    more importantly—to control and coordinate the flow of supplies and the distribution of
                    finished goods. Only industries capable of mass production and distribution experienced successful
                    consolidations. Where tools and machines merely replaced hand labor (for example, in construction or
                    clothing manufacturing) consolidation brought diseconomies. But in other industries, such as steel,
                    electrical equipment, and chemicals,  technology made possible
                    "continuous-process production" which not only replaced hand labor but
                    restructured the entire production process, bringing startling increases in output. Where production
                    remained discontinuous, business remained small and price competitive and continued to rely upon the
                    market for supplies and distribution. Elsewhere, firms became big
                    businesses—oligopolies—which internalized their acquisition of supplies and
                    their distribution network. The huge firms required revolutionary changes in management, and control
                    passed from owners to specially trained and experienced managers.
            A brief review can only sketch in the outlines of this rich, closely argued, and meticulously
                    documented book. It is at once a general history of American business and an explanation for the
                    rise of big business as a peculiarly modern phenomenon. It carefully summarizes the complex details
                    of the history of individual firms and at the same time enhances the general understanding of the
                    social and economic history of modern America. While doing all of this it considers a whole range of
                    problems that have vexed historians over the past generation—for example, the role of
                    railroads in American economic development, the place of the robber barons in the history of
                    business, and the contributions of financiers and expanding capital markets to economic development.
                    And, finally, the book is beautifully written and clearly organized.
            It is perhaps unfair to criticize a book that promises and delivers so much. Yet there are certain
                    areas that Chandler ignores or treats very lightly. He gives inadequate attention to the role of
                    business leaders in managing demand and in managing politics, and, by choosing to ignore labor, he
                    fails to consider the significance of the efforts of business leaders to manage and control the work
                    force. These are areas that other scholars might profitably pursue, armed with the insights and the
                    data Chandler provides in this monumental volume.

                    index. Clothbound, $8.95; paperbound $7.50.) Copshaholm is a
                    fascinating account of what has become an American stereotype—the "rags to
                    riches" family enterprise of the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The Oliver Story is the story of the Oliver chilled plow and the two men, James
                    Oliver and his son Joseph, who parlayed genius, energy, business skill, and an expansive and
                    congenial economic environment into a family fortune. With only a few changes this book might also
                    be the story of Andrew Carnegie or Henry Ford. Joan Romine had access to an abundance of privately
                    held material, and she has used it well. While the Oliver family and their business activities
                    intermesh to form a single focus, the author also casts light upon an important secondary
                    development—the emergence of

                    : Dorrance & Company, 1978. Pp. viii, 134. Notes. $5.95.) This
                    ninety-two year old author takes the reader back to his growing-up days on an isolated farm in 
                        Posey County
                    , Indiana. His lucid memory is filled with vivid pictures of life before the turn of the
                    century. "What an unforgettable experience to arise early in the morning, behold for a few
                    moments the rosy fingers of dawn … dispelling the fogs down in the valley, and walk
                    barefoot across the lush pasture through the bluegrass and white clover baptized with pearly drops
                    of dew." He tells of the hard work on the farm—clearing the forest, planting and
                    harvesting, digging a well, and hog butchering; and he also tells of the fun times—a
                    wedding night chivaree, "snipe" hunting, the one-room school, and the old-time
                    games they played. This is a cozy little book to spend an evening with in front of a log fire. Kenneth P. McCutchan,

                    $7.00.) Despite their reputation for illiteracy and anti-intellectualism, early
                    nineteenth-century Hoosiers regularly declared their dedication to mass education in general and to
                    the significance of public libraries in particular. It was not until the latter part of the century,
                    however, that adequate funds and a public willingness to be taxed for educational and  cultural programs made possible the beginnings of a genuine public
                    school and library system. In the meantime the history of schools and libraries was marked by false
                    starts, frustrations, and failure to bring reality to the ideal of an educated electorate. Most
                    counties experimented with a variety of public, private, and "mixed" libraries in
                    their efforts to acquire library services. They succeeded in the sense that they did put books into
                    the hands of some people who could not afford to buy them, but they were usually short-lived and
                    severely limited in their availability. Some experiments, like the "subscription
                    libraries," were open only to members of the "subscription company";
                    others, like the township trustee libraries, served a wider public, but were constantly plagued by a
                    shortage of funds. In her History of the Public Library in

               , Irene Roberts McDonough traces the appearance and disappearance of a number
                    of the nineteenth-century predecessors of the 
                        Vigo County
                     Public Library and the evolution of that library from its origins as the 
                        Terre Haute
                     Public Library in 1881 to its emergence as a county-wide library system in 1960. A
                    longtime staff member of the library, McDonough has used her knowledge of the records and documents
                    of the agency to flesh out an interesting and readable narrative. One hopes that other counties in
                    Indiana will come forward with similar studies as a contribution to understanding one of our most
                    valuable and most neglected agencies of culture—the public library. J. Robert Constantine, Indiana State University,

                    $12.95; paperbound, $6.95.) This book contains approximately fourscore and
                    fifty quotations from Lincoln and utterances attributed to him, arranged under ten subject
                    headings—truth, freedom, God, etc.—and provides a running commentary which
                    supplies the historical context of most of the quotations. Selected speeches, some of them
                    shortened, are also included, and there is a Lincoln chronology. Documentation is usually
                    satisfactory, but occasionally nonexistent. The majority of the quotations are identified in the
                    narrative as excerpts from Lincoln's speeches and letters, but no authority at all is cited
                    for attributing a few of the remaining statements to Lincoln. Textual inaccuracies occur in many of
                    the passages taken from speeches and letters: words are added; words are transcribed in the wrong
                    order; words are substituted; words, clauses, and even sentences are  omitted without the use of spaced periods to indicate ellipsis; and
                    changes are made in punctuation, spelling, capitalization, and typographical emphasis. The book is

                    abstracts, index. $17.50.) Stephen Harrison Long was a nineteenth-century army engineer
                    and explorer best known for mislabeling the Great Plains as the "Great American
                    Desert." The 
                        Minnesota
                     Historical Society has now published Long's journals for two of the five
                    expeditions he led between 1816 and 1823. In 1817 Long and seven soldiers traveled up the 
                        Mississippi
                     River to the Falls of St. Anthony and down the river to the 
                        Missouri
                    . His expedition of 1823 included soldiers, guides, and several scientists. Long led
                    this party from 
                        Philadelphia
                     through Indiana (with a stay at Ft. 
                        Wayne
                    ) to 
                        Minnesota
                    , up the Red River to 
                        Canada
                    , across the Great Lakes, and back to 
                        Pennsylvania
                    . The book also includes the journal of James E. Colhoun, Long's astronomer on
                    the 1823 trip. Long's journals provide detailed descriptions of the lands covered, the
                    peoples met, and the events of the expeditions. He was a meticulous observer, and this book is
                    mandatory reading for those interested in the early history of the Old Northwest. The editors have
                    made exemplary efforts to identify the names and places mentioned in the journals. While additional
                    maps would have been helpful, The Northern Expeditions of Stephen H. Long is
                    well-edited and nicely presented. The editors and the 
                        Minnesota
                     Historical Society must be applauded for the publication of these journals. Roger G. Miller, Indiana University,
