                <p><hi>I SEEM</hi> to hear many a reader ask whether such atrocities as are
                    described in âThe Heather on Fireâ have indeed been committed with the memory of
                    this generation. Let him be assured that this is no fancy picture; that, on the
                    contrary, the authorâs aim has been to soften some of the worst features of the
                    heartârending scenes which were of such frequent occurrence during the Highland
                    Clearances. Many of them are too revolting for the purposes of art; for the
                    ferocity shown by some of the factors and groundâofficers employed by the
                    landlords in evicting their inoffensive tenantry, can only be matched by the
                    brutal excesses of victorious troops on a foreign soil. But even in those cases
                    where no actual violence was resorted to, the uprooting and transplantation of
                    whole communities<pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7076-003"/> of Crofters from the straths
                    and glens which they had tilled for so many generations must be regarded in the
                    light of a national crime.</p>
                <p>No traveller can have failed to be struck by the solitude and desolation which
                    now constitute the prevalent character of the Scottish Highlands. âMile after
                    mile,â says Macaulay, speaking of Glencoe, âthe traveller looks in vain for the
                    smoke of one hut, or for one human form wrapped in a plaid, and listens in vain
                    for the bark of a shepherdâs dog, or the bleat of a lamb. Mile after mile, the
                    only sound that indicates life is the faint cry of a bird of prey from some
                    stormâbeaten pinnacle of rock.â His words might appropriately stand for a
                    description of a great part of the north of Scotland. But it was not always so.
                    The moors and valleys, whose blank silence is only broken by the rush of
                    tumbling streams or the cry of some solitary bird, were once enlivened by the
                    manifold sounds of some human industry and made musical with childrenâs voices.
                    The crumbling walls and decaying roofâtrees of ruined villages still bear
                    witness to the former populousness of many a deserted glen. Perhaps these humble
                    remains touch our<pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7076-004"/> feelings more deeply than the
                    imposing fragments of Greek temples and Roman amphitheatres. For it was but
                    yesterday that they were inhabited by a brave, moral, and industrious peasantry,
                    full of poetic instincts and ardent patriotism, ruthlessly expelled their native
                    land to make way for sporting grounds rented by merchant princes and American
                    millionaires.</p>
                <p>During a visit I paid to the Isle of Arran in the summer of 1884, I stood on the
                    site of such a ruined village. All that remained of the once flourishing
                    community was a solitary old Scotchwoman, who well remembered her banished
                    countrymen. Her simple story had a thrilling pathos, told as it was on the
                    melancholy slopes of the North Glen Sannox, looking across to the wild broken
                    mountain ridges called âThe Old Wifeâs Steps.â Here, she said, and as far as one
                    could see, had dwelt the Glen Sannox people, the largest population then
                    collected in any one spot of the island, and evicted by the Duke of Hamilton in
                    the year 1832. The lives of these crofters became an idyll in her mouth. She
                    dwelt proudly on their patient labour, their simple joys, and the kind, helpful
                    ways of them; and her brown eyes filled with tears as <pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7076-005"/> she recalled the day of their expulsion, when the
                    people gathered from all parts of the island to see the last of the Glen Sannox
                    folk ere they went on board the brig that was bound for New Brunswick, in
                    Canada. âAh, it was a sore day that,â she sighed, âwhen the old people cast
                    themselves down on the seashore and wept.â</p>
                <p>They were gone, these Crofters, and their dwellings laid low with the hillâside,
                    and their fertile plots of corn overrun with ling and heather; but the stream
                    went rushing on as of old, and as of old the cloven mountain peaks cast their
                    shadow on the valley below whence the once happy people were all goneâgone, too,
                    their dwellingâplaces, and, to use the touching words of a Highland minister,
                    âThere was not a smoke there now.â For the progress of civilisation, which has
                    redeemed many a wilderness, and gladdened the solitary places of the world, has
                    come with a curse to these Highland glens, and turned green pastures and golden
                    harvestâfields once more into a desert.</p>

                                        <p>âThe tenants of Knoydart, like all other Highlanders, had
                                            suffered severely during and after the potato famine in
                                            1846 and 1847, and some of them got into arrear with a
                                            yearâs and some with two yearsâ rent, but they were fast
                                            clearing it off. Mrs. Macdonell and her factor
                                            determined to evict every crofter on her property, to
                                            make room for sheep. In the spring of 1853 they were all
                                            served with summonses of removal, accompanied by a
                                            message that Sir John Macneil, Chairman of the Board of
                                            Supervision, had agreed to convey them Australia. Their
                                            feelings were not considered worthy of the slightest
                                            consideration. They were not even asked whether they
                                            would prefer to <pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7076-101"/>
                                            follow their countrymen to America and Canada. They were
                                            to be treated as if they were nothing better than
                                            Africans, and the laws of their country on a level with
                                            those which regulated South American slavery. The
                                            people, however, had no alternative but to accept any
                                            offer made to them. They could not get an inch of land
                                            on any of the neighbouring estates, and any one who
                                            would give them a nightâs shelter was threatened with
                                            eviction themselves. It was afterwards found not
                                            convenient to transport them to Australia, and it was
                                            then intimated to the poor creatures, as if they were
                                            nothing but common slaves, to be disposed of at will,
                                            that they would be taken to North America, and that a
                                            ship would be at Isle Orsay, in the Island of Skye, in a
                                            few days to receive them, and that they
                                                <emph>must</emph> go on board. The
                                                <name>Sillery</name> soon arrived, and Mrs.
                                            Macdonell and her factor came all the way from Edinburgh
                                            to see the people hounded across in boats, and put on
                                            board this ship, whether they would or not. An
                                            eyeâwitness who described the proceeding at the time, in
                                            a now rare pamphlet, and whom I met last year at Nova
                                            Scotia, characterises the scene as indescribable and
                                            heartârending. The wail of the poor women and children
                                            as they were torn away from their homes would have
                                            melted a heart of stone! Some few families, principally
                                            cottars, refused to go, in spite of every influence
                                            brought to bear upon them, and the treatment they
                                            afterwards received was cruel beyond belief. The houses,
                                            not only of those who went, but of those who remained,
                                            were burnt and levelled to the ground. The Strath was

                                            about in every direction. Stooks of corn and plots of

                                        thoroughly disastrous that it might be deemed scarcely
                                        possible to render it more complete. Between the years 1811
                                        and 1820, 15,000 inhabitants of this northern district were
                                        ejected from their snug inland farms by means for which we
                                        would seek in vain a precedent, except, perhaps, in the
                                        history of the Irish massacre. A singularly wellâconditioned
                                        and wholesome district of country has been converted into
                                        one wide ulcer of wretchedness and woe.â</p>

                                            Fontenoy, when more British soldiers lay dead upon the
                                            field than fell at Waterloo. It was another Highland
                                            regiment that scaled the rockâface over the St.

                                            on the level sward of Abraham. It was a Highland line
                                            that broke the power of the Mahratta hordes and gave
                                            Wellington his maiden victory at Assaye. Thirtyâfour
                                            battalions marched from these glens to fight in America,

                                            notwithstanding all that has been written on the
                                            subject, that not very long ago, in many instances
                                            within the memory of living men, most of the Highland
                                            counties were the scene of evictions on a wholesale
                                            scale, compared with which the forced emigration of the
                                            Irish peasantry sinks into insignificance. Entire
                                            communities, from the patriarch of two generations down
                                            to the newlyâborn babe, were banished <foreign xml:lang="fre" rend="i">en bloc</foreign> to Canada,
                                            and thrown there on their own resources to establish new
                                            homes or to starve. And although the people, except in a
                                            few cases, submitted to expatriation quietly if
                                            unwillingly, where they did manifest any reluctance to
                                            accept their fate, their houses were burned down over
                                            their heads, and they themselves were turned adrift on
                                            the bleak hillâsides, and on the wild and inhospitable
                                            seaâshores of that northern region, to seek subsistence
                                            as best they could. Until 1745, the year of Culloden,
                                            the clan system of land tenure prevailed in the
                                            Highlands, under which the ground belonged not to the
                                            chief alone, but to the community. A clansman could not
                                            be dispossessed of his holding by his chief. After 1745,
                                            however, the English system was introduced. The clans
                                            that had remained loyal to the Crown, as well as <pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7076-104"/> those that had thrown
                                            in their lot with Prince Charles, had their lands
                                            practically confiscated. The Highland chiefs, in short,
                                            were assimilated in position to English landlords. They
                                            were by the central government invested with the
                                            feeâsimple of the land which was once held by the laird
                                            and the clansmen in common, and so a great wrong,
                                            amounting to a national crime, was done to the Highland
                                            population.â</p>

                                            Clearances. In consequence of the English clearances of
                                            the sixteenth century, the spread of commercial
                                            principles, and the dying out of the old notion <pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7076-105"/> and fact of
                                            collective and limited ownership of land, the notion of
                                            individual and absolute ownership had got pretty well
                                            established in England by the middle of last century.
                                            So, after the Rebellion of 1745, the Highland chiefs
                                            being greatly impoverished, the devil came to them in
                                            three different shapes, one after another. First he
                                            appeared in a guise he very often assumesâthe guise of a
                                            pressing creditor; then he came as a jolly sheepâfarmer
                                            from the south, with lots of tin in his pockets; and,
                                            said the jolly sheepâfarmer to the impecunious Highland
                                            chief: âClear out these ââ rascals, who call themselves
                                            your clansmen. Sheep will pay you better than men, and
                                            if you will let the hills and glens to me, Iâll double,
                                            triple, quadruple your rental.â And last of all the
                                            devil came to the Highland chief in another shape he
                                            very often assumesâthat of a sharp lawyer. The chiefs
                                            knew very well that they were but jointâowners with
                                            their clans of the land they occupied, and that crofter
                                            townships had rights of grazing on the hills sanctioned
                                            by immemorial custom; and they knew very well that,
                                            though many a chiefâs estate had been forfeited by Acts
                                            of Attainder, by no Act of Parliament had their
                                            clansmenâs customary rights been forfeited. âBut,â said
                                            the devil in the shape of the sharp lawyer, ânever mind
                                            that. In England they act now on the notion of absolute
                                            ownership, and weâll just assume that your people are
                                            tenantsâatâwill, and that you can do what you like with
                                            them and theirs.â And it was simply on this assumption,
                                            a pure legal fiction, directly in the teeth of all
                                            historical facts, that the Duke of Athole began the
                                            Highland Clearances in clearing Glen Tilt, just one
                                            hundred years ago (1784), and worthily have followed
                                            suit the Dukes of Sutherland and of Argyll.â</p>

                                <p>In his recent work on the Nationalisation of Land, Mr. Alfred
                                    Russell Wallace, in the chapter on âLandlordism in Scotland,â
                                    writes:ââThe facts stated in this chapter will possess, I feel
                                    sure, for many Englishmen, an almost startling novelty; the tale
                                    of oppression and cruelty they reveal reads like one of those
                                    hideous stories peculiar to the dark ages, rather than a simple
                                    record of events happening upon our own land and within the
                                    memory of the present generation. For a parallel to this
                                    monstrous power of the landâowner, under which life and property
                                    are entirely at his mercy, we must go back to mediÃ¦val times, or
                                    to the days when serfdom not having been abolished, the Russian
                                    noble was armed with despotic authority; while the more pitiful
                                    results of this landlord tyranny, the wide devastation of
                                    cultivated lands, the heartless burning of houses, the reckless
                                    creation of pauperism and misery out of wellâbeing and
                                    contentment, could only be expected under the rule of Turkish
                                    Sultans, or greedy and cruel Pashas. Yet these cruel deeds have
                                    been perpetrated in one of the most beautiful portions of our
                                    native land. They are not the work of uncultured barbarians or
                                    of fanatic Moslems, but of soâcalled civilised and Christian
                                    men; andâworst feature of allâthey are not due to any
                                    highâhanded exercise of power beyond the law, but are strictly
                                    legal, are in many cases the acts of the legislature itself. . .
                                    . The general results of the system of modern landlordism in
                                    Scotland are not less painful than the hardship and misery
                                    brought upon individual sufferers. The earlier improvers, who
                                    drove the peasants from their sheltered valleys to the exposed
                                    seaâcoast, in order to make room for sheepâfarmers, pleaded
                                    erroneously the public benefit as the justification of <pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7076-107"/> their conduct. They
                                    maintained that more food and clothing would be produced by the
                                    new system, and that the people themselves would have the
                                    advantage of the produce of the sea as well as that of the land
                                    for their support. The result, however, proved them to be
                                    mistaken, for thenceforth the cry of Highland destitution began
                                    to be heard, culminating at intervals into actual famines, like
                                    that of 1836â37, when Â£70,000 were distributed to keep the
                                    Highlanders from death by starvation. . . Just as in Ireland,
                                    there was abundance of land capable of cultivation, but the
                                    people were driven to the coast and to the towns to make way for
                                    sheep, and cattle, and lowland farmers; and when the barren and
                                    inhospitable tracts allotted to them became overcrowded, they
                                    were told to emigrate.</p>
                                <p>âThe actual effect of this system of eviction and emigrationâ of
                                    banishing the native of the soil and giving it to the stranger
                                    âis shown in the steady increase of poverty, indicated by the
                                    amount spent for the relief of the poor having increased from
                                    less than Â£300,000 in 1846 to more than Â£900,000 now; while in
                                    the same period the population has only increased from 2,770,000
                                    to 3,627,000, so that pauperism has grown about nine times
                                    faster than population. . . . </p>
                                <p>âAt the present time more than two million acres of Scottish soil
                                    are devoted to the preservation of deer aloneâan area larger
                                    than the entire counties of Kent and Surrey combined. Glen Tilt
                                    Forest includes 100,000 acres; the Black Mount is sixty miles in
                                    circumference; and Ben Aulder Forest is fifteen miles long by
                                    seven broad. On many of these forests there is the finest
                                    pasture in Scotland, while the valleys would support a
                                    considerable population of small farmers; yet all this land is
                                    devoted to the sport of the wealthy, farms being destroyed,
                                    houses pulled down, and men, sheep, and cattle all banished to
                                        <pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7076-108"/> create a wilderness for
                                    the deerâstalkers! At the same time the whole people of England
                                    are shut out from many of the grandest and most interesting
                                    scenes of their native land, gamekeepers and watchers forbidding
                                    the tourist or naturalist to trespass on some of the wildest
                                    Scotch mountains.â</p>
                                <p>âThe cruel practice of evicting the Highlanders to make room for
                                    sheep seems to be passing into the pernicious system of <emph rend="i">converting grazing lands into sporting
                                        grounds</emph>. Only the other day an extensive tract was
                                    cleared of 7000 sheep to add to the already wide forests of
                                    Glenstrathfarar and Culligran, the property of Lord Lovat, let
                                    to Mr. Winans of Brighton, at Â£7000 per annum. It is said that
                                    this nobleman, being desirous of securing more broad acres for
                                    his American âSportsman!â who boasts of having, with the help of
                                    his two sons, brought down twentyâseven stags in about an hour
                                    last September, has leased the sheepâfarm in question at a rent
                                    of Â£1000 aâyear, and subâlet it to Mr. Winans for Â£2000, thus
                                    netting Â£1000 per annum by the transaction. I blush to think
                                    that a Scottish nobleman should lend himself to satisfying the
                                    insatiable desire of a foreign millionaire contractor to make a
                                    profit by a system which depopulates the Highlands, is a curse
                                    to Scotland, and, as you very properly observed, âa scandal to
                                    British legislation.â</p>
                                <p>âSad it is to see the rights and welfare of the Highlanders
                                    pitilessly disregarded, and the beautiful hills, straths, and
                                    glens of Scotland immolated to the sporting snobbishness of
                                    greedy capitalists. The existence of âmammoth deerâforestsâ is
                                    one of the gravest wrongs of the people, perpetrated under the
                                    mask of a false political economy, and I defy anyone to prove
                                    the utility of the cruel clearances that have so scandalised the
                                    Northern Highlands.</p>

                                <p>âIn former removals the tenants had been allowed to carry away
                                    the timber of their old dwellings to erect houses on their new
                                    allotments, but now a more summary mode was adopted by setting
                                    fire to them. The ableâbodied men were by this time away after
                                    the cattle, or otherwise engaged at a distance, so that the
                                    immediate sufferers by the general houseâburning that now
                                    commenced were the aged and infirm, the women and children. . .
                                    . The devastators proceeded with the greatest celerity,
                                    demolishing all before them; and when they had overthrown all
                                    the houses in a large tract of country, they set fire to the
                                    wreck. Timber, furniture, and every other article that could not
                                    be instantly removed was consumed by fire, or otherwise utterly
                                    destroyed. The proceedings were carried on with the greatest
                                    rapidity and the most reckless cruelty. Some old men took to the
                                    woods and the rocks, wandering about in a state approaching to
                                    or of absolute insanity; and several of <pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7076-110"/> them in this situation lived only a
                                    few days. Pregnant women were taken in premature labour, and
                                    several children did not long survive their sufferings. To those
                                    scenes I was an eyeâwitness, and am ready to substantiate the
                                    truth of my statements, not only by my own testimony, but by
                                    that of many others who were present at the time. In such a
                                    scene of devastation it is almost useless to particularise the
                                    cases of individuals: the suffering was great and universal. I
                                    shall, however, notice a very few of the extreme cases, of which
                                    I was myself an eyeâwitness. John Mackayâs wife, Ravigill, in
                                    attempting to pull down her house, in the absence of her
                                    husband, to preserve the timber, fell through the roof. She was
                                    in consequence taken in premature labour, and in that state was
                                    exposed to the open air and the view of all the bystanders.
                                    Donald Munro, Garvott, lying in a fever, was turned out of his
                                    house and exposed to the elements. Donald Macbeath, an infirm
                                    and bedâridden old man, had the house unroofed over him, and was
                                    in that state exposed to the wind and rain until death put a
                                    period to his sufferings. I was present at the pulling down and
                                    burning of the house of William Chisholme, Badinloskin, in which
                                    was lying his wifeâs mother, an old bedridden woman of nearly
                                    one hundred years of age, none of the family being present. . .
                                    . Fire was set to the house, and the blankets in which she was
                                    carried out were in flames before she could be got out. She was
                                    placed in a little shed, and it was with great difficulty they
                                    were prevented from firing it also. Within five days she was a
                                    corpse.â</p>

                                        <p>âAs Strathnaver, though from many causes the most widely
                                            bruited, was by no means a solitary instance of rash
                                            reform and harsh procedure, we must give another example
                                            of the same ruthless process of extermination which took
                                            place some forty years later in a quite different
                                            region. We allude to the inhabitants of the district of
                                            Knoydart, who were cleared out of their native seats in
                                            the year 1853, in a fashion for which the Strathnaver
                                            procedure seemed to have formed the model, and of which
                                            an account is given by Donald Ross, an eyeâwitness.</p>
                                        <p>â âThe scene presented at Knoydart was most
                                            heartârending. As far as the eye could see the face of
                                            the strath had it black spots, where the houses of the
                                            crofters were either levelled or burnt. The ruins of
                                            these habitations of men, and the silence and solitude
                                            that prevailed, rendered it unnecessary for any tongue
                                            to tell me that here humanity was most cruelly
                                            sacrificed to the god of sheepâfarming and expatriation.
                                            The blackened rafters lying scattered among the grass,
                                            the coupleâtrees cut through the middle and thrown away,
                                            the walls broken down, thatch and cabers mixed up
                                            together, and grass beginning to grow on the threshold
                                            and hearthstone, told a tale which required neither
                                            tongue nor pen to unfold. The scene was rendered more
                                            painful as the Strath was dotted with stacks of corn,
                                            large plots of potatoes, and with grass that could be
                                            easily mowed down by the scythe. But the voice of man
                                            was goneâ he was not to be found.ââ</p>

                                            the North American Indians. . . . Who can withhold
                                            sympathy, as whole families have turned to take a last
                                            look at the heavens red with their burning houses? The
                                            poor people shed no tears, for there was in their hearts
                                            that which stifled such signs of emotion; they were
                                            absorbed in despair. They were forced away from that

                                <p>âAmong the rest, a young man, Donald MacKay, of Grambmor, was
                                    ordered out of his parentsâ house; he obeyed in a state of
                                    delirium, and (nearly naked) ran into some bushes adjoining,
                                    where he lay for a considerable time deprived of reason; the
                                    house was immediately in flames, and his effects burned. Robert
                                    MacKay, whose whole family were in the fever, or otherwise
                                    ailing, had to carry his two daughters on his back a distance of
                                    about twentyâfive miles. . . . A number of the sick, who could
                                    not be carried away instantly, on account of their dangerous
                                    situation, were collected by their friends and placed in an
                                    uncomfortable hut, and there for a time left to their fate. The
                                    cries of these victims were heartârendingâexclaiming in their
                                    anguish, âAre you going to leave us to perish in the flames?â .
                                    . . It may not be out of place here to mention generally that
                                    the clergy, factors, and magistrates were cool and apparently
                                    unconcerned spectators of the scenes I have been describing,
                                    which were indeed perpetrated under their <pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7076-113"/> immediate authority. The splendid and
                                    comfortable mansions of these gentlemen were reddened with the
                                    glare of their neighboursâ flaming houses, without exciting any
                                    compassion for the sufferers; no spiritual, temporal, or medical
                                    aid was afforded them; and this time they were all driven away
                                    without being allowed the benefit of their outâgoing crops!
                                    Nothing but the sword was wanting to make the scene one of as
                                    great barbarity as the earth ever witnessed; and in my opinion,
                                    this would, in a majority of cases, have been mercy, by saving
                                    them from what they were afterwards doomed to endure. The clergy
                                    indeed, in their sermons, maintained that the whole was a
                                    merciful interposition of Providence to bring them to
                                    repentance, rather than to send them all to hell, as they so
                                    richly deserved.â</p>

                                <p>One of the Royal Commissioners remarkedââIt is said in reference

                                    some of them had been tied before our eyes; others hid
                                    themselves in caves and crevices for fear of being caught by
                                    authorised officers.â</p>
                                <p>âQ.ââDo you recall that these people were caught and sent to
                                    America, just like an animal going to market?â</p>
                                <p>âA.ââJust the same way. I saw a man who lay down on his face and
                                    knees on a little island to hide himself from the policeman,
                                        <emph rend="i">who had dogs searching for him</emph> in
                                    order to get him aboard the emigrant ship. . . . There was
                                    another case of a man named Angus Johnson. He had a dead child
                                    in the house, and his wife gave birth to three children, all of
                                    whom died. Notâ<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7076-114"/> withstanding
                                    this he was seized and tied on the pier at Loch Boisdale and
                                        <emph rend="i">kicked</emph> on board. The old priest
                                    interfered and said, âWhat are you doing to this man? let him
                                    alone, it is against the law!â The wife of the man who was tied

                                <p>âAll the Highlanders of an inland district in Sutherlandshire
                                    were ejected from their homes by the late Duke to make way for a
                                    few <emph rend="i">sheepâfarmers</emph>. The poor people, a
                                    moral and religious race, bound to their rugged hills with a
                                    strength of attachment hardly equalled in any other country,
                                    could not be made to believe the summonses of removal real.
                                    Their fathers had lived and died among those very hills for
                                    thousands of years. They had spent their blood and had laid down
                                    their lives of old for the good Earls of Sutherland. Could it be
                                    possible that they were to be forced out of their own country?
                                    They at first thought of resistance, and had they carried the
                                    thought into action, it would have afforded perilous employment
                                    to a thousand armed men to have ejected every eight hundred of
                                    them; but they had read their New Testaments, and they knew that
                                    the Duke had become proprietor of the soil; some of their houses
                                    were actually fired over their heads, and yet there was no
                                    bloodshed. Convinced at <pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7076-115"/>
                                    length that no other alternative remained for them, they
                                    gathered in a body in the churchyard of the district, to take
                                    leave of their country for ever, and of the dust of their
                                    fathersâ last. And there, seated among the graves, men and
                                    women, the old and the young, with one accord, and under the
                                    influence of one feeling, âlifted up their voices and wept.â
                                    This tract of the Highlands is now inhabited by sheep.â</p>

                                    Stornoway, in the Highlands of Scotland, do solemnly depose to
                                    the following facts:âThat Colonel Gordon is proprietor of
                                    estates in South Uist of Barra; that among many hundred tenants
                                    and cottars whom he has sent this season from his estates to
                                    Canada, he gave directions to his factor, Mr. Fleming, of Cluny
                                    Castle, Aberdeenshire, to ship on board of the aboveânamed
                                    vessel a number of nearly four hundred and fifty of said tenants
                                    and cottars, from the estate in Barra; that accordingly, a great
                                    majority of these people, among whom were the undersigned,
                                    proceeded voluntarily to embark on board the
                                        <name>Admiral</name> at Loch Boisdale, on or about 11th
                                    August 1851; but that several of the people who were intended to
                                    be shipped for this port, Quebec, refused to proceed on board,
                                    and, in fact, absconded from their homes to avoid the
                                    embarkation. Whereupon Mr. Fleming gave orders to a policeman,
                                    who was accompanied by a groundâofficer of the estate in Barra,
                                    and some constables, to pursue the people who had run away among
                                    the mountains; which they did, and succeeded in capturing about
                                    twenty from the mountains and islands in the neighborhood; but
                                    only <pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7076-116"/> came with the officers
                                    on an attempt being made to handcuff them; and that some who ran
                                    away were not brought back, in consequence of which four
                                    families at least were divided, some having come in the ships to
                                    Quebec, while other members of the same families are left in the
                                    Highlands. . . .</p>

                                    their superfluity of population, but of the whole mass of the
                                    inhabitants, dispossessed by an unrelenting avarice, which will
                                    be one day found to have been as shortâsighted as it is unjust
                                    and selfish. Meantime, the Highlands may become the fairyâground
                                    for romance and poetry, or the subject of experiment for the
                                    professors of speculation, political and economical. But if the
                                    hour of need should comeâand it may not, perhaps be far
                                    distantâthe pibroch may sound through the deserted region, but
                                    the summons will remain unanswered.â</p>

                                <p>âMen talk of the Sutherland clearings as if they stood alone
                                    amidst the atrocities of the system; but those who know fully
                                    the facts of the case can speak with as much truth of Rossâshire
                                        <pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7076-117"/> clearings, the
                                    Invernessâshire clearings, the Perthshire clearings, and, to
                                    some extent, the Argyleshire clearings. . . . Crossing to the
                                    south of the great glen, we may begin with Glencoe. How much of
                                    its romantic interest does the glen owe to its desolation? Let
                                    us remember, however, that the desolation, in a large part of
                                    it, is the result of the extrusion of its inhabitants. Travel
                                    eastward and the footprints of the destroyer cannot be lost
                                    sight of. Large tracts along the Spean and its tributaries are a
                                    wide waste. The southern bank of Loch Lochy is almost without
                                    inhabitants, though the symptoms of former occupancy are
                                    frequent. When we enter the country of the Frasers, the same
                                    spectacle presents itselfâa desolate land. Trace the Beauly
                                    through all its upper reaches, and how many thousands upon
                                    thousands of acres, once peopled, are, as respects human beings,
                                    a wild wilderness. . . . Sutherland, with all its atrocities,
                                    affords but a fraction of the atrocities that have been
                                    perpetrated in following out the ejectment system of the
                                    Highlands. In truth, of the habitable portion of the whole
                                    country, but a small part is now really inhabited.</p>
                                <p>âLet us leave the past, however, and consider the present, and it
                                    is a melancholy reflection that the year 1849 has added its long
                                    list of Highland ejectments. While the law is banishing its tens
                                    for terms of seven or fourteen years, as the penalty of
                                    deepâdyed crimes, irresponsible and infatuated power is
                                    banishing its thousands for life for no crime whatever.â</p>
