                    small eastern and midwestern cities, it had industrialized rapidly over the preceding fifty years,
                    particularly during and after the northeastern Indiana gas boom of the 1890s. Yet its social
                    composition was unusual for a factory town. It was home to families from both the upland South and
                    the northeastern U.S., but, unlike most urban settings outside the South, it had relatively few
                    immigrants. At the same time, African Americans were settling there at a rapid rate-more rapid than
                    that of white newcomers. <placeName>

                    </placeName> in part for its distinguishing social characteristics. Although they noted the
                    "middle-of-the-road quality" of the city, chose the generic name of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and added the subtitle "a study in modern American culture," they also insisted that
                    it was not a "typical" city and that the findings could be applied to the rest of the country "only
                    with caution." Nevertheless, Americans quickly began to view the city as a representative slice of
                    the nation, and scholars, including the Lynds themselves, repeatedly returned to the city to measure
                    the degree of change in American culture and society over the course of the twentieth century.<hi

                    <pb n="213" id="VAA4025-101-3-009"/> The conference marked the seventy-fifth anniversary of the
                    publication of the Lynds’ first book. It featured scholars from a variety of disciplines who
                    presented recent work on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> and who reflected on the origins and development of research on <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Included here are Staughton Lynd's keynote address, which links the ideals and
                    experiences of his parents with their choice of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>; a revised version of Sarah Igo's provocative paper explaining how "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName>" came to be seen as the quintessential American community; and John Straw's catalog of
                    the rich set of resources that continue to attract investigators of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> experience. Together they help us understand the legacies of the Lynds’ original
                    investigation, including both the difficulties created by the selection of an apparently homogeneous
                    white Protestant community and the reasons why those seeking to understand modern America continue
                    to return to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> despite its demographic quirks.</p>
                <p>The question of typicality has been at the center of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> studies from the start. The Lynds addressed it in the first pages of <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                        </placeName>,</hi> and virtually every researcher who has followed in their footsteps has
                    acknowledged it to some degree. A few observers, mostly journalists, have accepted the notion
                    uncritically. But academics have usually been more cautious, promising to construct "a chain of
                    inference" before generalizing from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the nation. Nevertheless, the same scholars have felt compelled to defend the idea
                    that the city was representative. As the foremost successor to the Lynds recently declared, in
                    response to a question about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s typicality, "if you look at the divorce rate, the robbery rate, the number of books

                    </placeName> research. The Lynds were executing a "small city study" commissioned by the Institute
                    for Social and Religious Research (ISRR). Launched with the financial support of oil magnate John D.
                    Rockefeller, Jr., the ISRR sought religious solutions to the social problems of industrial America.
                    Rockefeller was alarmed by escalating class conflict in the early twentieth century. He believed
                    religious activism offered the most likely means of reducing the tensions of industrial life and so
                    funded the organization that would become the ISRR. After <list type="footnotes">

                <p>The Lynds were the second choice to direct the project, and a surprising one in some respects. In
                    1923 the ISRR tapped Northwestern University sociologist William Louis Bailey but soon rejected him
                    as unsuited to the participant-observer-style research they sought. In his place they selected
                    Robert S. Lynd, a native Hoosier, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName> alumnus, and former divinity student. That Rockefeller accepted Lynd was surprising,
                    given that Lynd had sharply criticized Rockefeller and Standard Oil for its treatment of workers in
                    a 1922 article published in <hi rend="i">The Survey Graphic,</hi> a reform magazine that mixed
                    empirical analysis and illustrations of social problems. The article recounted Lynd's experience as
                    a preacher and laborer in a Wyoming oil field during the summer of 1921 and blamed Rockefeller for
                    the poor working conditions there. The ISRR nevertheless chose Lynd, in part to imply that it was
                    independent from Rockefeller, its chief financial backer.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

                    originally selected <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, from a list compiled by Bailey, but decided not to conduct the study there
                    for fear that the size and cultural variety of the city would make a fine-grained analysis
                    impractical. After further consideration, he picked <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a smaller and considerably less diverse community that would allow a more thorough and
                    complete investigation. The choice of a more ethnically uniform city was intentional. The Lynds
                    explained in the opening section of <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>

                        </placeName>
                    </hi> that "it seemed a distinct advantage to deal with a homogeneous native-born population, even
                    though such a population is unusual in an American industrial city." As for the growing black
                    population, they simply ignored it, making "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName>" a whiter community than was 1920s <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This would permit the investigators to deal with just one major issue-the impact of
                    modernization on the community-"instead of being forced to handle two major variables, racial change
                    and cultural change." In the parlance of 1920s America, the phrase "racial change" meant not only
                    shifts in the ratio of blacks and whites in the city, but also the growth of immigrant populations.
                    By eliminating racial and ethnic complexity, the Lynds aimed to concentrate on the issue of class
                    conflict that had inspired the ISRR project in the first place.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

                    arrived during the 1820s, and the village they established grew slowly, remaining a sleepy market
                    town of 5,000 into the 1880s. The discovery of natural gas in nearby Eaton, Indiana, in 1886, along
                    with the efforts of local boosters, drew manufacturers such as the Ball Brothers’ glass jar company
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>

                    By 1890 there were 11,345 people in the city; a decade later the federal census reported a
                    population of 20,942. The natural gas supply ran out in the early twentieth century, but the city
                    continued to attract new factories, most notably automobile plants, and the population grew
                    steadily. It had climbed to 36,524 in 1920 and reached 46,548 a decade later.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

                <p>The central purpose of the Lynds’ research was to gauge the impact of this dramatic transformation on
                    the values and habits of local residents. Robert Lynd, his wife Helen Merrell Lynd, and a
                    three-person staff arrived in the city in January 1924 and spent almost two years there. Although
                    none was a formally trained social scientist, they employed anthropological methods, particularly a
                    framework devised by W. H. R. Rivers. It divided human experience into six areas: getting a living,
                    making a home, training the young, using leisure, engaging in religious practices, and engaging in
                    community activities. These became the organizing categories of the book, which in turn became far
                    more than the survey of religious life that the ISRR had commissioned. The Lynds also structured the
                    volume as a comparison between life in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1890 and life during the mid-1920s. To complete the project they conducted surveys,
                    participated in and observed community activities, clipped newspaper articles, and examined archival
                    materials before returning to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> to write.</p>
                <p>What the Lynds produced was a sharply observed portrait of a community not entirely aware of the
                    changes wrought by industrialization. The fairly harmonious city of 1890 had given way to a
                    community split into two groups, the business class and the working class, each of which led
                    significantly different lives. But the conflict such divisions might be expected to produce had not
                    developed in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, largely because the availability of consumer goods made the prospects for material
                    success and improved social status seem real to workers and their families. This critique of
                    American society was accompanied by an impressive array of detail about work experiences, family
                    life, gender roles, reading habits, the social impact of the automobile, and a host of other topics,
                    large and small.</p>
                <p>In departing so dramatically from the original concept of the project, the Lynds lost the support of
                    the ISRR. After reading an early draft of the manuscript, Rockefeller's lawyer wrote to Galen
                    Fisher, the director of the Institute, that "it is very scopey and its range of ideas positively
                    bewildering." He was particularly hostile to the Lynds’ emphasis on class differences and expressed
                    doubt as to whether they would ultimately produce a publishable manuscript. In the end, the
                    Institute's staff concluded that the book was not publishable, and the Lynds were given permission
                    to market it on their own. They sent the manuscript to Alfred Harcourt, who quickly agreed to issue
                    it under his Harcourt and Brace imprint. The book appeared in 1929 and was a huge success. It was
                    widely reviewed and widely praised, and became a best seller and sociological classic that has
                    remained in print ever since.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    the current economy. These chapters gave the book a sharper, more critical tone than the first
                    volume, and it never achieved quite the same status or popular resonance as its predecessor.<hi

                <p>Others picked up where the Lynds left off, although often from a different political perspective.
                    During the 1970s, a team of sociologists led by Theodore Caplow, Howard Bahr, and Bruce Chadwick
                    came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> to replicate and expand upon the original studies in a project they labeled <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> III. They produced two books, <hi rend="i">

                        </placeName> Families and All Faithful People,</hi> along with numerous articles in academic
                    journals. The first book reported optimistically that family life had remained stable in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, impervious to the modernizing changes that were supposed to have undermined it. The
                    second contended that institutional religion remained a strong element of American life, but that
                    tolerance of religious differences had increased. Caplow and Bahr returned in the late 1990s, along
                    with sociologist Louis Hicks, to conduct <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> IV, once again finding significant continuities in the values and beliefs of
                    Middletowners. Filmmaker Peter Davis came to the city in 1979 and commenced a critically acclaimed
                    documentary film series that was broadcast on public television during the early 1980s. Interspersed
                    among these larger projects have been dozens of smaller academic and journalistic inquiries, all of

                    accept <placeName>

                    </placeName> as a representative slice of American life. But there were larger forces at work as
                    well. The demand to identify the typical in America-"part empirical quest, part cultural obsession"
                    as Igo puts it-intensified sharply during the 1920s and 1930s. Several decades of immigration and
                    industrialization fueled this demand and <hi rend="i">

                        </placeName>
                    </hi> was soon caught up in it, despite the Lynds’ explicit disavowal of any claims of typicality

                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Journalists, marketers, and social scientists flocked to the city in the ensuing
                    decades, all confident to one degree or another that they were examining a quintessentially American
                    community.</p>
                <p>As the articles by Lynd and Igo imply, the most significant challenge to assertions of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s typicality revolves around the question of cultural diversity. The Lynds’ decisions
                    to choose a city with few immigrants and to ignore the city's black community have long been the
                    chief impediments to claims that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>

                    remain largely invisible in both studies. Criticism of their absence is more than a matter of
                    political correctness. As Jack Blocker has noted, the presence of a growing number of black workers
                    may well have hindered unionization in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The city was a relatively hospitable place for blacks in part because of the local
                    elite's racial tolerance, a stance that may have been fueled by a desire to keep the working class
                    divided. Since the city had few immigrants, the ethnic obstacles to worker unity that were so common
                    in other industrial communities did not exist in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Without a significant pool of black labor for employers to draw on, workers would have
                    been less divided and perhaps more likely to act collectively. While the Lynds <list

                    imperfectly aware of what was implied by jokes and songs that he repeated endlessly. Such a joke
                    concerned the African American soldier who confronted a German soldier during World War I. Each took
                    a pass at the other. The German said, "Missed me." The black man, armed with a razor, replied, "Just
                    wait till you wiggle your haid." Such a song at <placeName>

                        native-born population, even though such a population is unusual in an American industrial city.
                        Thus, instead of being forced to handle two major variables, racial change and cultural change,
                        the field staff was enabled to concentrate upon cultural change. The study thus became one of
                        the interplay of a relatively constant native American stock and its changing environment. As
                        such it may possibly afford a baseline group against which the process of social change in the
                        type of community that includes different racial backgrounds may be studied by future

                <p>A fetish is a material object that has been invested with the powers of the spiritual reality it
                    represents. Thus a mask is a fetish when it is believed to possess the potency of the person or God
                    depicted. Idols are fetishes, and a great deal of the Old Testament is devoted to discussing and
                    occasionally destroying idols.</p>
                <p>Words can also be fetishes. The philosopher Alfred North Whitehead coined the term "misplaced
                    concreteness" to indicate what happens when we attribute to an abstraction like a word the concrete
                    particularity of something real. My mother, as a teacher, would sometimes say to her students when
                    they seemed to be caught up in a discussion of words and labels, "Let's just call what we are
                    talking about X, and proceed."</p>
                <p>I say all this pursuant to a plea that we not make fetishes of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, or Robert and Helen Lynd. Assume for the moment that what I have just suggested is
                    true: that my parents’ experience of African Americans and the foreign-born was limited, and they
                    chose for this reason to study a community consisting almost entirely of persons who were white and
                    born in the <placeName>

                    let's ask: What would my parents say if they could comment on this decision now? What would they do
                    if they were 25 years old again in the first years of the 21st century, and were once again asked to

                    had to do it again in the 21st century, they would find a way to put the transcendence of racial,
                    ethnic, and national boundaries at the center of their project.</p>
                <p>I remember two movies I attended with my parents as a child. One was a Soviet documentary portraying
                    the surrender of German troops after the battle of Stalingrad in 1943. The Germans were shown in
                    rags, their feet bound in huge clumps of cloth against the cold. Derisive music played as they
                    surrendered. My mother was furious. You don't humiliate a defeated enemy. You don't contemptuously
                    caricature any other human being.</p>
                <p>The other movie was a French film of the 1930s, <hi rend="i">Grand Illusion.</hi> Two soldiers
                    captured during World War 1, an auto mechanic and a middle-class Jew, escape from a German prison.
                    Rosenthal twists his ankle and Marechal becomes increasingly angry with his companion's slow
                    progress. They quarrel and decide to separate. Marechal says, "I never liked your kind anyway."
                    Rosenthal responds, "It's a little late for that." Marechal strides off, singing. Rosenthal calls
                    after him that he is so happy to be rid of Marechal that he, too, can sing, and starts to do so. The
                    moment Marechal is out of earshot Rosenthal, sitting on a rock, begins to cry. Then Marechal's
                    overcoat comes into view at the edge of the movie frame. Marechal takes his friend under the arm,
                    helps him to his feet, and they go on together.</p>
                <p>This movie (which I have watched literally dozens of times) displayed the ethic that my parents acted
                    out at Christmas, when they invited to our home persons who were alone for the holiday and had

                    Dumenil writes that the 1920s were "distinguished by Americans’ growing consciousness of change, a
                    perception that a yawning gulf separated them from the world of only a decade before." As such, <hi

                    all, anthropological approach to American culture. In his foreword to the study, Clark Wissler, an
                    anthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, summed up the shock the book would create:
                    "to most people, anthropology is a mass of curious information about savages," that is, not a tool
                    that had been applied to "civilized" white Americans. Commentators, both popular and scholarly, made

                    and its particular style of reportage could make it appear otherwise. The Lynds "have collected case

                    authors do not tell us … [their conclusions] in so many words. They are too unbiased and too
                    scientific to do so." Observed another, "These are the cold, objective facts, as impersonal as the

                    investigation: "average" American life. Hundreds of studies of gangs, factory workers, immigrants,

                    "special studies … made of the notorious trio, ‘dependent, defective and delinquent.’" Unlike
                    surveyors who had gone before them, Wissler recognized, the Lynds’ attention was trained not on
                    worrisome subgroups or social problems-"coal miners, teamsters, working girls, etc."-nor indeed on
                    any particular fraction of the population, but on the nation writ large. The rhetorical turn from
                    "others" to "ourselves," from the usual objects of anthropology to "typical Americans," was a key
                    source of fascination for those who encountered the Lynds’ survey. <hi rend="i">

                <p>It was this particular conjunction of objective science and "average America" that enabled a social

                    survey was at once a symptom of national introspection and an agent in defining the terms of the
                    discussion. One contemporary admirer of the Lynds’ work put it this way: "the portrait of a

                    commonality was difficult to discern and national culture seemed deeply fragmented and unstable.
                    Noting the intense class, racial, ethnic, and political conflicts of the early 1920s, historian
                    Margo Anderson writes that, to many, urban industrial society had come to appear "a monstrous
                    perversion of American ideals and ways of life." The 1920 Census, which indicated that the
                    rural-urban balance of the country was tilting decisively toward the latter and that the
                    foreign-born were overtaking old-stock Americans, "seemed to confirm the pessimist's worst fears."
                    Rather than viewing these trends as harbingers of inevitable social change, elites in Congress and
                    elsewhere sought to reverse the current. It was, of course, a coincidence that the Lynds set out for

                    its effort to curtail immigration from all countries save those of Western Europe, became law. But
                    in the context of renewed nativism, eugenic designs, and postwar patriotism-indeed, the height of

                    Collapsing any distinctions between Middletowners and himself, the book's reviewer for the <hi

                    work, learn, love, and play in a typical though anonymous Middlewestern city." Comparing the study
                    to an unforgiving mirror, he continued: "If you believe it would do your soul good to look at such a
                    reflection of yourself-yourself and all the rest of us-then look into this book's pages-and if you
                    can, keep from unhappy pondering as to what manner of man-and woman-you and all the rest of us are
                    apparently becoming!" "Surely these people cannot be our fellow citizens," lamented another
                    commentator, "they cannot be us. But they are." Embracing Middletowners as "us," this sort of
                    reportage reinforced <placeName>

                    at the normal in American life." This was certainly true. However, the Lynds explicitly eschewed any
                    claim for their site's typicality in the introduction to the first study. They wrote: "although it
                    was its characteristic rather than its exceptional features which led to the selection of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, no claim is made that it is a ‘typical’ city, and the findings of this study can,
                    naturally, only with caution be applied to other cities or to American life in general." Over the
                    years, both researchers reiterated this disavowal. Of course, by titling the study "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName>" and by describing it as an account of "contemporary culture," the Lynds did suggest

                    was not an oversight, but a carefully considered aspect of the research design-one that broke
                    dramatically with the emphasis of both prior social surveys and contemporary studies like those of

                    authors, however, reasoned that there were scientific advantages to dealing with "a homogeneous,
                    native-born population," namely fewer "variables" to contend with. Explained Robert Lynd to his
                    sponsoring agency regarding the decision to limit the study to native white American stock: "The
                    reason for this is obvious: since we are attempting a difficult new technique in a highly
                    complicated field, it is desirable to simplify our situation as far as possible. The interaction of
                    the material and cultural trends in the city with our native psychology is problem enough without
                    introducing into this initial study the complicating factor of a psychology molded by a foreign
                        environment."<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                    because its ethnic diversity was so limited. Populated largely by farm-born factory workers, it was
                    a "demographic curiosity," more "old stock" (88 percent of the population) than any other Midwestern

                    components of the community, so too were most of the pressing, and even typical, problems of
                    American cities in the 1920s. "The very middle-of-the-road quality about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> would have made it unsuitable for a different kind of investigation," announced the
                    Lynds in the opening pages of their first book. Here they reinforced the novelty of their survey,
                    its turn to the normal and average: "Had this study sought simply to observe the institution of the
                    home under extreme urban conditions, the recreational life of industrial workers, or any one of
                    dozens of other special ‘social problems,’ a far more spectacular city than <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> might readily have been found." By labeling "spectacular" and "special" the everyday
                    forces reshaping U.S. cities, the Lynds implied that such forces were aberrant, and therefore not
                    truly representative of mainstream American life. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, on the other hand, was sought out precisely because it was sheltered from "extreme,"
                    if common, urban conditions. Indeed, the more deeply the Lynds’ representative community is probed
                    for signs of representativeness, the more the claim unravels. Historian Richard Jensen has noted,
                    for example, that of all American cities of <placeName>

                    and marginalization of "ethnics"-were rare indeed. Perhaps not surprisingly, such recognition came
                    only from those closely linked to surveyors’ old terrain of "social problems": religious and social

                    the other hand, many reviewers (including this last one) remarked upon and critiqued the Lynds’

                    rural county devoted to a staple crop and traditionalized by a black belt history and psychology."
                    Such a historically, economically, and of course, racially distinctive community, it seemed clear,

                    reconsideration of cultural habits and attitudes. But as the 1930s progressed and the Depression
                    took its course, the purportedly average American lifestyle that the Lynds described in their survey
                    was slowly revalued, taking on a different, more generous cast. This was most apparent in national

                <p>The tone of such reviews had changed, however, between the first study and the second. If
                    Middletowners were often a target of reviewers’ scorn in 1929, by 1937 some commentators were
                    praising the modal American found in the Lynds’ pages. There were those who wondered, in fact, if

                    </placeName> as an ostrich with its head in the sand, the commentator was reassured by their

                <p>In a period rife with international tensions, the commonality of the American people and their
                    beliefs, as documented by the Lynds, could also be marshaled politically. "What Herr Goebbels does

                    achieved symbolic purchase in the culture at large. Moreover, in some quarters it was being treated

                <p>Middletowners’ status as typical Americans might have put them in a unique position to challenge that
                    designation. But for all the uneasiness of residents, and despite their rejection of some of the
                    Lynds’ findings, something of the allure of the typical seeped into the terms of their arguments.
                    Local reaction to the <hi rend="i">Life</hi> photo-shoot is instructive on this score. Initially,
                    many in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been flattered by the attentions of a famous photographer. However, Bourke-White's
                    supposedly definitive portrait would stir up plenty of controversy in the city it was meant to
                    represent. As one of the Lynds’ correspondents related after the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> issue hit the stands, <hi rend="i">Life</hi> magazine had "the town mad as anything."
                    He speculated that <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                        </placeName> in Transition</hi> was meeting a better reception from locals than he had expected,
                    but only "because they have a new villain, Margaret Bourke-White." Another would report that "the
                    LIFE pictures were vigorously resented here, by practically everybody."<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

                <p>What about the photographs had riled people? In eleven pages of images, two in particular-which

                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> residents objected to this depiction of class differences, the stark presentation of
                    the shabby one-room shack in "Shedtown" aside the opulent parlor of the Ball family. One man
                    described Bourke-White's approach this way: "she ‘shot’ the upper crust and the lower (soaked)
                    crust, but left out the middle filling, which is the most important part of any community-pie."

                <p>Sensitive about their portrayal in the Lynds’ surveys, many townspeople saw in Bourke-White's
                    photographs yet another distortion of themselves and their community. But if the furor over <hi

                    awkwardness of being under the investigator's microscope, it was more deeply rooted in the strange
                    slippage between the typical and the good, the average and the ideal. As we have seen, the two
                    concepts had merged in much of the national coverage of <hi rend="i">

                            <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                        </placeName> Morning Star</hi> anticipated that Bourke-White's photographs would demonstrate

                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> was not only the most typical, but also the "best city of any its size." Just as the
                    Lynds’ critical account of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s ever-widening gap between working and business people had been lost in the rush to
                    uphold average America, Bourke-White's documentation of social differences was critiqued as
                    showcasing "extremes." The typical, at least in its idealized form, could not countenance the hard
                    facts of class and poverty in <placeName>

                </p>
                <p>In fact, the convergence of norms and ideals in the "representative community" had begun very early
                    in the study's career, blurring scientific and common sense understandings of the typical. The very
                    first mention of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> survey in local papers in 1924 announced that the researchers had chosen <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> for their investigation "because of its being a typical American city, devoid of a
                    large foreign population and having diversified industries and interests." This was of course
                    already a misreading of the Lynds’ project, but it was not an uncommon one. The claim, usually with
                    a touch of pride, to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s typicality-often conflated with its being predominantly native-born-was a recurring
                    theme in local reportage of the studies. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Chamber of Commerce, for instance, declared itself honored to represent "the most
                    typical American City." It then went on to proclaim in its promotional materials that the community
                    had been "selected as the ideal American City," and even mounted a sign on Main Street reading: "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>: The Ideal American City." This fusing of the typical and the ideal involved more than
                    a booster's sleight of hand. It demonstrated the ease by which "middleness" or typicality was
                    becoming a worthy aspiration, <list type="footnotes">

                    what it represented was less an empirically typical place than an ideologically-loaded argument

                    the materials used most heavily by researchers, students, and the media. Several strong collections,

                <p>John Purdue is best known for his gift that made possible Indiana's landgrant university. But how he
                    actually spent his life as a merchant and American capitalist is told in great detail by Robert C.
                    Kriebel in his 2002 biography, <hi rend="i">The Midas of the <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                        </placeName>.</hi> Not only does Kriebel detail Purdue's hard work, accomplishments, and public
                    beneficence, but he also reveals his subject's lack of tact, his moodiness, and his notable
                    generosity.</p>
                <p>Purdue was a mentor for many young and aspiring businessmen, some of whom were his business partners,
                    others simply young men he bankrolled. He also had a special affinity for children, whom he often
                    treated to candy and ice cream and took on long, chaperoned buggy rides.</p>
                <p>Purdue used his hard-earned wealth to benefit his community and his state in many ways. For example,
                    he not only served on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s first school board, but in the absence of tax funds to support the schools, he used
                    his own money to keep them open. For all of his generosity, Purdue (despite his early, brief
                    experience as a grammar school teacher), knew little about higher education and much less about
                    establishing a university, though he liked to think he did. Two of the stipulations accompanying his
                    gift for a land-grant college were that it be called Purdue University in perpetuity and that he
                    serve on the board of trustees for the remainder of his life.</p>
                <p>Kriebel has done a masterful job of research. He successfully delves into Purdue's occupational
                    environment and political activities. For example, Purdue once bought a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> daily newspaper for a personal <pb n="287" id="VAA4025-101-3-083"/> campaign vehicle in
                    his unsuccessful bid for a seat in Congress. He also invested in a gold mine, as well as an early
                    Indiana railroad, and he owned a large farm near West <placeName>
                        <country reg="le">Lebanon</country>
                    </placeName>. He established the Purdue Rifles, a military unit that saw Civil War action under a
                    100-day commitment.</p>
                <p>Following the end of the war and his temporary residency in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where a Purdue-for-Congress movement sprang to life. Persuaded by his friends, Purdue
                    ran for Congress, though his naivete in matters political was monumental. Kriebel documents Purdue's
                    accomplishments and portrays his personality as well.</p>
                <p>For the student of Indiana history, <hi rend="i">The Midas of the <placeName>

                <p>American writer Ambrose Bierce holds particular interest for students of Indiana history because,
                    while he was born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, he was living in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, when the Civil War broke out. He joined the 9th Indiana Volunteer Infantry
                    and saw action in many of the major battles of the war-Chickamauga, Pickett's Mill, Missionary
                    Ridge, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His experience earned him fifteen commendations and, arguably, a career. After the war
                    he became a journalist and made his reputation, in part, by writing disagreeably, but honestly,
                    about his experiences as a soldier and as a civilian. Bierce was one of the few American writers to
                    have served in active combat, and he was one of an even smaller number who refused to <pb n="288"
                        id="VAA4025-101-3-084"/> glorify, romanticize, or in any way extol what had been a bloody, often
                    barbaric war.</p>
                <p>It was after he was snapped up by William <placeName>

                    satire became legendary. While his greatest legacy remains his first-hand accounts of the horrors of
                    war-horrors so grievous that they meld into tales of the supernatural-he is today most remembered
                    for a single short story, "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" that continues to appear in literary
                    anthologies, including most recently <hi rend="i">Tales of Soldiers and Civilians,</hi> edited by
                    Donald Blume (2004).</p>
                <p>Readers at all familiar with Bierce might wonder why another publication of these particular tales is
                    necessary. A collection of this name has been published several times, including a 2000 edition that
                    included other stories. The answer lies almost exclusively in Blume's introduction. The editor
                    writes of his efforts in reassembling these nineteen tales that "In the preparation of this edition,
                    for each story six physical texts were considered: the original newspaper text, the edited paste-up
                    copytext to the 1892 text, the 1892 text, the 1898 text, the edited copytext to the 1909 text, and
                    the 1909 text." Blume feels that he has made a thorough study of Bierce's intentions and has thus
                    provided readers with the definitive version of the original collection. Given that the 1898 version
                    included extra stories (for a total of 22), and the 1909 version contained 26, the fact that Blume
                    has reverted to the original 19 is commendable. Blume's edition also surpasses the 2000 edition,
                    published by Penguin Classics, by including an original story that was excluded in the latter. All
                    to the good. Where Blume will lose the general readership, however, is in his heroic but
                    excruciating attention to the smallest details of grammar and punctuation. For example, "Again
                    seeking to follow Bierce's intentions, many more colons appear in this edition than in the 1892 and
                    later collections" (p. xxviii).</p>
                <p>But then, the general reader is not Blume's intended audience. In his introduction he comments in
                    detail upon Bierce's "artfully constructed plots that function on two different levels for two
                    different groups of readers, which we can denote the informed and the uninformed." Presumably, those
                    in the latter category will miss the nuances of this new collection. And so, although Blume's
                    introduction is useful to serious students of Bierce, this volume has a limited audience, and
                    whether it fills any "void in American literature," as the cover claims, is debatable.</p>
                <p>Similarly, the casual reader will find little of interest in <hi rend="i">A Much Misunderstood Man,
                        Selected Letters of Ambrose Bierce.</hi> Editors S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz have selected
                    slightly more than 200 letters from among Bierce's prodigious correspondence. The problem is that,
                    while the editors <pb n="289" id="VAA4025-101-3-085"/> have provided voluminous notes that make the
                    otherwise indecipherable letters decipherable, they are not made entertaining or informative for any
                    but the most ardent student of a brief period in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName> literary history. The letters in this collection address and/or discuss, almost
                    exclusively, minor regional authors such as George Sterling, Charles <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> Stoddard, and Herman Scheffauer. While there are half a dozen or so letters addressed
                    to the likes of William <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> Hearst and H. L. Mencken, they do not suffice to interest any but the most limited
                    audience. Furthermore, most readers will find the subject matter of the letters to be rather
                    prosaic. As the editors themselves admit, "it is disappointing how infrequently Bierce discusses his
                    fiction in his letters." Given that Bierce is best known, and loved, for his short fiction, this is
                    indeed problematic. However, someone out there knows and cares about the minutiae of <placeName>

                <p>The Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s attained its greatest strength in Indiana, but the state was relatively
                    free of the violence that sometimes accompanied the rise of the Invisible Empire elsewhere. The
                    rowdy confrontation that took place between robed Klansmen attending a tristate gathering in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> and aroused Notre Dame students was an exception. The skirmishes that occurred on May
                    17 and 19, 1924, resulted in a few minor injuries and arrests but a large number of bruised egos on
                    both sides.</p>
                <p>Todd Tucker, a professional writer whose work has appeared in several national magazines, has put
                    together an engaging account of this <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> "riot." He succeeds in placing the event in a broad framework that includes the origins
                    and development of both the Klan and Notre Dame. He provides absorbing biographical sketches of
                    Notre Dame founder Father Edward Sorin; Father Matthew Walsh, Notre Dame president at the time of
                    the disturbances; the university's legendary football coach Knute Rockne; and David C. Stephenson,
                    the infamous Grand Dragon whose unbridled lust culminated with the death of Madge Oberholtzer,
                    leading to his homicide conviction and the <pb n="290" id="VAA4025-101-3-086"/> collapse of the
                    Indiana Klan. Tucker skillfully weaves together these stories, and doubtless many will enjoy this
                    spirited account. As a scholarly work, however, the book falls short.</p>
                <p>A Hoosier and 1990 Notre Dame alumnus with an undergraduate degree in history, Tucker had heard
                    nothing during his college years about the 1924 riot or about the influence that the Klan,
                    "Indiana's family secret," (p. xxi) once wielded. In his subsequent effort to learn more, he
                    consulted secondary works, examined documents from Notre Dame archives, looked at contemporary <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Klan press accounts, and interviewed two surviving riot participants. In his
                    prologue, however, he discloses that for "the sake of the story, I have taken a great liberty" (p.
                    xxiii). In particular he assigns thoughts and feelings to key figures, creates a composite character
                    to serve as a central focal point, and has "extrapolated historical events in order to bring out the
                    drama of the situation" (p. xxiii). As he explains throughout his end notes, he fabricates details,
                    dialogue, and speeches (or sometimes presents them in inaccurate contexts).</p>
                <p>Despite this, the author's speculations often seem plausible, and he is fair-minded in assessing the
                    Klan's broad appeal to so many Indiana Protestants. As a Catholic convert, Tucker is sympathetic
                    towards the Notre Dame students’ outrage at the Klan's virulent anti-Catholicism, but acknowledges
                    that these skirmishes appeared at the time to confirm the ruffian Irish Catholic stereotype and
                    brought some embarrassment to Father Walsh, Notre Dame, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s sizable Catholic community. Indeed, the book's subtitle is something of a misnomer,
                    since the riot constituted an immediate propaganda coup for the Klan, and made little contribution
                    to the Indiana Klan's precipitous decline over the next few years.</p>
                <p>The Notre Dame triumph that Tucker outlines stemmed from the remarkable successes of its football
                    team under Rockne's celebrated leadership. The team's championships offset the Klan's denunciation
                    of Catholics, and "offered proof that the University of Notre Dame and Catholic institutions of
                    learning in general could mold successful Americans" (p. 188). Notre Dame would emerge as the
                    nation's premier Catholic institution of higher learning, while Catholics, particularly Irish
                    Catholics, would eventually attain social and political influence, as symbolized by the 1960
                    election of John E Kennedy (although Tucker errs in suggesting that the Catholic Church became the
                    nation's largest denomination after the Notre Dame riot, when in fact it had reached this position
                    by the mid-1800s).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="i">Notre Dame vs. the Klan</hi> has serious flaws. The research could have been more
                    extensive, the methodology more rigorous, and higher value might have been placed on historical
                    accuracy. A comparison of the South <pb n="291" id="VAA4025-101-3-087"/> Bend incident with

                <p>Incorporating "Mad" into the title for this volume is perhaps metaphorically overdrawn. To be sure,
                    the movement was at times frenzied, even irrational, motivated by the need and desire of hundreds of
                    families seeking to establish themselves on farms in this new West. This possibility became even
                    more desirable as news trickled back east about the rich soil of <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s bluegrass region.</p>
                <p>The volume's lengthy introduction, approximately one-fourth of the text, is a review sketch of the
                    early settlement of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, including the routes the settlers took and the dangers and obstacles they confronted
                    on their journies. The body of the book consists of excerpts from thirteen travel accounts, dating
                    from 1775 to 1796. Anyone who has used early travel accounts as primary source materials for
                    historical research, or has read them in their edited and published forms, knows that they are often
                    rich lodes of descriptions, observations, <pb n="292" id="VAA4025-101-3-088"/> and opinions that

                <p>Long a story with a grip on the American imagination, the history of the Underground Railroad (UGRR)
                    has recently attracted intensified interest. Programs like Conner <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s <hi rend="i">Follow the North Star</hi> and the opening of the National Underground
                    Railroad Freedom Center in <placeName>

                    </placeName> attest to this renewed focus on the story. With this renewal has come a needed
                    reappraisal.</p>
                <p>Much early work on the UGRR centered on white "conductors" (perhaps in some part as an exercise in
                    expatiation of white guilt over slavery) or attempted to identify houses that were "stations" along
                    the circuitous pathway to freedom. Historians and restorationists soon realized that if every house
                    with a basement or hidden room which adherents claim once hid fleeing slaves actually performed that
                    noble function, the South would have been emptied of the victims of the "peculiar institution."</p>
                <p>Keith P. Grifflers important, wellwritten account, <hi rend="i">Front Line of Freedom: African
                        Americans and the Forging of the Underground Railroad in the <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                        </placeName> Valley,</hi> is part of welcome recent efforts to focus on the role of African
                    Americans in the UGRR. "African American fugitives who were whisked away," he notes, "… were no more
                    than minor characters" (p. 3) in many previous tellings. This "received tradition" of viewing the
                    UGRR through the prism of the white experience ignored the fact that it was "an interracial movement
                    … [that] took the form of white activists working not alone but in concert with African American
                    communities" (p. 8). With black participants’ stories spotlighted, Griffler aptly likens the UGRR to
                    underground resistance movements that spring up among subjugated peoples elsewhere. In this case the
                    front line was not occupied <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> of World War II, but the areas along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River where predatory slave hunters (often working handin-hand with local authorities)
                    shared the landscape with freedom-seeking African Americans.</p>
                <p>As an example, Griffler relates how Francis Scroggins, a free northern black woman, whisked away an
                    escaping female slave with her master on their heels. Scroggins later led her charge out the back
                    door of a safe house as the angry slave owner tried to break down the front door. Such efforts were
                    white-hot sparks of controversy in river communities, and the author ably profiles the tension-and
                    sometimes the violence-that the UGRR engendered. The book also discusses those who went "behind
                    enemy lines," the Midwest's own Harriet Tubmans. Individually or in groups, these interracial
                    "special forces" went into the South to rescue slaves, often with the active support of the enslaved
                    in the area.</p>
                <p>Griffler does not diminish the important work of whites in the movement. As he points out, the UGRR
                    was a smart, organized effort carried out by people of both races. Perhaps the best known white
                    leader, <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-101-3-090"/> one who long symbolized the movement, is Levi Coffin,
                    "president of the Underground Railroad." Coffin's <hi rend="i">Reminiscences</hi> forms part of
                    another new book about the UGRR, <hi rend="i">Fleeing for Freedom: Stories of the Underground
                        Railroad.</hi> Edited by George and Willene Hendrick, the book abridges Coffin's famous work
                    along with William Still's <hi rend="i">The Underground Railroad,</hi> both seminal texts. The
                    Hendricks’ introduction provides a valuable overview of the UGRR and of the lives of Coffin and
                    Still.</p>
                <p>Coffin's <hi rend="i">Reminiscences</hi> is, of course, an important work from which grew much of the
                    public's perception of the movement. In it, Coffin traces his commitment to abolitionism and his
                    involvement in the UGRR. He also tells the often heartbreaking stories of the escaping slaves,
                    including the about-to-be-captured Margaret Garner, who killed her own child rather than "see it
                    taken back to slavery" (p. 91). The editors’ deft condensation of the 700-pluspage work retains its
                    essence while making it more accessible.</p>
                <p>Less well-known than Coffin, William Still was the son of former slaves, a successful <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> businessman, and a skilled organizer of the UGRR in the East. He kept notes of his
                    activities and the people he encountered, and they formed the basis for his book, originally
                    published in 1872. Prominence in this abridged version is given to the "Christiana tragedy" in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, including the killing of a pursuing slaveowner and the ensuing "treason" trial, but
                    the work also contains smaller, more personal stories. Among them is the fascinating tale of Ellen
                    Craft, who escaped bondage in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> by disguising herself as a white planter and bringing her husband William along as her
                    servant. The Crafts eventually migrated to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, where they taught in an agricultural school before returning to America to establish a

                <p>Taken together, these works, one old, one new, shed light on the African American experience in the
                    Underground Railroad.</p>

                    that the railroad had achieved its destiny and had no need to reach farther afield. Its motto, "The

                    </placeName> and Alton, and by doing so provides a case study of how not to succeed in business, at
                    least not in the highly competitive business of nineteenth-century railroads. The twentieth century
                    saw the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Alton stumbling along financially, confined by poor earlier decisions to one of the

                    railroad. Physically, this is a beautiful volume, with numerous illustrations to amplify the text.
                    There are not only many photographs of locomotives, but also several that detail the creation of the
                    railroad landscape, and there are maps and advertisements. Glendinning excels at detailing how the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Alton acquired its component lines, and then examines its failure to reach beyond
                    its relatively small and comfortable place in the <pb n="296" id="VAA4025-101-3-092"/> nation's
                    heartland, as its successful competitors did. As Glendinning observes of President Timothy
                    Blackstone in the late 1880s: "After the push to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> City, he added virtually no new mileage. Nor did he add new traffic by taking over
                    weaker, troublesome short lines. He was content to dominate the relatively limited territory he
                    controlled and leave to others the pursuit of-in his opinion-unwise and unbridled expansion.

                    <hi rend="i">From Small Town to Downtown A History of the Jewett Car Company,</hi> 1893-1919, By
                    Lawrence A. Brough and James H. Graebner, (<placeName>

                    index. $49.95.)</head>
                <p>The Jewett Car Company, established in 1893 in Jewett, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, built cars for interurbans, street railways, and rapid transit lines. Seeking a higher
                    profile, more extensive facilities, and wider markets, the owners moved the company to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newark</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1900. The life of the company mirrored the trajectory of U.S. interurban and street
                    railway systems; it closed up shop in 1919 after several years of rapidly declining production.
                    While many of the cars produced by Jewett were destined for the country's largest cities, Indiana
                    lines were notable among the list of customers.</p>
                <p>Those looking for a full-blown history of the company will not find it here, however. Approximately
                    80 amply illustrated pages of history (totaling only about 30 pages of text) are followed by some
                    170 pages of additional photographs, appendices, references, and index. The authors assume that
                    readers know a fair amount about both midwestern interurban history and the history of car building,
                    so the narrative is adequate, but not definitive. It is also uneven. For example, they devote
                    excessive space to a list of inventions patented by William Wright, Jewett Car Company president for
                    most of the life of the firm, while more significant issues, such as an aborted merger of car
                    manufacturing <pb n="297" id="VAA4025-101-3-093"/> companies, are treated sketchily.</p>
                <p>The book's main defect is its lack of footnotes or endnotes. In the introduction to the appendices,
                    the authors state, "as any researcher knows, when digging into the distant past, conflicting
                    information is often found, making it nearly impossible to determine the true facts" (p. 101).
                    Unfortunately, they neither clarify how they resolved conflicts nor provide their readers a road
                    map-in the form of appropriate documentation-to find those conflicts and be able to reach their own
                    conclusions. Anyone whose interest is piqued by a particular quotation or statistic receives little
                    guidance about reading or researching further, other than to try to choose likely sources from the
                    extensive bibliography and cover ground presumably already covered by the authors. In addition,
                    where the authors cite specific archival or manuscript collections in the references, they provide
                    no date, series title, box number, or other standard citation details.</p>
                <p>It is also unclear what criteria the authors used in deciding which photographs to reproduce in the
                    text and which to place in the chapter titled "Photo Album." One example of the confusion this
                    causes: The University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> "test car" is described and its exterior illustrated on page 27, but its interior is
                    not pictured until page 97, as part of the "Photo Album." Many other photographs are placed
                    seemingly at random, with no corresponding references in the text.</p>
                <p>The primary value of this book, then, is the information in the "Appendix," which is divided into
                    four sections: Table 1, "Roster of Cars Made by the Jewett Car Company"; Table 2, "SurvivingJewett
                    Lot Lists"; Table 3, "Cost Information"; and a fourth titled "Research Data on Cars Manufactured by
                    the Jewett Car Company, 1893-1919." These lists are invaluable to transit aficionados, owners of
                    surviving Jewett cars, and those researching the economic history of car production.</p>

                    the relevance of local aviation organizations, digesting for the reader the significance of federal
                    regulations in the business of carrying the mail and building airlines-to show how <placeName>

                    </placeName> became an "[a]irport to a nation" (p. 133). This local aviation history, however,
                    expands the genre. Young explains how the geography, the existing transportation infrastructure, and
                    capital resources of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    the city's importance to the history of the national transportation system.</p>
                <p>Young documents the role of balloonists and private citizens, such as Wright brothers’ mentor Octave
                    Chanute, in developing Chicagoans’ aeronautical awareness at the turn of the century. In the years
                    following the Wright brothers’ famous flights at Kitty Hawk, <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s most aviation-minded people aimed to turn their city into an international center of
                    aeronautical activity. Air shows sponsored by the Aero Club of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, established in 1910, brought flyers from all over the world to a city famed for its
                    railroad and manufacturing industries. Club members, many of them wealthy and influential <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>-based businessmen as well as pilots, developed the city's first airports. The
                    combination of the Club's advocacy and monetary contributions made <placeName>

                    Office between 1925 and 1930. By the mid-1930s, airline corporations had usurped the Aero Club's
                    role as arbiter of public relations. Young's chapter on air safety provides a rare look at how the
                    fledgling airlines spent capital downplaying their accidents while railroad passenger services,
                    already in decline, attempted to use this bad news to their advantage. The innovation of the jet
                    airplane pushed the railroad passenger business further to the side and overcrowded <placeName>

                        </placeName> Radiation Tests</hi>, By Martha Stephens, (Durham, N. C,: Duke University Press,

                    University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>

                    1972. Patients tended to be poor, and sixty percent were African American. All died, most before the
                    term indicated by regular diagnosis. They were human subjects in one of a series of more than 4,000
                    such experiments funded by the Department of Defense, the National Institutes of Health, and other
                    federal agencies.</p>
                <p>Martha Stephens divides her account into three sections: discovery and public knowledge of the
                    hitherto semi-secret experiments; case studies of selected families; and legal issues and trial.
                    Stephens learned of the radiation experiments about the time they were being concluded, in 1974. As
                    a member of the Junior Faculty Associates at the university, she began her investigations because
                    she felt that "what had happened … touched me directly" (p. 8). "It seemed to me then," she writes,
                    "and it seems to me now, that we had become a secret slaughterhouse, a secret death camp" (pp. 8-9).
                    Her horror and outrage inform the whole book. The author does not offer a history of whole-body
                    radiation, nor an analysis of oncology from the 1970s onward. There is no broad perspective.</p>
                <p>In the early cold war period restrictions upon human subject scientific experiments were fluid. The
                    subjects of these experiments were <pb n="300" id="VAA4025-101-3-096"/> generally poorly educated,
                    economically disadvantaged, and unaware of the dangers of massive radiological dosages. Informed
                    consent was nonexistent: verbal assent was sufficient. Dr. Eugene Saenger, the principal
                    investigator, was a respected radiologist. Officials of the American College of Radiology, who
                    investigated the program in 1972, found no fault in its procedures or results. In this same time
                    period, however, Stephens and her colleagues began to investigate these experiments, and then to
                    agitate for publicity about them. Her frustration with what she regards as the inattention paid to
                    their findings shines through her writing. She uses a colleague's statement to open chapter five:
                    "In my own mind, this project borders on what happened at Auschwitz."</p>
                <p>Some of us of a certain age can recall the irradiated dimes we received when the Atomic Energy
                    Exhibit came to town to tout what the later Eisenhower administration would term "Atoms for Peace."
                    We were told that radioactive tracers in the blood would improve medical diagnostics; that food
                    preservation through irradiation would prevent world hunger and starvation; and that new products
                    would flow from the cornucopia of physics and chemistry. Humans became commodities in the process.</p>
                <p>In theory, massive radiation therapies might have proven useful in combating cancer. During the cold
                    war period, when so many other threats loomed over the nation, nuclear tests, militarization of most
                    sciences, and concern for national security research goals led to a cavalier attitude towards
                    research involving human subjects. When some of the affected families finally had their day in
                    court, in the 1990s, their internal squabbling prevented definitive closure. For some families money
                    was important; most wanted an apology from the doctors for the wrongs done.</p>
                <p>In 1994 President Bill Clinton appointed an Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments
                    (ACHRE). The final report, which offers a broad look at the studies and the rationale behind them,
                    was issued in the hope that the legacy of distrust would disappear. But the secrecy lives on-some
                    sections of that final report have recently been reclassified and are unavailable.</p>

                <p>In 1789 Thomas Coke opened the Methodist Book Concern, "the first publishing house in America to
                    initiate the systematic printing and distribution of evangelical books" (p. 46). Nearly one hundred
                    years later Harper &amp; Brothers, a trade press with Methodist roots, published Indiana native

                    </placeName> defines nineteenth-century evangelicals as Christians who rejected both sacramental
                    theology and liberal rationalistic theology in favor of a theology centered on "the Word," that is,
                    the Bible. Thus, words became a powerful tool in fulfilling the evangelicals’ mission of purifying
                    the world and made their entrance into the publishing profession a natural step.</p>

                    </placeName> posits the existence of an "evangelical textual community" (p. 9) based on a network of
                    nationally distributed books that promoted evangelical cultural values and connected geographically
                    scattered Christians. She examines the composition and function of this "textual community,"
                    highlighting both the success of evangelicals in disseminating their ideas and the tensions inherent
                    in their efforts. She closes by linking nineteenth-century evangelical publishing to its modern
                    counterpart, the vibrant media culture of twenty-first-century Christianity.</p>
                <p>Two tensions <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> documents illustrate especially well the evangelical dilemma of striving for purity and
                    unity in a fallen world. One conflict involved the pull between loyalty to a denomination and
                    loyalty to a "universal church" of like-minded believers. Evangelical publishers contributed to this
                    tension. On the one hand, denominational presses strengthened church ties by publishing
                    controversial doctrinal work that was compatible with their particular set of beliefs but which
                    heightened sectarian divisions. On the other hand, nondenominational publishing houses and
                    evangelical trade publishers unified their audience by marketing books acceptable to most
                    evangelicals: Bibles, devotionals, biblical commentaries, hymnals, history, memoirs, and eventually
                    fiction. Over time, a core group of these texts evolved into a distinctive "evangelical canon."</p>
                <pb n="302" id="VAA4025-101-3-098"/>
                <p>Readers embraced this evangelical canon, evidenced by the number of books they bought, and this
                    market success led to a second important tension within the evangelical world. Some publishers
                    eschewed the "commercialization" of evangelical literature, fearing that financial success
                    undermined their ability to influence the world. Most, however, saw that bigger sales meant a wider
                    exposure for evangelical ideas, and they adopted secular business principles as a way to help them
                    spread their message.</p>

                    stereotypical portrayal of evangelicals as anti-intellectual and otherworldly. Indeed, evangelicals
                    were not afraid to engage popular culture to reach the "masses" and purify society. They maintained
                    a holistic approach to life in which every action-including reading, writing, and publishing-served
                    a godly purpose. Thus, concludes <placeName>

                    </placeName>, evangelicals’ experience of religion went beyond altar calls and tent revivals to a
                    lifelong commitment to changing the world through the power of words.</p>

                <p>Constantine Samuel Rafinesque was arguably the oddest naturalist of his time. In the early nineteenth
                    century he knew as much botany, zoology, and history as most men in those fields, and he published
                    works on archaeology, linguistics, medicine, and banking as well. So how did this gifted man, a kind
                    of walking curiosity museum, manage to outrage so many of his scientific contemporaries? Leonard <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>'s biography of Rafinesque seeks to answer this question, and to further rehabilitate
                    his scientific reputation. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> does a fine job of illuminating Rafinesque and his obsessive drive to find and
                    catalogue new species; what is more, the author examines in depth the troubling aspects of
                    Rafinesque's character and work.</p>
                <p>A great part of the book re-creates Rafinesque's world in the early nineteenth century, particularly
                    the world <pb n="303" id="VAA4025-101-3-099"/> of science. Rafinesque, a European immigrant to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, trekked through the eastern portion of his adopted country hoping to make scientific
                    discoveries, build a reputation, and gain a professorship. In botany and zoology, as <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> shows, Rafinesque did much sound work (acknowledged later by both Louis Agassiz and
                    Charles Darwin). Yet as a collector in the field, his tendency was to create new species rather than
                    lump them together under existing ones, thus often bringing taxonomic chaos to these sciences. A
                    certain amount of controversy is to be expected in any field flooded with new specimens, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> argues that Rafinesque often behaved no worse than other investigators of his time, but
                    what infuriated many powerful scientists of the day was his harsh criticism of anyone who disagreed
                    with him. Rafinesque made enemies, then seemed completely baffled when so many scientists disparaged
                    him or refused to publish his work. He thus often sabotaged his own efforts, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>, an M.D., offers a modern-day medical opinion of why this might have been so:
                    Rafinesque probably suffered from chronic hypomania. As a result, he took criticism poorly, and
                    often let his imagination outstrip the evidence of his observations, in one case even producing
                    fraudulent work. Thus for his contemporaries, Rafinesque was troublesome, wrong-headed, infuriating,
                    unreliable, and a nuisance to science. He particularly irked Thomas Say, who several times had to
                    retract some of the "new" species found on the Long Expedition because Rafinesque previously, if
                    hastily, had described them. No doubt this animosity was one reason Rafinesque refused to join Say
                    and other scientists at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, when William Maclure invited him to live in that Utopian community in the
                    late 1820s.</p>
                <p>Despite his failings, Rafinesque was in some ways ahead of his time. He invented and promoted an
                    enlightened banking system aimed at helping the working man. He opposed slavery in all its forms,
                    and he championed Native Americans. And although not a trained physician, he dispensed reasonable
                    medical advice and sold botanical cures that certainly were safer (if not more effective) than most
                    of the harsh chemical medicines then in standard use. When Rafinesque taught for seven years at
                    Transylvania University in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, one of his few safe havens, he impressed many students with his knowledge and lively
                    lecturing. Little wonder that over the last century some scientists have reevaluated his work in
                    their specialties and have come to appreciate its merit.</p>
                <p>This biography's greatest strength, however, lies in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>'s reappraisal of not just some specialties but <hi rend="i">all</hi> of Rafinesque's

                    drawbacks in the work-by covering so much background for so many subjects <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> often disrupts the narrative flow, leaving one hungrier for more of Rafinesque and less
                    of his times. Still, the reader comes away from this work satisfied that Rafinesque at last has
                    found the biographer he deserves, one with sympathy for his subject, yet able to evaluate his
                    shortcomings fairly and judiciously. <placeName>

                <p>In <hi rend="i">Women at the Front</hi> Jane E. Schultz significantly enriches the scholarship
                    surrounding women nurses of the Civil War. Her ambitious study of Union and Confederate caregivers
                    dispels traditional myths that portray these women as superhuman, selfsacrificing embodiments of
                    white middle-class morality. In the first part of her work, Schultz establishes the broad panorama
                    of women's experiences as hospital workers. In the second, she examines how wartime experiences
                    affected women in the aftermath of the conflict. Schultz traces women's adjustments to peacetime
                    society, their struggles for pensions, and finally, the vast array of their narratives.</p>
                <p>The author's investigation of the implications of social class, race, and region sheds new light on
                    these women who have largely escaped historians’ notice. Analyzing Union hospital records collected
                    in 1890 for some 21,000 female workers, Schultz develops a general nursing profile: assignments as
                    nurses and matrons were given primarily to white middle-class women, while workingclass, immigrant,
                    and black women (both free and slave) often performed duties more like those of domestic service
                    workers. Social class thus helped to exclude all but about 6,000 out of 21,000 women workers in
                    Union hospitals from eligibility for the 1892 Army Nurses Pension Act. <pb n="305"
                        id="VAA4025-101-3-101"/> Race was an even stronger factor, for among the 2,000 women identified
                    by hospital records, only one black woman is known to have received a nurse's pension. Racial
                    tensions in Union hospitals and camps were high, and contraband runaway slave women were especially
                    subject to abuse.</p>
                <p>Confederate nurses were legally ineligible for the federal plan. During the war, social class
                    differences had been the primary factor in work assignments in Confederate hospitals. A few socially
                    privileged leaders like Mary Livermore felt empowered by their Civil War experiences, but Schultz
                    demonstrates that after the war the vast majority of women nurses, North and South, struggled with
                    the realities of poverty and race.</p>
                <p>In the last section of the book, Schultz's comprehensive survey of women's written accounts of their
                    nursing experiences raises intriguing questions about narrative voice, sectional bitterness, and
                    changing gender roles. In a study so comprehensive and vast, however, omissions and occasional
                    overstatements seem inevitable. Schultz's discussion of how women received nursing appointments
                    gives little attention to the conflicting roles of state sanitary commissions, the U. S. Sanitary
                    Commission, and the Christian Commission. Given the popularity of Florence Nightingale's textbook on
                    nursing and the practice of home nursing that included knowledge of homeopathic medicine, perhaps
                    she too quickly concludes that few women had useful training. While few statistics identify the
                    number of women who died as a result of their service, the author might give more attention to the
                    women who sacrificed their lives.</p>
                <p>For students of Indiana history, Schultz's omission of the role played by the state sanitary
                    commission, one of the most active in the Union, is disappointing. Future studies could also include
                    the work of Dr. Chloe Annette Buckel, nurse trainer at the gigantic Jefferson General Hospital in <placeName>

                    nurses, pioneer physician and women's rights leader Dr. Mary Frame Thomas of <placeName>

                    remain invisible.</p>
                <p>Jane Schultz is to be commended nevertheless for an excellent study of the women who played crucial
                    roles in a war that still has continuing legacies. While not detracting from the heroic efforts of

                    and of bitter sectional divisions that have continued to fester into the twentyfirst century.
                    Schultz's comprehensive study is essential reading for an understanding of women's contributions to
                    the Civil War and to our nation.</p>

                    Logue, (<placeName>

                <p>One of Michael Barton's and Larry Logue's primary goals in assembling these twenty-seven articles and
                    chapters is to introduce the non-professional reader to the past twenty-five years of Civil War
                    research. Some earlier writings are also included by way of points of departure or foils for the
                    newer scholarship. The focus is entirely on the ordinary soldier, and rarely are generals or
                    politicians mentioned. The editors summarize their five-fold organization of the volume under the
                    headings: "Who the soldiers were, how they lived, how they fought, how they felt, and what they
                    believed" (p. 2).</p>
                <p>In the introduction, the editors articulate their own scholarly predisposition. "In our own research
                    we have been deeply interested in one overarching question: What were the essential social,
                    cultural, and even psychological differences between Union and Confederate soldiers?" (p. 3). To
                    bring out some of these differences, they include Logue's own contribution on the efforts to recruit
                    young men in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. Unlike Northerners, these Mississippians were overwhelmingly preoccupied with
                    "society's racial equilibrium: the fear of life with the bottom rail on top echoes through soldiers’
                    explanations of why they were in the army" (p. 44). Logue also makes us aware of the reluctance of
                    Southern youth who lived in the counties along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> River to sign up for military service. As often as not, they would disappear west of
                    the River.</p>
                <p>Reinforcing the notion of distinctiveness within the Confederate Army is an older (1957) but most
                    welcome article by David Donald. "The distinctive thing about the Confederate army," he writes, "is
                    that Southern soldiers never truly accepted <pb n="307" id="VAA4025-101-3-103"/> the idea that
                    discipline is necessary to the effective functioning of a fighting force" (p. 176). Donald describes
                    the prewar lives of many young Southern farmers, craftsmen, and gentry who were set in their ways,
                    acted independently, and were ardent individualists.</p>
                <p>In contrast to these articles which stress distinctions between Union and Confederate soldiers,
                    however, there are as many pieces in this collection which argue the opposite point: that Northern
                    and Southern troops had much in common. This approach is contained in several items by Bell Irvin
                    Wiley. Although writing about the life of the common soldier in the North, what Fred A. Shannon says
                    could equally be applied to the South: "The soldier, especially in the first year of the war, was
                    the victim of ignorant officers, of swindling contractors, and of unscrupulous Federal inspectors of
                    provisions" (p. 93). Time and again, within the various articles, the shared plight of soldiers is
                    brought out. They had to slog through mud, become soaked with rain, witness their ill-made uniforms
                    fall apart, and experience chronic hunger, to mention only a few common hardships.</p>
                <p>Union and Confederate troops also shared common reactions to combat. Fear often overcame them, but
                    many still managed to keep fighting. They continued to ask themselves why they joined the army, and
                    in their more thoughtful moments fell back on traditional values of patriotism, love of home and
                    family, and religious fervor. As content analysis is applied to soldiers’ diaries and letters to see
                    the emerging patterns, readers are exposed here, as elsewhere in this volume, to recent quantitative
                    approaches to the war.</p>
                <p>This is a fine collection which lends itself to classroom use and to the edification of
                    non-specialists. Somewhat puzzling is why the editors included all the notes from each article, thus
                    lengthening an already long book by many pages. Only two articles deal with the experience of black
                    soldiers, and though these are valuable, one might have wished for a few more. The clandestine
                    military service of women is nicely incorporated, but perhaps the many roles of women near the
                    battlefield and at home might have found a place. To be sure, the focus is on soldiers and battles,
                    but many men went on furlough whenever they could, and some of them just faded away. With an
                    estimated 200,000 deserters from the Union Army and a substantial number from the Confederate, the
                    editors might have paid more attention to the multiplicity of reasons why this phenomenon occurred.</p>

                <p>On the last day of February 1905, elderly dowager Jane <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName> cried out in the night, "This is a horrible death to die!" Linking her words to the
                    agonies of strychnine poisoning, Dr. Robert Cutler, once neurologist and pharmacologist at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName> University (now, most regrettably, deceased) reopened a one-hundred-year-old murder
                    investigation. The book has caused quite a stir, not only because of Cutler's conviction that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a victim of foul play, but because of his accompanying accusation of a cover-up

                <p>The story of Jane <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s demise has all the makings of a blockbuster popular history, for at each section of
                    each brief chapter there lies the opportunity to expand upon some observation or story. Cutler's
                    endnotes show his own instinct to follow from newspaper to archive each new twist in the drama, and
                    his judicious reservations about the stories that his main suspect, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s longtime handmaid and companion, Miss Bertha Berner, provided. Cutler nonetheless
                    finds proof of murder in the medical descriptions of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s last moments and her early postmortem appearance, descriptions provided by a group of
                    Honolulu physicians who were involved with the alarm, the inquest, and the autopsy. In particular,
                    medical testimony pointed to her tightly clenched fists, her turned, arched feet, and arms so rigid
                    that the undertaker had to reduce the contraction forcibly in order to disrobe the corpse. Further
                    clues of the distinctive progression of strychnine poisoning lie in Jane <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s words of agony to her female companions. An author dedicated to a larger audience
                    might have lingered longer over the frenzy in which medical and legal witnesses were assembled
                    through the early hours of March 1, how the private dining rooms of the hotel were used for the <hi
                        rend="i">inquisition post mortem,</hi> or indeed offered the reader more descriptive detail of
                    the way such investigations and declarations of unnatural death were made a century ago. Readers of
                    a longer version would want more of the fascinating toxicological and pharmacological detail pulled
                    from the notes to the text.</p>
                <p>Cutler's dedication to proving the crime reflects more a mission of delayed justice than it does
                    expose or sensationalism. He became convinced that Starr <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName>'s efforts to suppress a possibly extensive, expensive murder investigation involved <pb
                        n="309" id="VAA4025-101-3-105"/> unwarranted and nearly libelous characterization of the medical

                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s body. Thus it is Cutler's secondary purpose in this slender book to rehabilitate the
                    reputations of these men. His principal critique of <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> stems from the way the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName> University president used his power and position: insinuating the incompetence of the
                    Honolulu medical community in private correspondence, denying his agency when necessary, and
                    allowing newspaper reporters to do the dirty work. Cutler's profiles of the elite Honolulu medical
                    community form a composite picture of the range of medical careers attractive to this transitional
                    generation, when the promises of scientific medicine were far greater than its curative or
                    diagnostic successes.</p>
                <p>I found most convincing the repair work Cutler offered to these reputations, but I reserve skepticism
                    for the sketchy motivations offered to explain <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName>'s private campaigns to suppress the story and impugn the evidence of murder most foul.
                    Moreover, Cutler's conclusion that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName> could only have been poisoned is still more possible than likely. Medical records to
                    lend any clinical surety to the author's conviction that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName> was, before the poisonings, in robust good health have long since disappeared, if they
                    ever existed. (The routine modern measures of wellness, illness, and aging were not yet part of
                    health maintenance or monitoring.) The toxicological evidence from chemical analysis of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s body was far more ambivalent than Cutler wished it to be. The insecurity, even
                    near-chaos, of the crime scene presents a further difficulty that Cutler chose not to address
                    systematically. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName> earthquake and fire, the suppression of unhelpful <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName> family memorabilia by <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> and others: these are the accidents that Cutler points to when the murder trail goes
                    cold. Too much of what would truly convince the reader cannot be wrested from all these silences.
                    But this engaging little book does make us want to know more and to mourn the death of its author.
                    He writes with flair and honesty and above all tells a good story.</p>

                    people, our values, our culture, our natural resources, our faiths? All plausible, and partial,
                    answers. Legal scholar H. Jefferson Powell suggests another: our words, particularly the words of
                    our Constitution.</p>
                <p>Powell's rich and ambitious book covers impressive ground, twenty-one chapters devoted to a series of
                    constitutional controversies that span the years 1790 to 1944. Some controversies are relatively
                    familiar: the <hi rend="i">M'Culloch v. <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                        </placeName>
                    </hi> (1819) decision that upheld Congress's authority to establish a national bank and found
                    expansive congressional power to enact federal legislation, and the infamous <hi rend="i"
                    >Korematsu</hi> (1944) decision that upheld the wartime internment of more than one hundred thousand
                    Japanese Americans. In other chapters, Powell introduces readers to little-known constitutional
                    events of substantial import, such as an obscure period in 1808-1809 that he describes as "one of
                    the most important in the entire history of American constitutional law," in which a Supreme Court
                    Justice, a federal district court judge, and a President each made decisions that were politically
                    unpopular and contrary to personal preferences for the sake of fidelity to the law (p. 110).</p>
                <p>Whatever his subject, Powell provides fresh insights and perspectives, as when he compares successive
                    drafts of <hi rend="i">State v. Mann</hi> (1829), an important judicial decision regarding slavery.
                    Powell's choice of subjects is notable for its appreciation of the complexity of how we as a nation
                    resolve the meaning of the Constitution's words. He goes beyond the typical Supreme Court focus to
                    include interpretations by other actors, including state court judges and elected and appointed
                    government officials. Each section concludes with valuable contemporary lessons that follow from his
                    analysis of historical events.</p>
                <p>Powell presents a strong case for what he terms an "historicist" approach that recognizes
                    constitutional law as "thoroughly historical, dependent throughout on the contingencies of time and
                    political circumstances" (p. 7). He explodes the mythical ideas of law divorced from politics and a
                    bygone age of apolitical constitutional virtue. He establishes that American constitutionalism
                    always has been wracked with sharp, fundamental disagreement shaped by the politics of the time, an
                    especially timely analysis given current views that decry the politicization of the law and
                    misleadingly call forjudges who will not "legislate from the bench."</p>
                <pb n="311" id="VAA4025-101-3-107"/>
                <p>Powell contends that our twohundred-year tradition of constitutional controversy should be celebrated
                    and appreciated as a source of national strength. American constitutional law, while in some senses
                    inextricably political, also is deeply principled, as evidenced by the author's descriptions of
                    judges and political actors who adopted constitutional positions at odds with their personal
                    preferences and partisan interests. Constitutional law's "coherent tradition of argument" offers
                    "the means by which people of fundamentally different views, beliefs, origins, and visions can
                    become and remain a political community" (pp. 7, 213).</p>
                <p>The concluding chapter deserves a particularly careful read and close reflection. Drawing upon his
                    historicist analysis, Powell develops twenty "shared constitutional first principles" that have
                    gained wide acceptance over time as common ground for debate over less settled constitutional issues
                    (p. 205). While the author may be overly optimistic in his evaluation of the consensus behind one or
                    two of these principles, his approach is normatively attractive and provides a useful summary of
                    fundamental constitutional principles.</p>
                <p>Powell's <hi rend="i">A Community Built on Words</hi> is a masterful work of constitutional history
                    and theory with profound current relevance. Serious students of constitutional law should consider
                    it essential reading. Anyone with a basic understanding of the subject will come away enriched by
                    the gems of information and wisdom that densely pack this slim volume. All participants in our
                    constitutional democracy, from judges to citizens, should heed Powell's lessons and protect,
                    embrace, and cherish our legacy of reliance on constitutional principles to order political
                    controversy and build community.</p>

                    </placeName> Symphony Orchestra. Thomas Akins, long-time principal timpanist for the orchestra, is
                    now its archivist and the author of this interesting history. Generously illustrated and
                    well-produced, the volume structures the orchestra's history by conductor, beginning with Ferdinand
                    Schaefer, who personally selected a group of area musicians and sent them invitations to join the
                    new orchestra. The history concludes with the current maestro, Swiss-born Mario Venzago, before
                    moving topically through the orchestra's educational programs, its volunteers, biographies of
                    current musicians, a history of the orchestra's current home (the Circle Theater), and a complete
                    roster of all the musicians and staff from the seventy-five-year history. The book concludes with a
                    comprehensive discography. Anyone who has enjoyed ISO concerts over the years will love this volume;
                    historians will learn a great deal about the orchestra's cultural and economic contributions to <placeName>
