            <p>The name was originally Scrivener, a professional writer or conveyancer. The first of the name in
                    America was Matthew Scrivener–a member of the Council of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> colony in 1607. It does not appear that he had a family, but he was commended by Capt.
                    John Smith, as a very wise, understanding gentleman. He was drowned in the <geogName>James
                    river</geogName> a year or two after his arrival.</p>
            <p>Benjamin Scrivener of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Norwalk</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
               </placeName>, is reported to be the ancestor of the Scribners
                    in this country. From little that is known of him, and his family we learn that he married Hannah
                    Crampton March 5, 1680, and that he had four sons of whom Matthew the youngest is the ancestor of
                    the line to be considered. Benjamin adhered to the name of Scrivener, for, in a deed of land to his
                    son Matthew, bearing date of September 20, 1741, when he must have been over 80 years of age, he
                    signs it Scrivener. The town clerk, when recording the names of his grandchildren born after 1742,
                    wrote Scribner, doubtless by direction of their parents. Nathaniel Scribner, eldest son of Matthew,
                    married Phebe Kellogg and had a family of thirteen children, among them Joel, Nathaniel, and Abner
                    the three brothers who settled <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Not long after his marriage Nathaniel, Sr., purchased a farm in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Putnam county</region>, <region type="state" reg="nyu">New
                    York</region>
               </placeName>. At that time there were few inhabitants, all farmers, living at long
                    distances from each other, and having none of the conveniences or privileges of older communities.
                    Mr. Scribner built <pb n="212" id="VAA4025-017-3-002"/> a large house, not far from the church at
                    which the Rev. Elias Kent officiated so long that the country there about came to be known as Kents
                    Parish.</p>
            <p>The Scribners were known to be very hospitable, and their home became the gathering place for the
                    widely scattered members of the congregation, who came to church–not in carriage or even
                    wagons, but on foot or on horseback. In the interval between the services many of them were
                    accustomed to assemble in Mr. Scribner's comfortable rooms, and spend an hour in pleasant
                    converse while partaking of the lunch they had brought with them or more frequently,-that provided
                    by their host. In this way, Mr. and Mrs. Scribner became widely known and respected as a Christian
                    family.</p>
            <p>When the war for independence commenced, he was one of the first to identify himself with the patriot
                    cause. He was commissioned a lieutenant but was later promoted to a captaincy. Having early in the
                    struggle received a wound in battle which disabled one of his arms, he was stationed with his
                    company on the borders of the "Neutral Ground", not far from his home, and thus
                    lost the opportunity for further advancement. It is related that on one occasion he had leave of
                    absence, for forty-eight hours. His wife found his stockings in a very bad condition. She
                    immediately sent one of her boys to clip the wool off a sheep, carded and spun the wool into yarn
                    and knit a pair of stockings for the captain before the time was up. (She surely was some knitter.)</p>
            <p>At the close of the war, society was disorganized, and industry paralyzed: more perhaps, in that
                    section of the state than in any other, so that Captain Scribner found it necessary, in his crippled
                    condition to resort to some other means than farming to gain a livelihood for his large family.
                    Happily he was provided with a brain to devise and a will to carry out his plans.</p>
            <p>He returned to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> and built a tide-water flouring mill at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Norwalk</settlement>
                    </placeName> which he sold. He then built a larger one and a residence at Campo, on the Sound. It
                    was so successful that he, and some of his relatives were encouraged to build a large mill at
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Millford</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
               </placeName>, which, on account of a mistake of the millwright, proved
                    a failure, and his financial ruin. As soon as his affairs were settled, Captain <pb n="213" id="VAA4025-017-3-003"/> Scribner began business anew, finding new fields for his activities.
                    His plans required a journey to <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, and while traveling in that state, he was stricken with fever (probably yellow fever.)
                    Unable to find proper accommodations, nursing, or medical care, he soon yielded to the malady, and
                    died in 1790 among strangers, far from home with no friend to perform the offices of affection at
                    his bedside while living or, after death, tenderly and reverently to commit his body to the grave.
                    The letter announcing his death was carefully preserved by his widow and kept on her person till her
                    death.</p>
            <p>Four of Captain Scribner's sons were engaged in mercantile pursuits in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York city</settlement>
                    </placeName>, one of them Elijah died in early manhood, leaving his property to his mother, who,
                    with two of her daughters, established a boarding school for young ladies at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Elizabethtown</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="nju">New
                    Jersey</region>
               </placeName>. The three sons who founded the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> were Joel, Abner and Nathaniel. In the year 1811 Joel Scribner, with his family
                    consisting of a wife and seven children, his brother-in-law William Waring, with his wife and three
                    small sons, and Harry, the brother of William decided to "go west". Accordingly
                    they left <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> to establish a business which was to be carried on by the three partners. The Waring
                    brothers understood the business, which was that of making leather, while Mr. Scribner was to attend
                    to the financial part of it. The journey from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a great undertaking in those days. Each family was furnished with a large wagon,
                    drawn by three horses, and filled with household goods, provisions, and children. On the 17th of
                    October the two families left <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Elizabethtown</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
               </placeName> and began their long, tedious journey
                    to the far west, as it was then called, and as it indeed was, at that time of slow traveling. They
                    journeyed directly across the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>, passing through "Scotch Plains", <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plainfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Somerville, and many other towns, crossing the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> at Carton, and traveling through the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as that was considered the best route. A great many towns and cities have been built
                    since that time, so only a few of them are mentioned. Leaving Easton they passed through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bethlehem</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Allentown, crossing the <pb n="214" id="VAA4025-017-3-004"/>
                    <geogName>Schuylkill river</geogName> at Reading, and the Susquehanna at Harris-burgh, then
                    journeying through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Carlisle</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Shippensburgh, Chambersburgh, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>,
                            <settlement type="city">Somerset</settlement>
               </placeName>, <geogName>Laurel Hill</geogName>,
                    and Greens-burgh, and at last reaching <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Many incidents occurred on the journey, a few of which will be mentioned. At one town, court was in
                    session, and it was impossible to get accommodation at the only inn, which was crowded, so they had
                    to go on to the next village where, as it was late in the evening, there was a long wait before
                    their supper was served. At another place there was no water to be had for the horses, and one of
                    the travelers had to take one of their horses, hitch it to a sled, and go two miles for water.
                    Another mishap was the loss of one of their horses, which ate too much green corn, as there was
                    nothing else to give them; consequently they had great difficulty in procuring another, but finally
                    found an old Revolutionary steed, which they purchased for $15. The roads nearly all the
                    way were exceedingly muddy, so their progress was necessarily slow, and what made matters worse, men
                    were ploughing up the roads in places to make turnpikes, so in many places they were all but
                    impassable. They met many large road wagons with wheels nearly a foot broad, hauled by five or six
                    horses carrying goods across the Alleghanies to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, there being no other method of transportation at that time. They reached the top of
                    the mountains about sunset, expecting, no doubt, to see a fine view, but as it was raining old Sol
                    was in hiding, and the prospect far from pleasing. They stopped at a large stone tavern but as there
                    were many travelers and teamsters ahead of them they had to wait till nine o'clock for
                    their suppers but then were served with fried chicken, hot coffee and other good things, which were
                    greatly appreciated.</p>
            <p>They reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> about the first of November, all rejoiced that they were done traveling through the
                    mud, for they intended to make the remainder of the journey by water. Accordingly they sold their
                    wagons, sent the horses through by land, purchased a flatboat and provisions, and after fixing up
                    the cabin, as comfortably as possible for the women and children, loaded on their goods and embarked
                    on the untried waters of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <pb n="215" id="VAA4025-017-3-005"/>
            <p>They went slowly, tying up at night as the river was very low. There was a difference of opinion
                    between the Waring brothers and Mr. Scribner, in regard to keeping the Sabbath. The former thought
                    it was better to keep on, saving time, while Mr. Scribner, who was a
                    "blue-stocking" Presbyterian, contended that it was breaking the fourth
                    commandment, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy" to travel on that day, had
                    his way and they tied up on Sundays. They landed at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, November 30, just three weeks after leaving <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They found it extremely difficult to procure a house, so many from the east were
                    arriving daily, consequently they had to remain on the boat for five weeks before they were finally
                    settled in a small house, on a back street.</p>
            <p>Many other families in boats along the shore endured the same discomforts. In February 1812, the
                    whole western country was visited by earthquakes and shocks some of which were very severe, so much
                    so, that the inhabitants of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> were very much alarmed and some so terror stricken that they forsook their homes for
                    the streets. It was at this time that the town of New Madrid, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, was almost destroyed by them.</p>
            <p>It was the purpose of the Warings to establish themselves as soon as possible in their business on a
                    large and extensive scale, and they very soon began to purchase material, even before they had
                    secured a site for their business. It was their intention also to add to their trading, boot and
                    shoe making in all its branches, and in a short time they had a large shoe shop in operation. In
                    order to compete with the best shops of the kind, and for the purpose of obtaining the finest
                    material it was thought best for Mr. Scribner to go to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and purchase such stock as they needed.</p>
            <p>Accordingly he left his family, strangers in a strange land, and as there was nothing better than
                    stage coaching in those days, for the traveling public, he was gone nearly all the remainder of the
                    winter, and had the misfortune of having his pocket picked of $800, so you see there was
                    wickedness abroad in the land, then, as now. It must have been done by a fellow traveler, as the
                    empty pocket book was found on the floor of the coach, with papers scattered around. Every <pb n="216" id="VAA4025-017-3-006"/> effort was made to find the thief but they decided he must have
                    left the coach before the theft was discovered.</p>
            <p>According to the custom of the times, all men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five must
                    "train" or "muster" as it was called either among the militia of
                    the state, or some independent company. One of the Warings joined a cavalry company, and was made an
                    officer and the other joined the light infantry, and soon after war with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> was declared, the War of 1812. Of course the companies to which the brothers belonged
                    had to go. This was the breaking up of the business of the firm of Scribner and Waring; consequently
                    all had to be sold to the best advantage, and during the summer and fall it was accomplished. During
                    the year all the troops from <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName> and Indiana passed through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> on their way north, which to the children, especially, was a most interesting sight. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a small town when they arrived, was rapidly growing with emigrants from the north and
                    east. At that time there were no public improvements of any kind, except a small market-house on the
                    "bottom" east of Main street, and no wharf or other improvements on the river
                    front. There was an old stone building on the hill, west of Main street near, and a little north, of
                    Dr. Williams' old frame church, which had a large grave-yard in the rear.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 1812 Mr. Scribner's two younger brothers arrived at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and in December or January the three brothers started off on an exploring expedition,
                    with the view of purchasing wild land and laying out a new town. When they visited the site of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with the falls of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> so near, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, almost opposite, quite a flourishing town they enquired to whom it belonged, and
                    ascertaining that the land belonged to Col. John Paul of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, after some delay purchased eight hundred and sixty acres for eight thousand
                    dollars, being nearly ten dollars per acre, a high price for wild land, at that time. They also had
                    the sole right of ferriage across the river. They returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and made arrangements for removal, and on the 2nd day of March, 1813, the first tree
                    was cut down to make a clearing in the wilderness for the erection of a large log cabin. This spot
                    was at the corner of <pb n="217" id="VAA4025-017-3-007"/> what is now, east Sixth and Main streets,
                    and just two months afterwards the two families landed from the flatboat which had brought them down
                    the river, and moved into the large mansion which had been built for them. As Mr. Waring had gone to
                    the help of his country in its time of need, Mr. Scribner had to take charge of his little family.
                    The Warings were never heard from and it was not known, by the family, whether they were killed, but
                    it was supposed they were. Mrs. Waring afterward married again and there was no "Enoch
                    Arden" episode.</p>
            <p>The large double cabin of the first settlers must have been well filled with Joel Scribner, his wife
                    and seven children and across the hall Mrs. Waring and three children and the other brothers
                    Nathaniel and Abner. Of course, the cabin was built of green logs, entirely unseasoned and was
                    finished as well as possible during the summer. The whole site of the proposed town was covered with
                    a virgin forest of beech, maple, poplar and oak, with a heavy undergrowth of pawpaw, sassafras,
                    spice-wood, green brier, and almost every other kind of shrub incident to a rich soil, so that when
                    the leaves had obtained their full growth in summer it was impossible to see a rod ahead in the
                    woods. The view from Kane knob west of the place, where a good view of the surrounding country could
                    be obtained, was wonderfully beautiful. Bayard Taylor who visited our city in the 50's said
                    he had seen many beautiful views in many lands but none were finer than those from our knobs, now
                    called "<geogName>Silver Hills</geogName>". Men were procured (probably from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>) to cut down trees, grub out stumps and prepare for the surveyor, and the platting of
                    the town. The man who had the honor of surveying the ground was John K. Graham, and the chain he
                    used is still preserved by some of his descendants. William Scribner second son of Joel, thirteen
                    years of age at the time, was in after years, proud to tell that he assisted in the work by carrying
                    the chain.</p>
            <p>Very soon a saw mill was built and in one year afterwards the first frame house was completed by Joel
                    S. Scribner and the family moved into it. It is a two story and a half house, with a narrow entrance
                    hall, and stairs also rather narrow and steep, with two rooms opening from it one at the side <pb n="218" id="VAA4025-017-3-008"/> and one at the rear, and back of the room is a porch the width
                    of the house, with another one over it opening from the back room of the second story. On the second
                    floor are three rooms and a hall, with stairs leading to a large attic chamber, which is not
                    divided, but is as large as two rooms. The house has also a large basement dining room with a small
                    kitchen at one end, and a door leading into a cellar at the other. This house, which is in pretty
                    good repair, considering its age, has been purchased by Piankashaw chapter D. A. R., for a chapter
                    house, hoping to preserve it for an∗ other century. It has been occupied by some of the
                    Scribner family until 1917 when Miss Harriett Scribner, daughter of Dr. William Scribner and
                    grand-daughter of Joel, was called to her reward, at the age of eighty-two years. Miss Scribner was
                    a fine musician, and taught music for more than sixty years in the front room of the house which was
                    called the "music room". She taught piano, cabinet organ, guitar, banjo, and any
                    other stringed instrument that was brought to her. She also taught vocal. She was organist and
                    leader of the choir of the First Presbyterian church for many years and, before her time, and the
                    time when instruments were used in churches, her father Dr. Scribner led the singing, raising the
                    tunes with a tuning fork. Most of the family were and are musical.</p>
            <p>The first public sale of lots in the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> took place on the second and third days of November, 1813, by which time there were
                    several log cabins along Main street, and in the course of the summer quite a number of families had
                    moved in. Among the first buildings erected, was a large square cabin for a schoolhouse. The
                    brothers donated the four corners of State and Spring streets for city purposes–one for a
                    courthouse, one for a schoolhouse, the third for a city hall, and the remaining one for a jail.</p>
            <p>The site for the schoolhouse, was afterward moved one square west, as, I presume, it was thought to
                    be too near the jail. In later years it was used for a high school, and is still called the
                    "The Scribner High School." Some years ago, it was taken for a colored high, and
                    as it was getting aged the city proposed to build a schoolhouse in a part of the town where most of
                    the colored population lived, but found that if <pb n="219" id="VAA4025-017-3-009"/> they moved the
                    site the ground would revert to the Scribner heirs, so they built a new house on the old corner and
                    it is still called the "Scribner High School." The first Scribner to be born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> was Harriett, daughter of Joel and Mary, in 1815. Nathaniel Scribner made a trip (or
                    rather a journey) to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, by stage coach in the month of June, 1815, and when he returned was accompanied by a
                    cousin Miss Elizabeth Edmonds whom he met while east for the first time and a year later she became
                    his wife. The same year another brother James, and the mother, Mrs. Phebe Scribner, with her
                    daughter Esther came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Scribner and two daughters had been teaching a private school for young ladies at
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Elizabethtown</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
               </placeName>, and when one of them died, the mother and
                    daughter who was left, decided to come west to be with her sons. She built the central part of a
                    large frame house on the corner of Main and west First streets, which afterwards was added to and
                    became a tavern, conducted by Dr. Nathan Hale who married Mrs. Scribner's daughter Esther.
                    It is only a few months since that old building which was used for a tavern or hotel, until a few
                    years ago, was torn down. It flourished under the name of the High Street house (Main street was
                    formerly called High) and Commercial Hotel for many years.</p>
            <p>At this time the capital of Indiana territory was at Cory-don and as it was ascertained that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> was partly in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark</region>
                    </placeName> and partly in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison counties</region>
                    </placeName> during a session of the legislature at Corydon in 1818, Nathaniel Scribner and Mr.
                    Graham went to that place to petition for a new county, so a slice of each county was taken to form
                    the county of Floyd named for Gen. Davis Floyd who was one of the early settlers. Mr. Scribner was
                    ill while at Corydon and on the way home became suddenly worse and they stopped at the home of
                    Richard Watson, a few miles from the town. A doctor and his brothers were sent for, but he died
                    before they reached the place. So died the youngest of the three brothers in his early manhood when
                    the town was still in its infancy leaving a young wife to mourn his loss.</p>
            <p>It was a remarkable fact that the three Scribner brothers, after their wonderful undertaking of
                    founding a new town, <pb n="220" id="VAA4025-017-3-010"/> lived such a short time to enjoy it. Joel
                    only lived ten years after arriving, and died at the age of 51 years. Abner left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and died a few years later. Joel's wife, Mary Scribner, died of cholera in
                    1832.</p>
            <p>In beautiful Fairview cemetery are the graves of Joel, his wife, his mother, his sons Harvey, William
                    Eliphlet, and his daughters Harriett, Phebe and Mary. Mary was the first wife of Dr. Ashael Clapp,
                    Phebe the wife of James Cooper Davis. Harriett died in infancy. A great grandaughter of Joel
                    Scribner lives in <placeName>

            <p>The town was incorporated in 1817 by the Scribner brothers, John Edmonson, and Charles Woodruff. On

                        <region type="county">Floyd county</region>
                    </placeName>, Davis Floyd was made judge and Isaac Van Buskirk, associate; Joel Scribner, clerk and
                    recorder; James Besse, sheriff, and Isaac Stewart, assessor. Court opened May 19, 1819. Charles
                    Paxson, Clement Vance, Jr., and Jacob Pierroll were the first commissioners. They met first at the
                    house of Seth Woodruff and continued to make that their official place for several years. On
                    February 10, 1819, the commissioners "ordered that tavern keepers within the county of
                    Floyd observe in their taverns the following rates: For breakfast, 31¼ cents; dinner,
                    34½ cents; supper, 25 cents; lodging, per night, 12½ cents; peach or apple
                    brandy and gin, 18¾ cents per pint; <placeName>
                        <country reg="jm">Jamaica</country>
                    </placeName> spirits, per half pint, 84½ cents; corn or oats, per gallon 12½
                    cents. (I hope this will not make any of my readers thirsty.) On May 3, 1819, Seth Woodruff was paid
                    $50 for building a jail and the total expenses for the first year of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Floyd county</region>
                    </placeName> government was $208.97. The state and county tax for 1820 <pb n="221" id="VAA4025-017-3-011"/> was $1,210.40½. On May 24th of that year Abraham
                    Littell was fined $6.00 for refusing to accept the office of overseer of the poor.
                    February 10, 1820, it was ordered that the treasurer pay William Norwood $10 for drawing
                    a plan for a courthouse. It was also ordered that the building of the courthouse and gaol be sold to
                    the lowest bidder on the third Monday of March. Ordered that the above action be published in the
                        <hi rend="i">Indianian</hi> of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> of Corydon, and one notice be posted on Seth
                    Woodruff's door. On the 20th of April (a postponed date) the job was bid off by Charles
                    Paxson and others for $7,860. The contractors soon discovered, however, that they had
                    taken the work too low and abandoned it. Subsequently the people complained regarding the
                    inconveniences. The commissioners brought suit against the bondsmen for the $6,000 they
                    had pledged themselves to raise, and as steps were being taken to remove the county seat, the people
                    opened a subscription to build a courthouse. The total raised was $3,256.00, which was
                    thought to be enough for a good-sized house.</p>
            <p>This building was occupied in November, 1824, but Seth Woodruff, who subscribed $100 for a
                    cupola and bell, failed to complete his part of the agreement until 1827 when<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    the upper rooms having been completed at a cost of $100 additional, the cupola and bell
                    were added. The cost of the structure, which was used for more than forty years as a seat of county
                    justice, was less than $3,000.</p>
            <p>Just here I must give a sketch of Seth Woodruff. He came here from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName> about 1818 and erected a large frame tavern. He is described as a large-framed,
                    large-brained man, kind-hearted and genial. He came west with a family and with plenty of energy,
                    physical strength and go-a-headativeness, which made his presence felt in the community. He was a
                    man of force, a Baptist preacher, a tavern keeper, a bricklayer, and in fact, almost anything
                    required in a new country. He served for years as a justice of the peace his picket-fence signature
                    being a striking characteristic in the old county records. His tavern was headquarters for all kinds
                    of business, till the erection of the courthouse in 1824.</p>
            <pb n="222" id="VAA4025-017-3-012"/>
            <p>An anecodote is related of him showing the diversity of his talents. A young physician, Dr. John
                    Sloan, had recently arrived in the city, (1828) and was walking around getting acquainted with the
                    place. At a place where a brick building was in process of erection, he noticed a fine looking man
                    laying brick, and inquired of a bystander who he was. The reply was Seth Woodruff. An hour or two
                    afterwards he passed a place where court was being held and thinking the judge had a familiar look
                    inquired his name. Seth Woodruff, was the reply. In the afternoon he happened to pass the Baptist
                    church, when a funeral was going on (being a doctor he was interested in funerals), so went in and
                    was much surprised to see Judge Woodruff as the officiating clergyman.</p>
            <p>In 1821, four years after the town was incorporated, an incident occurred which demonstrated the
                    early strength of the feeling, which forty years afterward led to the Civil war. One day a party of
                    men came over from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, and in broad daylight, took possession of a well known colored free man whom they
                    claimed was a runaway slave. They succeeded in getting him to the river, and were about to put him
                    in their skiff, when Judge Woodruff and several other prominent men who happened to be across the
                    river saw the commotion and hastened home. The moment they landed, Judge Woodruff, who knew the man,
                    demanded the release. The Kentuckians at first refused, but as a large and threatening crowd from
                    the town had gathered, they were compelled to let their prey go. They did not permit the matter to
                    rest there, however, but stood on their right of a trial to determine whether the man was a slave or
                    not. A day was set, and the kidnappers came over with their number increased by a crowd of stalwart
                    men, well armed. To prevent violence on their part, a company of militia, which had been formed in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was summoned to be at the trial. The man was early proved to be a free man. The
                    Kentuckians, enraged at being worsted at law, began a commotion during which one of their number
                    attacked Judge Woodruff. A <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> boy whom the judge had befriended then pounced on the man and brought upon himself the
                    fury of the mob. His life was for a moment in imminent peril, but he was rescued by the prompt
                    action of the militia.</p>
            <pb n="223" id="VAA4025-017-3-013"/>
            <p>By 1816 the town had slowly emerged from the forest, and numbered about two hundred. Its foundations
                    had been laid largely in faith and prayer, Joel Scribner being a devotedly pious man, and had
                    exercised, from the beginning an influence for truth and righteousness. When the original plat was
                    made by the Scribner brothers, several valuable lots were reserved for the support of a Presbyterian
                    church, and with unusual generosity, for those days, they donated to the Methodist church the site
                    on which they erected their first church building. The growing desire for an organization of the few
                    Christians of the Presbyterian faith living in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> led to a gathering at the latter place, and the organizing on the 16th day of February,
                    1816. The minister who officiated on the occasion was Rev. James Grady, an Irishman from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, who after laboring in the Carolinas and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> had been commissioned by the General Assembly to do mission work and found churches in
                    the territory of Indiana. The Lord's Supper was administered, and the following members
                    enrolled: Gov. Thomas Posey and wife, John Gibson and wife, James M. Tunstall, James Scribner, Joel
                    Scribner, Phebe Scribner (mother of Joel), Esther (his sister, afterwards Mrs. Nathan Hale), Anna M.
                    Gibson. The church was destitute of any stated means of grace during the subsequent months of the
                    year 1816, and of its history little is definitely known, further than that the Rev. D. C. Banks,
                    pastor of a church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and possibly others, occasionally ministered to it. Within a short time of the
                    organization, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> members all withdrew. Thomas Posey and wife moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>; John Gibson and wife, to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>; the other <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> members united with a church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Only the four Scribners who resided in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> were left.</p>
            <p>The church having thus lost the character of a union church, it was proper that it should be
                    reorganized and renamed. The members therefore assembled on the 7th day of December, 1817, in the
                    back parlor of Mrs. Phebe Scribner's house, on the corner of Main and High streets. The
                    moderator of the meeting was the Rev. D. C. Banks, by whom many of the earlier churches of Indiana
                    were organized. It was <pb n="224" id="VAA4025-017-3-014"/> then resolved that as all the members of
                    this church residing in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> have withdrawn, the union church should from this time be known as the First
                    Presbyterian church of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At the same time Jacob Marcell and Hannah, his wife, Stephen Beers and Lydia, his
                    wife, and Mary Scribner, wife of Joel, were received by letter from other churches. The church
                    proceeded to elect two additional elders and Jacob Marcell and Stephen Beers were unanimously
                    elected and subsequently ordained and installed as ruling elders. These, together with Joel
                    Scribner, constituted the session. The Lord's Supper was administered as is usual on
                    organization, and as there was no communion service two large peuter plates belonging to Mrs.
                    Scribner were used and being of very fine quality, were considered very appropriate.</p>
            <p>In 1818 a small church building was erected, a very plain frame structure about 40 by 30 feet, with
                    unplastered walls,-and rough board floor, seats and pulpit.</p>
            <p>It was occupied for only a few months, when it was destroyed by fire. After this, the members
                    worshiped, for a time, with the Methodist brethren, or at the home of Joel Scribner. The
                    congregation becoming too large for Mr. Scribner's house, they used the old courthouse, a
                    rough unfinished building. In this year (1818) also a sabbath school was organized in connection
                    with the church, which is believed to have been the first Sunday school in the state. The
                    distinguished honor of inaugurating this enterprise belongs to Mrs. Nathaniel Scribner and Miss
                    Caroline Silliman. A church building of brick was finished with steeple and bell in 1830, and was
                    considered a fine edifice for that time. It stood on a lot donated by the Scribners. At this time
                    there was a membership of one hundred and thirty-one.</p>
            <p>In 1832 Rev. S. K. Snead was called to become the pastor, and during his ministry one hundred and
                    thirty-nine were added to the membership. In 1835 Mr. Snead began preaching at a private house in
                    the neighborhood of Mount Tabor, usually on alternate sabbaths and formed a Bible class of young
                    persons who met the sabbath afterwards and was productive of much good. In the summer of 1836 a few
                    of the <pb n="225" id="VAA4025-017-3-015"/> members purchased three acres of ground and another acre
                    was given by a man who owned the adjoining farm. This plot was set apart as a campmeeting ground and
                    solemnly named "Mount Tabor" in commemoration of the mount on which our Lord was
                    transfigured. Campmeeting was held here annually and sometimes twice a year until 1833, and many
                    persons were converted and united with the city church. When the Presbyterian church was divided,
                    the campmeetings were continued under the auspices of the Second church and a church building was
                    erected in 1848. Owing to some differences of opinion in regard to Old School and New School (which
                    now happily has been done away with) the Presbyterian church was divided in 1837.</p>
            <p>Presbytery granted permission for the organization of the Second Presbyterian church to which one
                    hundred and three members united. A committee was appointed to make an equitable division of church
                    property. At the division the First church was left with seventy-one members. In December, 1837, the
                    Rev. Wm. C. ‘Anderson was; elected pastor at a salary of $800 and entered on
                    his work the February following and the membership speedily grew to one hundred and three. Although
                    the second year was one of financial embarrassment the contributions of the church amounted to
                    $2,865, including $1,500 for the support of the pastor. A new church edifice
                    began to be spoken of early in 1850, and preliminary steps were taken for its erection. The old
                    church on State street was torn down and the congregation worshiped in the second story of a store
                    room of one of the members until the fall of 1852, when they began holding services in the lecture
                    room or chapel of the new church which had been constructed (partly) of the brick from the old
                    church. The present building was completed, with the exception of the spire, in 1854 and dedicated
                    in the spring of that year. The spire and bell were added some years later. The style of the church
                    is <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Norman</settlement>
                    </placeName> of the twelfth century, and the finish chaste and elegant, being one of the most
                    churchly interiors in the state. The total cost was about $35,000, and it is worthy of
                    record that the money was raised as the work proceeded, without asking or receiving a dollar beyond
                    the bounds of the congregation, and with very <pb n="226" id="VAA4025-017-3-016"/> little debt when
                    completed. At this time (1854) the town had grown to 17,000 inhabitants with 14 Evangelical churches
                    with a membership of 2,300 and church sittings for 5,800. Of the 4,000 children between the ages of
                    five and twenty-one years about 1,700 were in the sabbath schools.</p>
            <p>In 1898 the First Presbyterian church was gutted by a spectacular but disastrous fire, during which
                    the beautiful spire was wrapped in flames and fell to the street. Only the bare wall remained. The
                    fine organ, the communion service, the music, all were gone. There was much discussion in regard to
                    rebuilding. Many wanted the church built in the eastern part of the city, but as it was found that
                    most of the walls were safe, it was decided to rebuild on the old site. After heroic efforts, owing
                    to insufficient insurance to replace the loss, the building was restored as nearly like the original
                    as possible and is now regarded as the best auditorium in the city. The congregation, within the
                    past year, has rebuilt the chapel, adding many rooms for the accommodation of the increasing sabbath
                    school and for the use of women's organizations of the church. The pastor in charge (1921)
                    is Rev. Walter T. Pearcy, a native of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, who is doing a good work and is greatly beloved by his people.</p>
            <p>The first building of the Second Presbyterian church was on the corner of Main and East Third streets
                    and was occupied by them until about eighteen years ago when a large modern church with manse on
                    adjoining lot was built. Some years after the Second church was organized due to the rapid growth
                    and to many of the members living in the eastern portion of the city, it was thought best to divide
                    and the Third Presbyterian church was organized. A lot was donated by the heirs of Judge Conner, and
                    a building erected as a mission chapel on East Ninth street prior to the division. The church
                    prospered, and February 9, 1868, a substantial stone building was erected on the corner of Spring
                    and East Ninth streets costing $26,000. Rev. Charles served the church as pastor for
                    fifty years and, by his zealous and consistent character, endeared himself to all good citizens. A
                    church building was erected at Mount Tabor in 1838 and a sabbath school and preaching services are
                    still held there. About three years ago the Second and Third united in one <pb n="227" id="VAA4025-017-3-017"/> church, and the Third church property was sold to the First Baptist
                    church and the Second church adopted the name of Hutchinson church in honor of the beloved pastor of
                    the Third. The present pastor is Rev. Thomas B. Geshman, DD. L.L.D.</p>
            <p>Rev. John Shrader organized a class of the Methodist Episcopal church at the residence of Mrs. Ruff
                    in 1817, and in November of that year dedicated the first church building in the town, on a lot
                    donated by the Scribner brothers. In 1830 a brick building was erected. This was sold in 1854,
                    having been used for twenty-four years, and a building solidly constructed of hard brick, 520,000
                    being used in its erection. With the parsonage the property is valued at $30,000.</p>
            <p>As Centenery Methodist church was organized in 1839, just one hundred years from the beginning of
                    Methodism in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in the old foundry, it was given its name. The church building is on Spring street
                    above East Third and the parsonage is on the lot below. The building has been somewhat remodeled but
                    stands essentially as it was erected nearly three-quarters of a century ago. It has always been well
                    attended, and is popular with the general public. The present pastor is the Rev. J. A. Sumnold.</p>
            <p>On the corner of Spring and east Thirteenth was built Trinity Methodist church in 1889 at a cost of
                    $40,000. It has a membership of about 400, and is an active and progressive church. A
                    fine brick parsonage also belongs to this church. The present incumbent is Rev. W. H. Hargett.</p>
            <p>Main Street Methodist church was organized about 1850 and named Roberts Chapel in honor of Bishop
                    Roberts, but was changed some years ago. The present brick edifice was erected in 1877 and quite
                    recently a parsonage has been added on the lot adjoining. The membership is between three and four
                    hundred. The present pastor, Rev. W. H. Hamerton, has done a great work here and is so beloved by
                    his people that they have insisted on his return year after year and their desire has been granted.</p>
            <p>Calvary church, a class of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> Methodists, was formed about 1850, meeting for several years in one of the public
                    school buildings. The brick church on Spring and east Fifth <pb n="228" id="VAA4025-017-3-018"/>
                    streets was dedicated in 1889 or 1890. The parsonage is back of the church on Fifth street. They
                    have several hundred members. The name of the church was changed during the war from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> Methodist Episcopal church to Calvary.</p>
            <p>In 1865 the late Hon. W. C. Depauw purchased a building formerly used by the Episcopal church and had
                    it moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> street where it was long known as Kingsley Mission and Mr. Depauw was superintendent of
                    the Sunday school. This was burned in 1883 and Mr. Depauw replaced it with another building. Just as
                    it was ready for dedication, Jennie Depauw, aged 13, died, and in memory of the daughter of one who
                    has contributed more to Methodist enterprises than any other man in this section it was named Jennie
                    De Pauw Memorial November 3, 1884. It has grown very rapidly and now has a large membership and the
                    largest men's Bible class in southern Indiana, called "The Love-Wise
                    Class." This church although it has been twice burned down and re-built, is one of the
                    strongest Methodist churches in the city.</p>
            <p>Seth Woodruff, who has been mentioned elsewhere in this narrative organized the First Baptist church
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, about 1825. After ten years dissensions arose which led to a division, 43 members
                    going to form the Park Christian church and in 1844 a Second Baptist church was formed. The old
                    First Baptist continued until 1878, when its principal members united with the present organization.
                    The church on Fourth street near Market was erected in 1879, and was used until this year when it
                    was sold and the Third Presbyterian church purchased. It has quite a large membership and is now in
                    a prosperous condition under the pastorate of Rev. Mr. Woods.</p>
            <p>Park Christian church was founded May 19, 1835, by forty-three members who had withdrawn from the
                    Baptist church. The present commodious edifice was erected in 1869 on the corner of Market street
                    and Scribner park, and is a handsome building and the church has an increasing membership.</p>
            <p>Central Christian society was organized in January, 1872, with thirty members and a church building
                    on Spring near east Fifth was erected the following summer. This church <pb n="229" id="VAA4025-017-3-019"/> now has one of the finest buildings in the city, modern in every
                    respect, and has recently built a fine parsonage. The membership is between four and five hundred
                    and the pastor, Rev. H. G. Connelly, one of the most popular in the city.</p>
            <p>Culbertson Avenue Baptist is a small church in the eastern part of the city, erected in 1889.</p>
            <p>The advent Christian church is in a frame building in the eastern end of the city. It was built in
                    1819 and has a membership of about 250.</p>
            <p>In the year 1834, the few faithful Episcopal churchmen who had cast in their lot in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> felt called upon to break the ground and plant the vine. Lathrop Elderkin, to whom with
                    Elizabeth Burnett is due the credit for the enterprise, called a meeting, at the former's
                    residence, of the citizens who were friendly to the establishment of a church in this community.
                    This meeting was held on the evening of July 19, 1834. On the 22d day of February, 1839, a lot was
                    purchased for a building and the committee was ordered to proceed with the erection of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Paul</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Episcopal church. On the 10th of April, 1839, the bishop laid the corner
                    stone. In this building the services of the church were conducted until the 24th of November, 1863,
                    when the property was sold to the Lutherans. On February 10, 1864, a lot, 60 by 120 feet, was
                    purchased on east Main street near Sixth for $1,300 cash, and the work of building a
                    frame church was at once commenced. On June 1, 1865, the corner stone was laid. For nearly thirty
                    years this was the home of the church. On June 22, 1890, the present church lot was purchased, and
                    the work of raising funds to build a stone church commenced. On September 19, 1892, the lot on Main
                    street was sold, and services were held in one of the frame buildings that was on the property of
                    the new site. On the 13th day of July, 1904, the debt was paid, the mortgage burned, and the church
                    was ready for consecration. The impressive ceremonies of consecration were held on the 27th day of
                    April, 1905, the Right Reverend Joseph Marshall Francis, bishop of the diocese officiating. Although
                    seventy-five years have rolled around since this parish was established, it is but a brief span in
                    the life of a church. What will be recorded in the next quarter of a century? <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Paul</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s has had an historic record of which <pb n="230" id="VAA4025-017-3-020"/> its
                    members may well be proud. It has sent out ministers to many parts of the country who have
                    accomplished much. One remarkable thing connected with the church is, that one of its members,
                    Admiral George A. Bicknell (retired), has the distinction of being the son and grandson of two
                    previous senior wardens, all bearing the same name. The present rector is Rev. F. J. Mallett. The
                    women of the parish are active and enterprising and have several societies, among them the Auxiliary
                    Altar guild. The men have the St. Andrews brotherhood.</p>
            <p>Some years ago, there was a small frame church in the western part of the city for the United
                    Brethren denomination. For reasons unknown to the writer this church was given up, and the building
                    used for a mission sabbath school. A few years ago, a new church was built in the eastern end of the
                    city, and is now in a very flourishing condition. Rev. J. M. Dick is the pastor. The Advent
                    Christian church is also in the eastern part of the city and is a frame building, which was erected
                    in 1891. They have a membership of about 200.</p>
            <p>The Evangelical church is one of the strongest churches in the city. It was organized in 1837 with
                    forty-three members, with Rev. Henry Evess as pastor. Meetings were held in the schoolhouse and the
                    old courthouse until 1843, when a church was built on State street near Oak.</p>
            <p>In 1865 the Zion Lutheran congregation consolidated with the Evangelical and in 1870 the present
                    handsome edifice was erected at a cost of over $20,000. Since that time a fine Sunday
                    school building has been built next to the church, and a parsonage has been added on the corner
                    above east Third and Spring. The interior of the church was burned June, 1882, but was immediately
                    rebuilt and a new organ installed. The present pastor, F. A. Mensch, has been here for a number of
                    years.</p>
            <p>We have two large Roman Catholic churches, St. Marys' and Holy Trinity. Both are large, with
                    fine buildings, good schools and many adherents.</p>
            <p>We have four churches for colored people, two Baptist and two Methodist. The First Baptist, colored,
                    purchased <pb n="231" id="VAA4025-017-3-021"/> the old Second Presbyterian church and is the largest
                    of the colored churches.</p>

            <p>The educational advantages of a city have much to do with its desirability as a residence and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> stands in the front rank in this particular. The founders of the town were zealous
                    promoters of education and a permanent endowment fund of five thousand dollars was set apart, the
                    interest of which was to go perpetually for school improvement. In the first year of development a
                    large log schoolhouse was erected on the corner of State and Spring streets. This was also used as a
                    place for religious worship for two or three years. Stephen Beers was the first school teacher of
                    whom we have record. Mr. Cornelius taught in the upper part of James Anderson's shoe shop
                    about 1820. An act incorporating the schools of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> was passed January 8, 1821, which placed the control in a board of managers and John A.
                    Spaulding continued as the sole teacher for many years.</p>
            <p>In 1838 the school was divided into male and female departments, and additional teachers obtained. As
                    the accumulation of interest on the endowment fund amounted to a considerable sum, it was determined
                    to erect a brick building on the corner of west First and Spring streets and a neat two story brick,
                    known as the Scribner high school was completed in the spring of 1849. In 1853 the city assumed
                    control of the public schools under a board of trustees and a complete system of grading was
                    arranged. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> high school was opened in 1853 with George H. Harrison in charge. The school enrollment
                    of July, 1854, shows 1,570 pupils, with twenty-eight teachers in service, but the law to provide for
                    a uniform system of common schools having that fall been declared unconstitutional, school progress
                    was practically closed for a year or two. Charles Barnes was elected city superintendent and
                    principal of the high school in 1855 and James E. May in 1857. The schools were badly disarranged
                    during the Civil war, several of the buildings being taken for hospitals for wounded soldiers. The
                    schools were without a superintendent for eight years following, during which time <pb n="232" id="VAA4025-017-3-022"/> many private schools flourished. As late as 1870, only twenty-eight per
                    cent of the school enumeration attended the public schools. In that year the female high school was
                    organized and new life infused into educational interests. Each succeeding year has added to the
                    efficiency of our school system, and today all classes of citizens enjoy its privileges.</p>
            <p>In addition to the usual funds received for school work, the annual interest of the investment has
                    been a great aid. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> has kept abreast of the times in the free education of her youth, although the female
                    high school was not organized till 1840. When a high school was first begun in 1855 girls had the
                    upper room and boys the lower and a female teacher had charge of the girls' room, but the
                    recitations were together, the boys coming up to the girls' room for some of them, and the
                    girls going down to the boys' room for others, and we had devotional exercises conducted by
                    the male teacher together in the boys' room, every morning. One of the petitions which
                    Professor Barnes always had in his prayer, has stayed with one pupil for sixty years, it was from
                    James, 3rd chapter and 17th verse. "Give us that wisdom which cometh from above, which is
                    first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without
                    partiality, and without hypocrisy." There are now about fifteen schools for white and four
                    for colored children in the city. We also have an excellent Business college where many of our
                    business men and women have been trained.</p>

            <p>The opinions of the people are largely moulded by the newspapers; and to enterprising journals the
                    progress of a city is often due. The press of <placeName>

                    </placeName> has generally held an honorable reputation and ever been ready to advocate measures
                    designed for the upbuilding of the place. Ebenezer Patrick started the first paper in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>

            <p>In November, 1830, Collins brothers, Henry, Thomas and James, commenced the <hi rend="i">Gazette,</hi> which, with changing proprietors, and under the names of <hi rend="i">Gazette,
                        Bulletin, Commercial</hi> and <hi rend="i">Tribune,</hi> continued in succession until about
                    1870. In 1837 Thomas Collins issued the <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> as a daily. Besides Collins we
                    find the names of Mattingly, William Green, Leonard Green, Theodore Barnett and others connected
                    with the above papers. In 1852 Collins &amp; Green sold out to Milton Gregg, who was later
                    assisted by his sons. J. P. Hancock was the next to revive the papers but with indifferent success.
                    During the greater part of the Civil war no republican paper was printed here, but through the
                    efforts of J. P. Luse, and Schuyler and Harriott the <hi rend="i">Commercial</hi> was started in
                    1864. It was sold to H. N. Gifford who continued it for several years, but finding that it was an
                    unprofitable investment the paper was discontinued. When it was suspended the material and
                    franchises were bought by the <hi rend="i">Ledger</hi> company. For a number of years afterward, the

                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> was noted for its shipyards of which there were six or more. One owner had two
                    steamboats built in one year. At that time it was the principal industry. The shipyards lay along
                    the river front and that portion of the town was thickly populated. Ship carpenters in great numbers
                    found occupation and as mechanics of a superior order they did much to create for <placeName>

                    many of whom had their homes here. The title of captain was then almost as common as that of colonel

                    part, and substantial growth in that direction began. In the lower part of town, ship carpenters
                    built themselves pretty and comfortable homes so that our city was then as now a city of homes.</p>

                    by Captain Irwin and others until recent years. Now that we have two bridges across the

            <p>About the year 1876 some of the charitable women of our city decided that we needed a home for
                    orphans and neglected children. They formed a society for the purpose, and Mr. J. K. Woodward gave
                    them the use of an old building on the corner of Main street and the Scribner park. It had been used
                    as a seminary for young ladies and afterwards for a boarding house, and was in rather a dilapidated
                    condition, but was used for a few years, when Mr. DePauw donated the use of a building at Spring and
                    Third streets, where it remained until 1882. Finding that the inmates were increasing, so that
                    additional room would be needed, Mr. W. C. Culbertson purchased an acre of ground in Elkin avenue
                    and erected a large brick building, which covers about one-third of the lot. He made a free gift of
                    it to the board of managers and it was named Cornelia Memorial in memory of his deceased wife, who
                    had been a much interested member and officer of the board. The building will accommodate sixty
                    inmates. The Home is situated in the upper part of the city in a beautiful, high and healthful
                    place. Every department <pb n="236" id="VAA4025-017-3-026"/> of the house is kept in first class
                    condition, and our citizens greatly appreciate the generosity of Mr. Culbertson, and the successful
                    management of this charitable institution.</p>
            <p>In 1873, Mr. W. S. Culbertson erected a building at a cost of $25,000 which is located on
                    Main and Seventh streets. It is designed for the benefit of needy and worthy old ladies. He made
                    provision for its future maintenance, by a liberal endowment fund. The building will accommodate
                    twenty-five or thirty persons. It is non-sectarian, and the only qualification required is a good
                    moral character, without a home and unable to support themselves.</p>

            <p>The early settlers of the city were well up in literature and art, but its development lay dormant
                    while the "first families" were building log cabins and grubbing out underbrush.
                    Many Yankees settled in the town, principally because slavery was not tolerated. The South, too,
                    contributed on account of the boat-building interests. Only a few of the early writers and painters
                    can be given for want of space. Clement Shields, son of Patrick Shields, conducted a store in the
                    county as early as 1804. In this store he sold books, the best of the period. He also wrote poems.
                    He afterward came to the town and built a large home on Main street. Mrs. Emma Carlton and her
                    sister, Miss Elizabeth Nune-macher, are great grand-daughters of Mr. Patrick Shields and both have
                    literary tastes of a high order. Mrs. Carleton's poems and other writings are sought by
                    many publications. Miss Mary Cardwell is a forceful writer. Mrs. Laura M. Thurston, born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> when quite young. She wrote several volumes of good verse. She died in 1842. George L.
                    Morrison was a poet and portrait painter of note. Several of the old families still have some of his
                    works. Mrs. Mary Scribner Collins has a portrait of her paternal grandmother, Mrs. Margaret Davis,
                    painted by him about seventy-five years ago, which is still a fine portrait. Miss Morrison wrote
                    music as well as poetry. Mrs. Angelina Lorraine Collins, wife of Mr. James Collins, wrote a
                    temperance story called "Mrs. Ben Darby", and she also wrote a <pb n="237" id="VAA4025-017-3-027"/> cook book, both of which were printed by Mr. John R. Nune-macher, and
                    had a large sale.</p>
            <p>Forsythe Wilson wrote "The Old Sergeant", a stirring poem of war times. He was a
                    brother of A. E. Wilson, former governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. August Large, a Catholic priest, wrote two volumes of poetry while a resident of this
                    city, which are preserved in the State library. John R. Nunemacher was the leading publisher of
                    books in southern Indiana in the early days, and he printed numerous volumes for various authors,
                    among them <hi rend="i">The New Purchase</hi> in two volumes by Baynard Rush Hall, a teacher in
                    Indiana seminary. This book is still a classic, recounting Early Indiana history. It was published
                    in one volume in the 50's. A large number of old time authors could be mentioned, but space
                    forbids. In recent years there have been some productions worthy of preservation. Judge John H.
                    Stotsenburg in 1879 revised the State Statutes, a work which occupied three years. During his
                    lifetime Judge Stotsenburg wrote a great deal for magazines.</p>
            <p>Mr. William Vaughn Moody was a talented writer of verse, and several volumes of his work are in the
                    city library. Mr. Harvey Peake writes and illustrates articles for magazines. Mrs. Nellie Scribner
                    Middleton, daughter of Gen. Frank Scribner and granddaughter of Abner, one of the three Scribner
                    brothers, has written and published several books for childen. Mrs. Middleton was born and raised in <placeName>

                    Medical Society of the state of Indiana, met at Corydon on the 10th. The following gentlemen were
                    elected officers viz: President, Ashael Clapp, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>". This was away back in 1820 at the first meeting of the old time doctors and
                    surgeons of Indiana. Lo! and behold a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> doctor was made the head of the organization, over in that early time. The physicians
                    of our city have kept pace with the others of the state ever since. <pb n="238" id="VAA4025-017-3-028"/> At the present writing they are too numerous to mention. Doctors
                    perform more charity than any other profession of men, going about the city day and night
                    ministering to the wants of suffering humanity. Dr. Clapp, mentioned above, was a physician of
                    international reputation. Coming to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1817, he was the first of his profession here. He married Mary Scribner, daughter of
                    Joel, who only lived one year. He afterwards married the widow of Nathaniel Scribner. His son, Dr.
                    William A. Clapp, also practiced medicine in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> up to the time of his death in 1900. He served as surgeon of the Thirty-eighth Iridiana
                    regiment during the Civil war. Dr. Clapp's kindly face and cheery disposition will long be
                    remembered by many of the present generation.</p>

            <p>On June 29, 1816, by section 11 of article 11 of the constitution, the capital of the state of
                    Indiana was established at the town of Corydon in the county of Harrison to remain there until the
                    year 1825 and until removed by law. The territory now known as <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Floyd county</region>
                    </placeName>, was at that time embraced within the counties of Clark and Harrison. An act of the
                    General Assembly which took effect February 1, 1819, created the new political subdivision which was
                    thereafter to be known as <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Floyd county</region>
                    </placeName>. The county seat was temporarily fixed at the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and it was declared by the statute that the court should be holden at the house of
                    Seth Woodruff until suitable accommodations can be had in said county. It was not until the year
                    1823 that "The seat of Justice", as it was called, was permanently established at
                    the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> by the commissioners appointed by the act of January 10, 1823.</p>
            <p>Under the first constitution of the state the presiding justices of the circuit courts were appointed
                    by joint ballot of the General Assembly, and held their offices during the term of seven years,
                    "if they shall so long behave well." The state was divided into three judicial
                    circuits, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Floyd county</region>

            <p>Davis Floyd, a prominent citizen of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison county</region>
                    </placeName> and for whom the county was named, was made the first presiding justice of the Second
                    judicial circuit. As the day was warm this meeting' was held under a large spreading elm
                    tree which is still preserved, and was named "The Constitutional Elm." Judge Davis
                    Floyd was succeeded by John F. Ross in 1823; John H. Thompson, 1834; William T. Otto, 1845. The last
                    named remained in office until the general election 1852, under the new constitution, when being a
                    candidate for judge of the Second circuit he was defeated by Hon. George A. Bicknell. The latter
                    held the office for several successive terms, and so satisfactory was his administration of its
                    important duties that he was several times elected without opposition. Both Judge Otto and Judge
                    Bicknell were eastern men, and brought to the judicial station talent of the highest order, thorough
                    academic and university training and professional learning, that would have fitted them for any
                    judicial position under the state or federal government. Judge Bicknell was afterwards a member of
                    congress. Lawyers of distinguished ability and wide reputation have practiced in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Floyd county</region>
                    </placeName> circuit court ever since its organization, some of whom were Thomas Nelson, Isaac Hauk,
                    John M. Payne, James Collins, Randall Crawford, Ashbel P. Willard, Cyrus L. Dunham, John S. Davis,
                    Willett Bullitt, Thomas Gibson, Thomas L. Smith, Michael C. Kerr, George Vail Hauk and Walter Q.
                    Gresham. Many lawyers practicing in that court have been called to high positions under state and
                    federal government. Three of them became judges of the supreme court of Indiana; Ashbel P. Willard
                    was elected governor of the state; Cyrus L. Dunham was secretary of state and a member of congress,
                    Michael C. Kerr was reporter of the supreme court of Indiana for several terms, a member of
                    congress, and at the time of his death was Speaker of the national house of representatives; after a
                    brilliant career in the army during the Civil war, in which he was made a brigadier general, Walter
                    Q. Gresham was appointed judge of the district court of Indiana, and afterwards a judge of the
                    circuit court of the <placeName>

                    here in '46-'48, who fought gallantly in the war with Mexico. It was under the
                    command of Capt. W. F. Sanderson, who came home a colonel. Frank F. Scribner, son of Abner, was in
                    the company. In the Civil war the Twenty-third, Fiftieth and Fifty-third Indiana regiments were
                    organized in whole or in part in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>

                    Gresham and Cyrus L. Dunham. The Twenty-third had a brilliant record in the field, and its survivors
                    met every year in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in reunion to tell of the many engagements they were in during the four years of
                    unpleasantness. The regiment was with Grant in his campaign against Forts Henry and Donelson, at <placeName>

                    Indiana. Crossing the river some miles below Corydon, they passed through that town swapping their
                    worn out horses for fresh ones belonging <pb n="241" id="VAA4025-017-3-031"/> to the citizens,
                    without saying "by your leave". All the farmers who could, hid their horses, but
                    many were taken. When word reached <placeName>

                    </placeName> that they were headed for our town, the Home Guards started out, and it was supposed

            <p>The awakening interest in Indiana pioneer history, and those who made it, has brought, and is still

            <p>These passed from sire to eldest son under the old regime. Matthew Jacquelin Eggleston, a younger son
                    of William and Judith, received land near Locust Grove on which to build his home, as part of his
                    patrimony. In 1789 he married Nancy Cary Eggleston, only surviving child of John and Elizabeth Cary
                    Eggleston and located in <placeName>

                    one daughter were reared to maturity. These all lived to advanced age; two sons and two daughters
                    died in early youth.</p>
            <p>Miles Cary, the second of the thirteen children, was born February 26, 1791. His mother's
                    only brother died young, and in her centered the educational ambitions of her parents. The
                    advantages of home culture, tutors, schools and travel were showered on her in a measure seldom
                    bestowed on daughters, in those days. The English church was the faith of her fathers, and in this
                    she was reared. It was her pleasure to pass on to her children the best of all she had received.
                    They were her companions, and shared with her the religious, literary and cultural pursuits of a <placeName>

                    memorized by her and by the children from her recitation, and these were their familiar nursery
                    tales. Neither was the father disobedient to the educational vision, but fully shared the
                    responsibility of the moral and intellectual development of the youth of the family.</p>
            <p>Miles Cary Eggleston's early years of home nurture were followed by several years in the

            <p>On the completion of his law course in 1815, at the age of twenty-four, impelled by a deep conviction
                    of the wrong of slavery, the subject of this sketch left his native state and chose for his future
                    home Indiana territory, because it was irrevocably committed to anti-slavery doctrines by the
                    Ordinance of 1787. When in 1839 he came into his inheritance from his father, consisting largely of
                    slaves, he freed them all.</p>
            <p>He, only, of the large family of which he was a member, sought a northern home. The rest lived and
                    died in southern tide-water and gulf states, save for protracted sojourns with their northern
                    brother. The sister married Edv/ard Baptist, a Baptist minister, founder of the college of that
                    denomination in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>. Five brothers lived as southern gentlemen on their
                    plantations; three were professional men; Charles, a physician; Hugh, a lawyer and judge of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>; and Judge Miles Cary of Indiana.</p>
            <p>At that time, the Northwest territory was, so far as communication of all kinds was concerned,
                    further from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> than <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName> is today. Among the papers of Judge Eggleston is a letter from his father, written on
                    the death of his infant daughter, Virginia, in 1826, full of fatherly sympathy and Christian
                    consolation, which begins with the statement that the letter containing the "heart-breaking
                    message of the loss of the dear babe has just been received, <hi rend="i">fifteen days after
                        date."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The young home-seeker on crossing the border into free-soil territory entered at once the practice of
                    law at Lawrence-burg.</p>
            <pb n="247" id="VAA4025-017-3-037"/>
            <p>Statehood was trembling on the rise when he came to Indiana territory, and abundant reason existed
                    for trembling. The Napoleonic agitations were making the whole world nervous, with its currents in
                    America centering largely in the Northwest territory. Though the signing of the Treaty of Ghent,
                    December 24, 1814, closed the War of 1812, news of it traveled slowly. Through the early months of
                    1815 Indian warfare continued, fomented more or less by British influence. It was September 8, 1815,
                    that the Treaty of Spring Wells, near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was concluded, by which western Indian tribes agreed to place themselves under the
                    protection of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, "and no other power". The year 1816 was the first when peace was
                    actually established in the territory. This had weight which made it possible to carry statehood,
                    with all the wavering of the 64,000 tax-frightened inhabitants. The new status increased the
                    population in numbers, strengthened the scattered settlements, relieved instead of increasing
                    taxation, and the promise of great prosperity which surrounded the infant state was speedily
                    realized.</p>
            <p>This transition brought to the young southerner ample material reward for his heroic renunciation of
                    his old home for the sake of principle. Still, frontier conditions were on every side, villages were
                    few, and these were filled with Indians, not always dependably friendly,–trading game,
                    peltries, quill adorned moccasins for trinkets such as the settlers possessed. The people were a
                    hardy, reckless fron tier population, relying on their own prowess, and the strong arm of the law to
                    right the crimes in which they more or less gloried. Virginian of the Virginians as he was, he often
                    had to adapt himself anew to conditions, but he had acquainted himself with them as far as possible,
                    and they disturbed him less than he did them apparently. Queues and moccasins marked the social
                    etiquette of the floor of the court,–the ruffled shirt front and immaculate white stock
                    of the judge on the bench jarred it quite perceptibly. This was his invariable attire, and the
                    memory of it is preserved by a portrait of him, now one hundred years old, painted in 1821, the year
                    before his marriage, still as fresh as when it came from the artist's brush.</p>
            <pb n="248" id="VAA4025-017-3-038"/>
            <p>In the contact of the polished Virginian and the frontiersmen from everywhere, two civilizations met,
                    mending the latter, and not marring the former. He would well have fitted the Indiana of today, but
                    filled the need of the Indiana of that date.</p>
            <p>Physically he was of average height and weight, with abundant brown hair which in age showed scarce a
                    shadow of turning gray; his blue eyes keen and laughing; his complexion fair, with a glow of
                    healthful color; his habits always temperate, his gastronomic tastes those of an epicure; his smooth
                    shaven face, and teeth regular and unsullied by tobacco, which he used in no form, gave him to the
                    last a youthful appearance. This is the testimony of his family, who say also that he was never
                    known to raise his voice, or otherwise lose his poise, considering gentlemanly demeanor the part of
                    the man of culture as surely as of the judge on the bench. Statements occasionally published that he
                    was small in stature, somewhat eccentric; of delicate health, and at times inclined to be pedantic
                    are the nearest approach to criticisms of him, and they are not of importance, but are without
                    foundation in fact,–made perhaps originally by unlettered frontiersmen of more brawn than
                    brain, who had not the power to comprehend the man of letters, himself a student, and of a long line
                    of lettered men and women.</p>
            <p>Hunting and riding behind the hounds possessed for him an irresistible fascination. To within a short
                    time of his death, at the age of sixty years, the bay of the hound on the trail of a fox, or the
                    bark of a dog after a treed coon brought him to the saddle at any hour of the day or night, and no
                    one gloried in the chase more than he. His failing health in latter years was due to excessive
                    devotion to his profession, and the exposure it entailed in earlier years, under pioneer conditions.</p>
            <p>He entered the practice of law at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>

                            courage were above suspicion, while his impartiality commended him to the approbation of all
                            He will long be remembered by the writer, one of the younger members of the profession, for
                            the judge was ever willing to hear all that could be said by the humblest member of the bar,
                            and when he decided, even against him, his manner gave courage to increase preparation for
                            the next case. I received my license to practice law from his hand, and after a short
                            examination in person. His remarks in signing the license made a deep impression on me. My
                            means were exhausted, and it was a matter of life or death with me. The judge kindly
                            remarked: "Mr. Smith, I will sign your license, but you are only prepared to
                            commence the study of law; don't be discouraged, but persevere in your studies, and

            <p>The frequent re-districting of the state brought new counties into the Third district, and the family
                    residence was changed as business demanded. It was in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. During Judge Eggleston's residence in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> he was joined by his cousin, Joseph Cary Eggleston, also of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, who having read law in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> came as he had done, to a free state as a protest against slavery. His four children,
                    Edward, George Cary, Jane Lowry (Mrs. Charles Zimmerman, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evanston</settlement>

                  <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, were born

                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In 1838, Judge Eggleston accepted the professorship of law on the faculty of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> college. In 1842 he resigned the chair, as the double duties of college professor and
                    circuit judge became too arduous for his years; he was then a man of fifty-three. In 1844, he
                    resigned the judgeship, but continued the practice of law, being admitted to the bar of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson county</region>
                    </placeName>, March 24, 1845.</p>
            <p>After a short residence in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, '42-'46, he bought a farm at Dupont, the southern high lands of the
                    state being then considered the only healthful region in which to locate.</p>
            <pb n="251" id="VAA4025-017-3-041"/>
            <p>His brothers, who had acquired wealth, and lived easily on their plantations used every persuasion to
                    induce him to buy land in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and slaves to till it, and spend the remainder of his life in ease, but his devotion to
                    his chosen profession, and his anti-slavery principles were as unswerving in age as they had been in
                    youth, and he could not consent to return to life under the old condition.</p>
            <p>Years of close application to professional duties and exposures during the quarter of a century he
                    rode the circuit under pioneer requirements had impaired his health. Leaving the farm in the care of
                    his wife and elder son he went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                    </placeName> Springs, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, for the heated term of 1851. He was accompanied by his younger son, who tenderly cared
                    for him, the end coming unexpectedly while there, July 19, 1851. He was buried from the home of his
                    daughter in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where in 1915 her life closed, just one hundred years after his coming to Indiana, the
                    last of his immediate family. He lies buried in the family lot in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fairmount</settlement>
                    </placeName> cemetery, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In the above home, and in others within a radius of less than a quarter of a mile, live three
                    generations of the descendants of Judge Eggleston.</p>
            <p>In 1851 the state was in its prime; in 1815 when he adopted it as his home it was in its infancy.
                    Through its formative period his influence had done much to determine the character of its
                    judiciary, and there is abundant evidence that the bar of Indiana ranks high among those of the
                    states of the Union.</p>
            <p>The Third judicial circuit when he was its presiding judge included about half the state, the whole
                    Whitewater district from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson county</region>
                    </placeName> to the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> north and south, from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> state line to <geogName>White river</geogName>, two hundred miles by seventy-five in
                    extent. It was an unbroken stretch of Indian-haunted wilderness; silent, somber, solemn; timbered
                    till daylight was dark as night beneath the shadowing boughs of this forest primeval.</p>
            <p>In the whole territory there was not a road, not a bridged stream. The circuit must be ridden twice a
                    year, when court was in session, regardless of weather. Sometimes floods made the streams
                    dangerously full for the horses to swim, <pb n="252" id="VAA4025-017-3-042"/> but swim they must. At
                    times the horse lost his footing and horse and rider both must swim, and ride for hours perhaps,
                    carrying watersoaked saddlebags with their dripping contents. Again drouth dried the streams till
                    search for drinking water for horse and rider was a weary one. The prosecuting attorney and other
                    lawyers rode the circuit with the judge. Among them was a <hi rend="i">bonne camaraderie</hi> which
                    cemented friendship through the years, and to which thanks are due for many a pen picture of men of
                    the past. There was protection in numbers, though Indians and frontiersmen alike, were often in the
                    clutches of the law and held the court in a certain reverent awe which was its own protection.</p>
            <p>Judge Eggleston had a keen sense of humor, was cheerful and companionable. He was sensitive to a
                    degree which caused him to suffer acutely when a death sentence was pending in court, yet he never
                    shirked a duty to shield himself. As many as nine penitentiary sentences and four for capital
                    punishment are reported on one circuit.</p>
            <p>The sentence of Hudson for the massacre of a peaceful party of Seneca Indians on the banks of Fall
                    creek in 1824, was pronounced by Judge Wick, but the trial of the other three murderers was in Judge
                    Eggleston's court. Oliver H. Smith tells us that as the boy, his father, and his
                    mother's brother, stood before him to receive the death sentence, "The face of the
                    Judge was pale, his lips quivered, his tongue faltered as he addressed the prisoners." The
                    sentence of death by hanging was pronounced, but the usual conclusion, "And may God have
                    mercy on your soul" was left struggling for utterance. At the final moment, after
                    witnessing the execution of his father and uncle, Governor James B. Ray pardoned the boy. The
                    historian writing in 1857 adds, "Thus ended the only trial where convictions of murder were
                    ever had, followed by execution of white men for the murder of Indians in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>."</p>
            <p>Politically Judge Eggleston was a <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> man, but absolutely fair. He named a son for him, and when Henry Clay spoke in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> he introduced the speaker, yet he stoutly maintained in open court that he believed
                    that a Jacksonian was just as honest as a <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> man, and would no more perjure himself to aquit a Jackson man than a <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> man would to <pb n="253" id="VAA4025-017-3-043"/> convict him. He was on the bench of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin county</region>
                    </placeName> court when a prisoner was fined one thousand dollars for calling a man a Federalist.
                    The entire court agreed that to call a man a Federalist was libelous, and actionable.</p>
            <p>In religion as in law Judge Eggleston was a man of genuine convictions and broad views. Reared in the
                    Episcopal faith; educated at William and Mary college when it was under control of that denomination
                    he continued his connection with it; was a member of Christ's Church congregation, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and a vestryman of the parish. As in politics he was free from bigotry. His attitude
                    toward life was one of serene content. His life had been a well ordered, successful one, a fact that
                    he and his contemporaries could not fail to recognize.</p>
            <p>This is evidenced by unquestionably honest expressions of it while he lived and through the near
                    three quarters of a century since his day. John Lyle King, a lawyer of ability, known more or less
                    throughout Indiana and in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, says: "Foremost on the bench of the circuit court of eastern Indiana was
                    Miles Cary Eggleston, an acute, learned and incorruptible judge." William Wesley Woolen
                    spoke of him as a good lawyer, and one who never forgot the dignity of his station.</p>
            <p>From an old manuscript of John M. Johnson, an old time resident of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>

                        <p>Miles C. Eggleston, perhaps the leading jurist at that day, and about whom the historians say
                            remarkably little, although he was presiding judge of the Third judicial circuit for more
                            than twenty-one years, was a good-looking gentleman, rather below the middle size, with a
                            good head, leaning a little to one side; with ruffles protruding from his shirt bosom, well
                            dressed. ∗ ∗ ∗ He had a liberal education, and was a good
                            Latin scholar; he was not a great advocate before a jury but eminently qualified for a
                            judge, and was justly regarded as the best in the state. His charges to the jury were clear
                            and clothed in fine language, and listened to with the utmost attention. The people of the
                            county had such implicit confidence in him that they would quote his decisions before those
                            of the Supreme court.<hi rend="sup">∗ ∗ ∗</hi> He observed
                            the utmost decorum in court, and made the lawyers keep their places. There was no slipping
                            to the judge with a paper and holding a private conversation, and no lawyers leaning on each
                            corner of the judge's seat.</p>

                        <p>It is with no little pleasure I acknowledge the receipt of your last letter today. It
                                    is in every way gratifying. It evinces that you have been both attentive to your
                                    studies, and sensible of the advantages you can and ought to derive from the
                                    opportunities you possess with your capable instructors, and your intercourse with
                                    the sensible and amiable lady who watches over the education of your heart and
                                    manners,–a consciousness of this other value of it is the first step to
                                    real permanent improvement.</p>
                        <p>I am glad to hear you speak of the heart as well as of the head. A woman without a
                                    heart, a warm "glowing heart of sympathy" is a something which can
                                    just be tolerated, nothing more. If nature has not endowed her with a sympathetic
                                    temperament she should from policy try to counterfeit a lively sensibility to the
                                    interests, joys and sorrows of others. The show of this, like sterner
                                    sentimentalities is, more winning and will make friends, if not lovers. I felicitate
                                    you on the improvement of your style and orthography. This is very visible. You now
                                    write <hi rend="i">currante calamo,</hi> smoothly, and easily to yourself and
                                    reader, –the great beauty of epistolary writing. If one knows the English
                                    grammar well, and the right sense of words one can have little perplexity in writing
                                    well,–with reading and conversation. We all know the belle-lettre
                                    languages, <hi rend="i">tant mieux,</hi> they may serve as ornaments, like fine
                                    ribbons, or jewels in an Indian's nose, or a garnish to an insipid dish.</p>
                        <p>I acknowledge that you have just cause for complaint against your brother for not
                                    writing to you. His apology is,–how true I don't know, that you
                                    show his letters even when he intends them to be confidential. If he is not
                                    mistaken, you have erred. The confidence of private friendship should be kept
                                    sacred. This is a high point of honor with the world. Private letters which contain
                                    our nearest and dearest secrets, which come "warm from the heart, and
                                    faithful to its fire," are never to be exposed to the scrutiny and
                                    criticism of others, unless with the consent of the writer. There are some friends
                                    we may allow to read them, or some part of them, without impropriety, unless

                                    for complaint. He is from home now. He went last week with Cousin Joe to <placeName>

                                    absent some time at a watering place, but returned <pb n="255" id="VAA4025-017-3-045"/> too soon, and took the epidemic. He says it has cost
                                    him about one thousand dollars, which a few fees this fall will soon make up. He
                                    still defies the assaults of "awful beauty," even when it
                                    "puts on all its arms,"–patches, paintings, laces and
                                    all that.</p>
                        <p>Some, it would seem, prefer philosophy to a Juliet. It may be they take it as an

                        <p>Mr. Paine's great pork house, near the river, with four others, burned last
                                    week–a great deal of pork and lard lost. Pitcher lost about one thousand

                                    your conduct and behavior. She is, I doubt not, a most estimable lady and
                                    preceptress for young ladies. Her feeling is more maternal than I had thought, even,
                                    and therefore of more value to you. Can't you approach her more confidently
                                    and freely as a daughter, a kind mother, and catch the glowing spontaneous effusions
                                    of her sympathetic heart to comfort and console you in your homesick hours. It would
                                    teach much–of more worth than books. <hi rend="i">Mauvais honte</hi> is a
                                    vulgar feeling and should be subdued, if possible,–it acknowledges an
                                    inferiority, which you ought to feel to no one, unless for higher worth and wisdom.
                                    Return to the lady for me, my sincere thanks for her kind interest, and her
                                    attention to you.</p>
                        <p>We shall find some suitable way to have you with us at Christmas. We want? to see you
                                    as "awfully" as you want to see us. Your mother will give you her
                                    reason for not writing when she sees you. She says to tell you it is not because she
                                    does not love you. She tells me to send her love by this. Henry is well. He took
                                    your letter to the window and read it with a smiling face. He is now out among the

                            </placeName> from <placeName>

                            quoted fragments of his speeches.</p>
                        <p>One cold winter night a small party of <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                            </placeName>'s "prominent citizens" were gathered around the
                            stove in a store on Main Cross street (it then was), Judge Eggleston being one of the
                            number. Several of them were professional men, and each in turn paid tribute to his chosen
                            calling. Judge Eggleston sat apart, his hat pulled down over his eyes (which shows their
                            manners were much as those of the present day).</p>
                        <p>They spoke out of a cloud of tobacco smoke. I'm not sure Judge Eggleston smoked; I
                            know my uncle did. It isn't easy to remember what somebody said some one else was
                            doing at a particular time more than sixty years ago.</p>
                        <p>Presently it was the Judge's turn to speak, and there fell upon the ears of his
                            listeners in that smoke-filled, tallow-candle-lighted room, such a magnificent spontaneous
                            tribute to his profession–such a flood of eloquence as many a time had moved his
                            hearers and influenced stern-visaged jurors to render a verdict directly opposing their
                            previous convictions. I regret that only the closing words of his fine peroration remain in
                            my memory:</p>
                        <p>"The Law is the light of the land! It illumines the palace of the rich, and shines
                            in the coinage of the poor! It guards the hovel and the throne, and watches by the cradle
                            and the grave! It is the Avenger of Wrong, the Strength of Age, and the Protector of
                            Innocence! It arms the weak with power, and wrests from Wealth its unrighteous
                            immunity!"</p>
                        <p>It is twenty years since I heard these words,–repeated by one who heard them
                            spoken before I was born. But today when I see or hear the name of Judge Eggleston, his
                            splendid tribute to the majesty of the Law stands out in letters of light against the shadow
                            of oblivion that wraps his eloquence.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The second most important case during the decade before the Civil war was the West or Weston case.
                    The litigation over West differed from that over Freeman in many particulars. West was a fugitive
                    who had been captured by his master's slave hunter in the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. The trial happened in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> because of the legal action taken by a company of abolition lawyers led by such men as
                    George W. Julian, John Coburn and others. West was being taken through the city on his return to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, when legal battle was commenced by these abolition leaders for his liberty. He was
                    not, therefore, a resident of the city, nor was it ever disclosed that he was or ever had been a
                    free man because of any free papers. He seems to have been known to no one in the city excepting the
                    colored population, who appeared to be much exercised and excited by his arrest. Some of these
                    talked a great deal of rescuing West, but he was finally lodged in jail to await a hearing. The
                    contest was purely a legal battle throughout. The abolitionist lawyers had planned to do one of
                    three things, if possible. First, they intended to do their best to liberate West. Second, they were
                    for attempting a rescue, if they should fail legally to liberate him. As a corollary, they had it in
                    mind to delay action in the trial in every possible way in order to make it cost the claimant the
                    value of his slave or more. By making it cost the claimant a great deal, the abolitionists felt that
                    they could discourage slave hunting in Indiana, and at the same time make every slave master fear to
                    return with his fugitive through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, because of the intimidation he might be sure to encounter from them. All the
                    abolitionists of the city, and they were numerous, both lawyers and non-professionals did their work
                    gratuitously for the purpose of defeating the fugitive slave law and because of their hatred of the
                    institution of slavery. Julian, their <pb n="258" id="VAA4025-017-3-048"/> acknowledged leader, had
                    been in the house of representatives when the bill passed congress. He had voted against it and had,
                    ever since its adoption, denounced it. He had been the free soil representative from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> district and the leader of abolitionism at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Centerville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the old county seat of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne county</region>
                    </placeName>, before coming to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to practice law.</p>
            <p>West was the slave claimed by Austin W. Vallandingham of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. As has been said, Vallandingham's agent had captured West in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and was passing through the city on his way to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> over the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> railroad. While resting here with his captured slave, waiting for a train to bear him
                    to the southern shores of the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>, proceedings were instituted, in the
                    city courts, against Vallandingham on the charge of kidnapping a free negro.</p>
            <p>The lawyers for the claimant were J. Roberts, R. L. Walpole, and T. D. Walpole. Those prosecuting the
                    case werd Ellsworth and Colley, John Coburn and George W. Julian. The case was tried in the court of
                    Judge William J. Wallace, in December, 1857. The affidavit was filed in this court by Samuel
                    Williams, a colored man.</p>
            <p>When court convened to hear the case, the lawyers began wrangling as to whether Williams, a mulatto,
                    could file an affidavit against a white man. Ellsworth said that an affidavit might be filed by a
                    negro, a mulatto, or an Indian. The testimony to establish the facts sworn to in the affidavit was
                    on the trial of the cause. He continued: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>A negro might file his affidavit making a charge, while on the hearing of the cause, he might
                            be excluded from giving testimony against a white man. As to the residence of the negro, it
                            was not material at what time he got into the state, or what penalties were imposed upon him
                            for coming in, he was here and feeling himself aggrieved, wronged and insulted he had filed
                            the affidavit. He must be heard in any court throughout the state of Indiana. Whether the
                            negro, Samuel Williams, had been in the state one day, or one year, or five years, he was
                            entitled, whether regarded as a citizen or not, to sue for justice against aggression.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>

                </p>
            <p>T. D. Walpole said that the testimony of Williams, a negro, was incompetent and illegal where a white
                    man was an interested party and that he could not testify unless by the consent of the parties
                    interested and such consent had never been given. Further he asked: <list type="footnotes">

                            violence had been done to him individually. The right of a negro or of a mulatto to
                            institute a proceeding in the courts of Indiana, coming as the negro Williams did into the
                            state since 1857 in contravention of the constitution, is denied. He has no rights whatever
                            in our courts where his own person had not been infringed. He is a violator of the laws of
                            Indiana. He is no part of the sovereignty of Indiana. He is excluded from the state and he
                            came into it in defiance of the constitution which his honor had sworn to maintain and
                            support. No outside nigger could come into any Indiana court filing such an affidavit as

            <p>It was up to Judge Wallace to decide this wrangle concerning the affidavit of Samuel Williams. This
                    he did in the following four points: <list type="ordered">
                  <item>(1) At common law, negroes, unless slaves, are universally allowed to testify. A
                            man's color has nothing to do with his testimony.</item>
                  <item>(2) Common law rights or natural rights may be restricted by an express statute, but such
                            restrictive statutes are to be strictly construed. Just the restriction they give is to be
                            taken but no more.</item>
                  <item>(3) The Indiana statute of 1853 prohibits negroes having one-eighth or more of negro
                            blood, from testifying as a witness in a cause and no more. Being a witness is one thing and
                            simply filing an affidavit is another and different thing and the true rule is undoubtedly
                            laid down by Judge McDonald as follows: "In all cases, both civil and criminal,
                            where affidavits are necessary, either for the institution of a suit or its continuance, or
                            for any other purpose whatever, such affidavit may be made by an Indian, a negro or
                            mulatto."</item>
                  <item>(4) Our supreme court has decided, "That the state is not a person of any
                            particular color." Now, the object of an affidavit, in cases of felony is to inform
                            the state that an offense has been committed against her and her laws, and as the state is
                            of no color, it matters not what may be the color of the one who informs her by affidavit.
                            The state has a right to demand and receive information, under oath, of offenses against
                            her, from any source whatever.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>

                    trial for thirty days on the affidavit of Williams. The court overruled the motion for a continuance
                    and this seemed to please Vallandingham, because shortening the time meant less expense to him. When
                    the Court reconvened in the afternoon R. L. Walpole appeared with Vallandingham. Ellsworth appeared
                    for the state. Major Wallace announced his determination to go into the case. The state through
                    Ellsworth entered a <hi rend="i">nolle prosequi,</hi> finished the matter and the negro was
                    discharged.</p>
            <p>After his discharge by Judge Wallace, West was arrested by Jesse D. Carmichael, <placeName>

                    </placeName> commissioner John H. Rea. The same attorneys were acting that had participated in the
                    kidnapping trial preceding. West now had to prove himself a free man. T. D. Walpole opened for the
                    claimant, saying that the case was a question of proving the validity of the proceedings of the
                    claim-and capture of West. To warrant extradition this was all that was necessary.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Coburn moved to quash the warrant, on the ground that there was no allegation in the indictment
                    showing that West was Vallandingham's slave at the time of his escape. He said that the
                    documents issued by the court of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Franklin county</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, for identification were not proper
                    certificates and they were without seals. Walpole contended that seals and certificates were not
                    necessary in the case. All that was needed was identification and a warrant.</p>
            <p>Julian said the affidavit was defective, because the name of the negro was not given, but was
                    supposed to be West or Weston. Further it did not show that West escaped from <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Vallandingham and his agents had wrongfully deprived the alleged slave of his liberty
                    and had violated the constitution of Indiana in bringing a negro into the state, for the
                    constitution, article XIII, section I, specifically says, "No negro or mulatto shall come
                    into or settle in the state, after the adoption of this constitution."</p>

                    signatures and certificates attached. Julian contended that the form was wrong, that there was no

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. "The uncertainty of the name of the alleged slave was very probable evidence
                    that the claimant had wilfully sworn to a lie."</p>
            <p>The court overruled the motion to quash the warrant and stated that "whatever might be the
                    defect in the case he would hear evidence to prove the claimant's right to the alleged
                    slave, and not deliver him to the reputed owner without the owner proving that the negro owed him
                        service?<hi rend="sup">56</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Coburn argued that West was a free man, because he had been and was now on free soil. He claimed that
                    West had worked on a. steamboat, called Blue Wings, which had plied up and down the <geogName>Ohio
                        river</geogName> and had landed at different points in Indiana. He was, therefore, under the
                    civil and criminal jurisdiction of Indiana and as Indiana's constitution prohibited slavery
                    and involuntary servitude he was a free man. West had ‘been brought into Indiana. by his
                    master while working on the steamboat ten years before, he was again brought into Indiana by action
                    of his master and "the moment a slave touches our soil he becomes free."</p>
            <p>Coburn said: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    proceeded to lambast Vallandingham, his counsel and the court and to arouse public sentiment,
                    probably for a rescue. The speeches made, show plainly this intention. They were purely abolitionist
                    in tone, temper and spirit and were made for the public, not especially for the defense of West.</p>
            <p>T. D. Walpole, at the conclusion of the testifying, argued that the evidence of identity was

                            into the dust, he now had little hope. From all that had been observed it was evident that

                            of toil under the lash of a master and to go hence to that home from which it is to be hoped
                            that no slave ever returns to endure the misery of a plantation life. The counsel for the

                            here as required by the laws of his state. The testimony that Dr. Vallandingham had cut off
                            the first joint of West's forefinger for a felon was falacious, as any one could

            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>The case was a question of veracity between Vallandingham and the alleged fugitive. West swore
                        that he was not Vallandingham's slave and Vallandingham swore that he was. West could
                        give a reason why he was not a slave, but old man Vallandingham could not give a reason why he
                        was a slave. That was the difference between them. There was reason with West, but none with
                        Vallandingham. The claimant might object to occupy a position of equality with a negro in
                        Indiana, but it would be a very exalted one for him to occupy. We sung Psalms on Sunday, and
                        played on our organs and prayed, "Our Father who art in Heaven" and if that
                        Father was just and holy, as he believed him to be, he would consign the man who sent the nigger
                        back to bondage to the very lowest bottomless hell that could possibly be imagined. A man might
                        just as well hope to get out of the bottomless pit of hell by a jury trial, and have the

                        and telling him that God Almighty had decreed that he should be damned forever. This was a

                    convened in the hall of the house of representatives to hear this case. West was brought into court

            <p>Coburn denied that the certificate was sufficient evidence to make West the slave of Vallandingham,
                    because he had not been proven to be a slave of anyone. He claimed that a certificate had been given
                    on insufficient grounds. West had had no chance to get a fair trial before the commissioner. They
                    had asked for three weeks' time in which to secure witnesses to prove that West was a free
                    man. This had been overruled and he could not procure testimony for a proper trial. The claimant had
                    failed to identify the man, and he must not be permitted to be taken off until a satisfactory proof
                    had been made that he was the slave of any one.</p>
            <p>After these explanations, the court stated that West was in the custody of the deputy marshal, and
                    that he would take charge of him and appear before the court at nine o'clock the next

            <p>The court convened the next morning at the appointed time in the house of representatives, when Judge
                    Wallace delivered his decision in the case. He said: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Mr. Julian, in one of his speeches in the commissioner's court, had suggested the rescue of
                    West and had intimated that he would not be averse to giving aid in such an act against the
                    iniquitous slave law, since he believed the negro was a free man. In accordance with this
                    announcement a plan was adopted. Julian and about a dozen others were implicated in the plot. On the
                    day the negro was to be taken south two or three men were to enter the jail and bid the negro
                    goodbye, and others were to engage the marshal in continuous conversation. A free negro was to have
                    a horse hitched nearby in readiness for West to escape. The marshal came for West in a buggy. While
                    he was on the ground adjusting the reins of the horse and talking, West made his break for liberty.
                    He made for the horse he thought appointed for him, but mounted the wrong one. He was awkward and
                    clumsy and the horse he rode was a poor one. Carmichael discovering that his prisoner was taking to

                    Christian university. Carmichael, in his pursuit, was not out of sight of West except as the latter

                    him, neither of them taking effect. Being frightened by the discharge of the pistol, West
                    surrendered himself to the deputy marshal, who brought him back to the city. In connection with this
                    attempted rescue, Julian said of himself, in his <hi rend="i">Recollections</hi>: This is the only
                    felony in which I was ever involved, but none of the parties to it had any disposition whatever to
                    confess it at the time."</p>
            <p>Julian and his friends had not succeeded in their undertaking. They had done their best to free West.
                    Had the law permitted the court to be judicial instead of purely ministerial in its functions, they
                    probably would have succeeded, for they presented good argument for his freedom. But the law limited
                    the proceedings of the case, and their "free soil, free man" argument could not
                    obtain. They had failed to free him or to rescue him. They did succeed in making it costly for the
                    claimant. Dr. Vallandingham had to pay $750 to get West through the courts at <placeName>

                    </placeName>. This added to the expense of his capture at <placeName>

                    that Julian and his company of abolition friends wished to accomplish, if they failed to secure him
                    his liberty.</p>
            <p>On the Saturday following the trial, West was taken to the Palmer House, where he was cleaned up and
                    dressed in respectable clothes which had been bought from a collection which had been taken up for

            <p>This was the last great case before the tragedy of civil war fell upon the country. People were
                    getting more bitter in their denunciations of the slave law and the institution of slavery. The <hi rend="i">State Journal</hi> which had said little or nothing in the days of the Freeman trial
                    was now hurling its keen shafts against slavery. The Republican party had been born and its

                    were as active as ever. The churches of all denominations were now busy opposing the fugitive law.
                    Ministers were urging opposition to the law and were picturing the horrors of slavery. The West
                    case, increased the heat of the flame. The preachers of the city <pb n="270" id="VAA4025-017-3-060"/> denounced the decision. Rev. J. B. Simmons, a Baptist minister, said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>West did not have a fair trial. He himself had heard the commissioner say that if

                            for them to be sent for. The commissioner received the master's testimony and
                            excluded the fugitives. Could he not have extended the time of the trial to give West a fair
                            chance for liberty? There was no protection to the black man. Any of them could be picked up
                            in our streets and be carried off by the same process which consigned West to slavery.</p>

            <p>The first case ever tried in Indiana under the new fugitive slave law, was at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There happened to be living in that city then a woman about fifty-five years of age,
                    her daughter about thirty-five years old and a son of the latter who was probably about seven or
                    eight years of age. The three had come to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, and had lived for about four months in the city,
                    the little boy going to school with the white children, while his mother and grandmother worked.
                    They were peacefully and happily living in the city, when one day there appeared before Squire
                    Jocelyn, a man by the name of Dennis Framell of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName>, who charged that the three people were his fugitive slaves. A warrant being filed
                    before the commissioner, they were all three arrested and thrown into jail to await their trial.
                    This case aroused the people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> to a high pitch of excitement, because to all appearances, the alleged fugitives were
                    white persons. In the trial the next day, the oldest woman said she was a native of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName>, that many years ago her husband had been killed by the Indians, that she and her
                    daughter had been carried away captive and that none of them were ever held as slaves. There seems
                    to have been no trouble on the part of the claimant in proving them to be his property. In the
                    meantime some one had appealed the case by a writ of <hi rend="i">habeas corpus</hi> to the <placeName>

                    procured from the former residents of the alleged <pb n="271" id="VAA4025-017-3-061"/> fugitives.

                            appear to regret the event which has separated them. Our information states that she had
                            never told her husband that she was a slave. The old man is represented as being deeply in
                            distress for the loss of his wife, and it is said that he is about taking some steps to try
                            to reclaim her, alleging that the man who made the arrest showed no authority for doing so.</p>

                            appears to us that it would be wisdom on the part of our citizens in that neighborhood not
                            to interfere in the matter. We already have difficulties and dangers enough to encounter

            <p>The first prosecution in this state for a violation of that section of the act of 1850 for harboring
                    a slave, occurred in December, 1854. The case was between Mr. Marsh, deputy marshal, and Benjamin B.
                    Waterhouse. He was prosecuted by Marsh as a violator of the seventh section of the fugitive act.
                    This section provided for imprisonment for six months, a fine of $1,000, and civil
                    damages to the amount of $1,000 to the claimant for obstructing the arrest, attempting a
                    rescue, or harboring a fugitive after notice. It was on the last part of the act that the case was
                    instituted. Waterhouse was accused of having harbored two slaves belonging to Daniel Payne whose
                    names were Tom and Jim, aged respectively 23 and 20 or 21. George W. Julian and E. H. Brackett acted
                    for the defense and the district attorney and R. W. Thompson acted as prosecutors in the case. The

            <p>One of Mrs. Haviland's confederates in the work of rescuing the unfortunate colored people,
                    was Calvin Fairbank. Fairbank was a New Yorker by birth and a descendant of old English stock. He

                    known for its anti-slavery sentiments and teachings. His steady and tender nature led him to seek
                    the ministry as a vocation and he was soon ordained an elder in the Methodist Episcopal church and
                    given a license to preach. It was while attending quarterly meeting, when a boy, with his father and
                    mother that he heard a sad story told one night at the fireside of a pair of escaped slaves. The
                    negro woman recounted her history for a period of thirty years, how she had been sold from home and
                    separated from her husband and family. This story told in his youth had the same effect upon him

                    slavery was fixed upon me." During his life he gave full execution to this resolve, for he

            <p>Fairbank was operating south of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> in conjunction with Miss Delia A. Webster, who was teaching school at

                  <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. Miss Webster co-operated fully with Fair-bank in his work of
                    rescuing the slaves, and in the end suffered much persecution for her work.</p>
            <p>On a September day in 1844 Fairbank met a negro by the name of Lewis Hayden. Hayden was seeking
                    freedom for himself and his family. Upon being asked why he wished freedom he replied that he wished
                    to be a man. Fairbank soon took the case in hand and in company with Miss Webster, they had the
                    Hayden family in a hack on the way to the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>. After losing a horse and
                    securing another, they escaped safely across into the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, where they made safe connections with the Underground Railroad. Fairbank and Miss
                    Webster returned to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, where both of them were immediately put in jail. At the trial both were convicted,
                    though there was no evidence produced against them, and sent to the" penitentiary at
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Frankfort</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. Fairbank was sentenced to imprisonment for fifteen years.
                    While he was incarcerated his father came to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> with a petition, signed by many people in <placeName>

               </placeName>, for his
                    release. While he was endeavoring to secure such clemency, he was taken ill of cholera, from which
                    he died. He was buried among strangers at <placeName>

               </placeName>. However, in a short time
                    Fair-bank was pardoned by John J. Crittenden, the governor of that state at that time. After

                    hygienically done, and as Indiana was in a hot contest over her constitutional amendment prohibiting
                    negroes to settle within its limits, he concluded to come to our state and use his influence against
                    it. He was campaigning in the lower tier of counties, when he was appealed to to rescue a young
                    mulatto girl named Tamar, who was about to be sold from the block. He consented to aid her and
                    crossed over the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in an old leaky skiff. He secured Tamar who, with a tin cup, dipped the water from the
                    boat, while Fairbank, with a board, paddled the boat across to the Indiana shore near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In a short time, they were speeding on their way toward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, where Tamar was placed in safe hands. Fairbank returned by rail and on foot
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> with the intention of going after his father's body. While at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> he was attacked and kidnapped into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> by A. L. Shotwell, and marshals Ronald and Hamlet of that state. The sheriff of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark county</region>
                    </placeName> permitted Fairbank to be taken from his hands in direct violation of the law of the
                    land. Shotwell was Tamar's master and was very anxious to get Fairbank into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. The methods used to secure this end did not bother his conscience in the least.
                    Fairbank was again lodged in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> jail foi five months to await his trial, which was held before Judge Bullock. No
                    evidence was given against Fairbank that proved him guilty of aiding in the escape of a slave, but
                    he was, nevertheless, convicted and sentenced to fifteen years' hard labor in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> penitentiary. The whole affair was a sham, a travesty to justice, it having been
                    prearranged what the outcome should be. Fairbank did not have a single witness in his behalf nor
                    could any be procured for him because of the excitement that then existed over the death of an
                    anti-slave worker by the name of Conklin, who had been tied with ropes and thrown into the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, for attempting the rescue of a negro woman and her four children. Everything was
                    against his liberation.</p>
            <p>During his term of imprisonment, he was subjected to the most brutal, wicked and inhuman treatment
                    conceivable. At his first entry of the prison, the profits arising from the labor <pb n="279" id="VAA4025-017-3-069"/> of the prisoners was divided between the state and the warden, the
                    warden furnishing one-third of the expenses and sharing one-third the profits. Each prisoner was
                    allotted so much work to be done each day, which was all that a strong man could do working at top
                    speed. Fairbank was not a strong man and soon proved incapable of doing his task. He was then
                    subjected to the most horrible and cruel punishment ever doled out in modern time. He was put at the
                    hardest, dirtiest work possible and orders to that effect were given by Capt. Newton Craig, the
                    warden, in the following words, "Mr. Davis, take Fairbank to the hackling house and kill
                    him." They had to labor from daylight until dark. Their food consisted of old fat greasy
                    bacon and corn bread mixed with hot water. Coffee consisted of burnt rye, the grounds of which were
                    boiled over and over until they spoiled. Their beds consisted of a pile of dirty straw, with swarms
                    of fleas and bed bugs for bed fellows. It was at this time that Fairbank sent word by a negro, who
                    had been liberated from prison, to Levi Coffin and Dr. Brisbane at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> telling them of his deplorable state, and asking them to send him aid or he would
                    perish. The necessary means were provided but to get the things to Fair-bank was the problem. Laura
                    Haviland came to the home of Coffin at this time and hearing of the sad condition of Fair-bank,
                    volunteered to go to his assistance. Dr. Brisbane feared for her to go at this time, but she
                    insisted on going. Preparing her trunk with comforts and underwear, she crossed the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. After much delay she was admitted to see Fairbank and bore to him some money and
                    articles of comfort. It was learned that she was delayed because she was suspected to be Miss
                    Webster, a woman who was greatly feared and hated by the slave holders. When they were fully assured
                    that she was not Miss Webster she was allowed to see the prisoner and was finally permitted to
                    return to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. She tells of the excitement her visit aroused. She said that as she was passing along
                    the streets she overheard a clump of men talking. One said, "great excitement in town, hear
                    that another woman abolitionist worker has been caught–think it's Miss
                    Webster." She merely remarks that little did they know that the little woman who was then
                    passing them was the cause of all their <pb n="280" id="VAA4025-017-3-070"/> flurry, and how
                    surprised they would have been had they known the fact.</p>
            <p>Fairbank fared no better under the regime of Zebulon Ward, in fact he fared much worse. When Ward
                    came to the prison his inaugural address was short and showed fully his determination. He said:
                    "I'll not allow you to break me up. I came here to make money, and I'm
                    going to do it if I kill you all." He increased the allotment per man, making it a rule to
                    flog every one who failed to make his quota. Fairbank was then weaving flax and usually failed to
                    make his two hundred fifty yards per day, though working at top speed all the time. The flogging was
                    done by two whiskied overseers, Jack Page and Sam Thompson, two monsters in human form, who took
                    turn about at the work, one getting his wind while the other flogged. These floggings took place
                    during the noon hours and in the evenings. The whipping was inflicted upon the naked person, the
                    victim leaning forward over a stool, chair or bench, where he received stripes that cut his back
                    into pieces and made the blood flow freely. This cruelty took place under the administration of
                    Ward. During the later period of his incarceration, Fairbank was treated more humanely, and was
                    seldom ever whipped, though at one time he was dealt a blow on the head with a stick of stove wood
                    which almost cost him his life, and which always bothered his equilibrium during his remaining days.</p>
            <p>At length after twelve years of such horrible imprisonment in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> state prison, Fairbank was pardoned by Lieutenant Governor Jacobs, who restored him to
                    his liberty without anything in this world, excepting a few faithful friends and the scars of
                    affliction borne to his last day, the reward for the cause of a downtrodden race. But
                    Fairbank's work of liberating the slaves from their masters was over. When he again
                    breathed the air of freedom, the great Civil War was at its height, testing whether the union should
                    be preserved and slavery be overthrown. There is probably not recorded on the pages of our history
                    the story of another individual in our country, who suffered more for the cause of universal human
                    liberty than Calvin Fairbank. He suffered long and endured much to attain the object of his youthful
                    vow and indignation. Many another individual would have given up <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-017-3-071"/> hope and died under the lash, and such might have been the hard fate of Fairbank, but for the
                    helping hand of steadfast friends who sent him money and clothing and what was worth more than all,
                    words of good cheer, to help him bear up under the terrible strain.</p>

            <p>Miss Delia A. Webster was another of the anti-slave agents whose ostensible occupation was that of
                    teaching school. She was located at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>,
                            <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, while at her chosen profession
                    of teaching. To all appearances she was sincerely devoted to her profession. However, she never
                    permitted an opportunity to go by to aid a slave in securing his freedom. She was a New Englander by
                    birth, having been born in the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> and came west for the purpose of teaching. She hated slavery and did everything in her
                    power to alleviate the misery of those in bondage and to harass the slaveholders of northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. She was constantly engaged in the work of abducting slaves, though it was never proven
                    at any time that she was so engaged, and of course she made no admission of the fact. She came to be
                    hated by the slave masters as well as feared by them. While nothing could be established against
                    her, she was constantly under suspicion and was subjected to threats intermingled with much
                    persecution. With all this opposition, she continued her work just the same, traveling from one
                    locality to another, always coming in contact with slaves and teaching them the avenues of escape
                    and very frequently aiding them directly in the work herself. The scenes of her operations were all
                    along the southern border of Indiana, but chiefly south of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
               </placeName> and
                    Rising Sun. How many slaves she succeeded in liberating is, of course, not known, but she was
                    constantly at the work of persuading them to run away. Northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> suffered greatly from her effective work.</p>
            <p>It will be recalled that she worked a great deal of the time in conjunction with Calvin Fairbank.
                    Knowing him and working with him as his ally, she was not unacquainted with the principal conductors
                    and agents in Indiana and was thoroughly acquainted with the different underground routes northward
                    across our state to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>. She traveled constantly <pb n="282" id="VAA4025-017-3-072"/> along our southern
                    border, while not engaged in teaching a short term of school. There can be no doubt of the fact that
                    she was furnished financial aid in her work, by the abolitionists in Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, otherwise she would not have been able to accomplish so successfully what she
                    achieved. Besides acting as an abductor and agent, she was also a spy and much information was
                    gleaned by the underground operators from her. She was fearless in her actions and lived among the
                    slaveholders and catchers without being embarrassed by their braggadocia talk. She aided Fairbank in
                    getting the Hayden family across the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> onto free soil. Upon their
                    return to the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. No evidence was produced at the trial to condemn them, and if ordinary justice had
                    prevailed, they would have received a verdict of not guilty. But they were in the land of the
                    slaveholder whose ire against abolition agents exceeded justice and equity by several degrees. They
                    employed Sam Shy and Leslie Coombs as their attorneys. Three indictments were found against them
                    which would have been sufficient to imprison them for forty or fifty years. Each case was tried
                    separately, Miss Webster's being tried first. Miss Webster's father, Benaiah
                    Webster, came from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> and every influence possible was brought into requisition to secure an acquittal for
                    her, but nothing could stem the tide of prejudice against her, and she was condemned to imprisonment
                    for two years in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> penitentiary for aiding and abducting slaves. She arrived at the prison while Newton B.
                    Craig was warden. It was through his influence that she was pardoned by Governor Crittenden, after
                    just six weeks' imprisonment.</p>
            <p>Miss Webster seems to have been possessed of some of the alluring wiles of a Delilah and these she
                    skilfully plied with complete success upon old man Craig, the keeper of the prison. Having gained
                    her freedom from the governor, Craig seems to have been lost to her attention and confidence
                    forever. Her cunning scheme had borne its fruit and Craig was left to reflect upon how he had been
                    played as a pawn in the wily hand of the artful player. He bitterly repented of his action, when it
                    was too late, and afterwards remorselessly pursued her in seeking revenge for being tricked.</p>

            <p>After being freed from prison, Miss Webster traveled about doing her work in her usual successful
                    manner. When Fairbank was arrested and kidnapped into <placeName>

                    </placeName> from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, as a result of aiding Shotwell's slave, Tamar, to freedom in 1851,
                    one of the papers, the <hi rend="i">Herald</hi> at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Georgetown</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, noticing
                    his arrest, asked: "Whar is Miss Delia Webster? as they hunted in couples, she ought to be
                    somewhar in this vicinity." The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Daily Banner</hi> in reply, remarked that Miss Delia Webster arrived at that place
                    yesterday morning on the mail boat General Pike. Where she was from, where she was going and what
                    was her business west at that particular time had not yet been made public. These comments indicate
                    that the southerners were watching Miss Webster's every movement with the eye of a hawk.
                    They seemed to have been foiled in their detective work a great part of the time, for while they
                    were watching her closely at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, she was busy at her work near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At several other times some other woman was taken for her. When Mrs. Haviland was
                    visiting Fairbank in prison, she created quite a furore of excitement, because many southerners
                    thought that she was Miss Webster, and they cross-examined her very closely to make sure that she
                    was not the active confederate of Fairbank. The jailor even asked observers to go with them into the
                    prison, so that her actions might be closely scrutinized, while in the presence of the prisoner. The
                    newspapers, acting as the exponent of public feeling, said that Miss Webster was again in their
                    presence visiting Fairbank, and they were busy breathing out their threat-enings, all of which
                    showed how they hated and feared her.</p>
            <p>After her pardon from prison, Miss Webster bought a large farm in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Trimble county</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>,
                    which was located across the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Here she repaired to live, but no sooner was it made known what she had done
                    than the Kentuckians began their work of annoying her. They sent her word that she had better leave
                    the state to save her life, that they intended to burn her buildings and destroy her crops. They
                    felt that she was not to be tolerated in their presence, since the suspicion of her real work was
                    always uppermost in their minds, especially since the arrest of Rev. Norris Day, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, who was alleged to be her <pb n="284" id="VAA4025-017-3-074"/> partner in the
                    business and who made her home in <placeName>

                    </placeName> the scenes of his maneuvers. They accused her of the loss of quite a great amount of
                    their slave property and now to have her continue to live in their midst where she would furnish
                    slaves an asylum and her place act as a center of operations for abolitionists upon their cherished
                    institution, was more than they could tolerate. They were not going to permit her to live there. But
                    all their threats and bluff could not deter Miss Webster in the least. Noticing that she did not
                    seem to be perturbed by their orders and threats, they concluded to try legal action, when they
                    probably could have her convicted and imprisoned. She was arrested and jailed by the Kentuckians.
                    While in jail she was treated harshly and with but little or no respect. Later she managed to escape
                    from jail and arrived safely in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but the southerners were as relentless in their pursuit of her as they ever were after
                    a fugitive slave. They hatched up the charge of violating the law in abducting slaves, but fearing
                    that charge might fail against her, they brought forward and redocketed the three old indictments
                    against her in 1844, which were then ten years old and upon one point of which she had been
                    convicted and imprisoned before. The governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> made requisition upon the governor of Indiana for her extradition which was granted. At
                    this point we have the contest between the abolitionists on the one hand and the officers of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> on the other. Fortunately, we have the words of Miss Webster herself regarding her
                    experience during this time. She writes:</p>
            <p>"The Indianians, indignant at such an outrage upon a peaceable citizen, hid me from my
                    pursuers. Sometimes, they secreted me in the city and sometimes in the country–in haymow,
                    in the woods, under brush heaps, in rye fields, in cleft of rocks–sometimes in one place
                    and sometimes in another, until I was too feeble to be longer moved about.</p>
            <p>While I was prostate with sickness after some twelve days search, the officers got track of me, took
                    me off from the bed, put me in an open buggy and drove me fifteen miles under a scorching July sun,
                    and after dark made a daring attempt to smuggle me across the river. Here again they were defeated
                    and took me secretly to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where they confined me in jail, to await the arrival of the <placeName>

            <pb n="285" id="VAA4025-017-3-075"/>
            <p>The vigilant Indianians determined I should have the benefit of a <hi rend="i">habeas corpus</hi> and
                    a large troop of volunteers stationed themselves around the jail to prevent my being kidnapped by
                    the Kentuckians, and there I lay in close jail twenty days before I was able to be taken out for
                    trial. The evening prior to the trial, another requisition arrived demanding me upon another
                    ten-year-old indictment."<hi rend="sup">77</hi>

                    She was tried on both warrants and on the evening of the twenty-first of July, 1854, she was
                    discharged from custody by the decision of Judge Walker.</p>
            <p>Old man Craig was, of course, the chief prosecuting witness. He had every reason to wish vengeance.
                    He had been made the dupe of Miss Webster to get herself out of the penitentiary. He had also
                    written her some endearing letters after her freedom which she had permitted to be published about
                    the time he was up for re-election for warden before the <placeName>

                            he insisted upon "seeing the girl once more." In this prosecution he
                            appears before the public as a weak debauchee, whose honesty is entirely worn out like a

            <p>Early in the year 1857 a negro man by the name of Charles ran away from his master, Dr. H. Ditto, who

                    </placeName>, this state.<hi rend="sup">80</hi> Charles was a very valuable slave because he was a
                    blacksmith of excellence and consequently was worth more than the ordinary common run of slaves. His
                    master, upon discovering that he had headed toward freedom, immediately dispatched handbills and
                    runners in the direction of Brownstown in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson county</region>
                    </placeName>, with the intention of heading him off and again securing him as his property. Bills
                    were liberally distributed for his apprehension through Indiana and especially around Brownstown,
                    since it was generally known that it was here that the Underground Railroad made good connection
                    with the railroad north. It was thought that Charles would take this route. Newspaper notices and
                    hand bills had not been out so very long before they began to bear fruit. Early in October, 1857,
                    Mr. C. B. Johnston and a certain Mrs. Withers, both residing at <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, wrote letters to Dr. Ditto telling him that they could supply him with the
                    names of persons who had aided in the escape of his slave. Dr. Ditto soon got into <list type="footnotes">

                    were made known. Mrs. Withers said that a free negro by the name of Oswald Wright, who resided in
                    Corydon, Indiana, had come to her house and made inquiry about breakfast for himself and the runaway
                    slave, Charles. Wright said that he had left the fugitive at the depot and that he would bring him
                    to her house provided both could secure their breakfast. This was agreed to by Mrs. Withers. After
                    eating their morning repast, Wright took the fugitive to the train and saw him off on his trip to
                    freedom. While at her house Wright had made known the fact that a family by the name of Bell, who
                    lived on the Indiana shore opposite the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brandenburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> had aided in the escape of the negro and that they contemplated to effect the escape of
                    the wife of the fugitive whose name was Mary Ann and who was also in the possession of Dr. Ditto. C.
                    B. Johnson said that he had seen the reward offered in the newspaper and had become interested in
                    securing it, since it was an unusually liberal one. He began immediately to search for further
                    evidence, plying this business with that of horse trading. He had visited Corydon where he had made
                    it a business to see Wright, who had told him that he had aided in the escape of Charles and that he
                    had brought him from the Bell farm to Brownstown where the negro had taken the railroad. Wright
                    stated further that Charles Bell had told all about how he had stolen the fugitive away from Ditto
                    at Brandenberg, ferried him over the river and had harbored him until he could be sent northward. He
                    also said that Wright had asserted that he had loaned the fugitive his free papers to aid him if any
                    one should question his right to freedom and that he had conveyed the runaway Charles to Browns-town
                    on horse back. Having ascertained that the escape of Mary Ann was being planned, Johnston saw his
                    opportunity to find out more about the Bells as underground railroad agents. He went to their
                    neighborhood under the guise of a horse trader. He came to the Bell farm where he and his companions
                    put up their horses and crossed over to Brandenberg. where with the aid of the slave holders a plan
                    was hatched to catch the Bells. Johnston said that he and his <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson county</region>
                    </placeName> confederates saw Charles Bell and agreed upon a plan for the escape of Mary Ann. The
                    night was set and the Jackson <pb n="289" id="VAA4025-017-3-079"/> county men were to bring the
                    negro woman to the river at a place agreed upon and at the signal of the striking of a match Bell
                    was to cross over with a skiff and ferry her over. The negro Wright was to be at the Bell home to
                    receive her and put her through to Brownstown. Upon the night set, at about 10 or 11
                    o'clock the matches were struck at the point agreed upon and although it was a very dark,
                    rainy and windy night, in a few minutes of an hour, Charles Bell made his way to this signal on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> side. It was so dark that he was neither seen nor heard until he spoke and inquired,
                    "Where is she?" The Hoosier who had given the signal replied thai; she was in an
                    old mill upon the bank. Charles got out of the skiff and started to the mill to escort the colored
                    lady to the skiff. On the way to the mill he passed within a hollow square of gentlemen who seized
                    and placed him in jail. The skiff oars were muffled or wrapped with rags so as to prevent any noise
                    in rowing.</p>
            <p>The Kentuckians next crossed the river to secure the persons of Oswald Wright, the free colored man,
                    and old Mr. Bell, the father of Charles Bell. David Bell's house stood back from the river
                    a short way above high water mark. It was surrounded by some eight or ten men to prevent any one
                    from escaping. Two men went to the door and knocked and were told to come in. When they entered they
                    found the negro Wright in his sock feet, hoisted against the stove and old man Bell was reading a
                    newspaper. One of the men told Bell that they had come for his guest. They turned to Wright, told
                    him to put on his shoes and go with them, which was not readily agreed to, but with some
                    demonstration of the force they intended to use Wright accompanied them to the ferry boat at the
                    landing. They also took the two horses that Wright was to use to carry the woman off on. So far
                    nothing had been said to old man Bell. A little later two or three of the men returned to the house
                    and told Bell that they had taken the negro's horses and that he had better go with them to
                    see if they had any of his property. This Mr. Bell did. Instead of going to the barn they took him
                    to the ferry boat, where one of the company put his arms about him while a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> constable read a warrant accusing Bell of complicity in stealing a negro named Charles,
                    belonging to Dr. Ditto and commanded <pb n="290" id="VAA4025-017-3-080"/> that he be brought before
                    the magistrate in Brandenberg. The work of the constable was supposed to be legal because <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> claimed jurisdiction over the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> to low water mark on the
                    Indiana side. Wright and the Bells were now incarcerated in the Brandenberg jail.</p>
            <p>The preliminary trial was held before the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> magistrate the next day. The main prosecuting witnesses were the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson county</region>
                    </placeName> people. At the trial the witnesses swore that the negro Wright confessed that he had
                    received Ditto's negro at the house of old man Bell and had run him through to Brownstown
                    and that he had been notified by old man Bell when to come to his house with his horses. David Bell,
                    they said, confessed that he had notified Wright to be at his house on a certain night to receive
                    the slave and that he had furnished him with a pistol and a pocket compass, which he had purchased
                    at Corydon to aid him in his get away. They said that Charles Bell had confessed that he had crossed
                    to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> side to notify the negro when to be in readiness and on the day before the night of his
                    escape he was at a shop where he told the slave that Wright was at his father's with horses
                    and to be ready early that night. These confessions of David Bell and his son Charles were made, so
                    they said, while they were planning the escape of Mary Ann. Such was the evidence turned against the
                    Bells at their first hearing.</p>
            <p>Charles and his father were each placed under $5,000 bonds and the negro, Wright, under a
                    bond of $3,000. Bail was not forthcoming and they were all placed in jail. Here they
                    remained until the May term of court. The grand jury was busy in the interim and they were all
                    indicted on six points: (a) For enticing Charles to leave his master; (b) for stealing Charles from
                    his rightful owner; (c) for conspiring to run off a slave named Charles; and (d) for furnishing
                    Charles with forged and false papers. The other two points pertained to enticing a female slave
                    named Mary Ann to leave her owner and with conspiring to run off a female slave named Mary Ann.<hi rend="sup">81</hi>

                    raised a large force of armed men with the intention of forcibly releasing the prisoners from the <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Meade county</region>
                    </placeName> rangers. Soon the governor of <placeName>

                    </placeName> ordered a company of state militia to the border to prevent trouble. These troops were
                    commanded by Capt. JacK Armstrong. It truly seemed as if there might be petty border warfare between
                    the two states if only the proper spark were set to the powder. Fortunately nothing was done by the
                    Hoosiers and in a short time the guard grew too strong for a rescue. The Bells were permitted to
                    remain quietly in the Brandenberg jail to await their trial in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Meade county</region>
                    </placeName> circuit court whose term was to begin in May.</p>
            <p>The next scene in the drama appeared when Horace and John Bell, both sons of David Bell, returned
                    from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. They had heard of the way in which their father and brother had been landed in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Meade county</region>
                    </placeName> jail and had returned to their aid. Horace Bell was the oldest one of the sons, and
                    before going to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> had owned and operated the Brandenberg ferry, a popular crossing place from the
                    earliest times from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison county</region>
                    </placeName> to Brandenberg, over which the people in southern Indiana in this particular district
                    passed to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> town to do their trading. A road passed north from this ferry by way of Mauckport to
                    Corydon. Horace had followed his brother to the Golden State in the year 1851. John had been one of
                    the original '49ers. Horace seems to have been endowed with something of the Captain John
                    Smith disposition to see something of this world, so he later joined the Walker expedition of 1855
                    for the conquest of Nicaragua for the purpose of establishing the powers of the slavocracy there.
                    For this reason Horace was not considered an abolitionist in the southern sister state, but was
                    reckoned as one in sympathy with their favorite institution. Both of the boys had returned <pb n="292" id="VAA4025-017-3-082"/> to Indiana by way of the Panama route to <placeName>

                    time. While here they were approached by some of their old-time friends who wished to aid them in
                    rescuing their father and brother, but this they politely declined, saying that they would try fair
                    and just means. They crossed over to Brandenberg to secure bail for their imprisoned relatives and
                    finally found two slaveholders who agreed to go on the bonds. Their names were Alanson Mormon and
                    Arly Richardson. When they found that the bond for each was $5,000, they felt it was
                    impossible for them to do anything since it was excessive in amount. Father and son were, therefore,
                    left in prison.</p>
            <p>On the day of the trial in May many Indiana friends of the Bells passed over to Brandenberg to
                    witness it. People came down from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> and there were many from Corydon. The tragic manner of their arrest and the talk of
                    their rescue had kept up the enthusiasm of those who were mere onlookers and had filled those who
                    had been angered at the southern audacity with a grim determination to see that justice was done.
                    The Bells were defended by such lawyers as Judge Porter, Samuel Kean and Walter Q. Gresham, all from
                    Corydon. With such a company of legal lights it was evident that the Bells intended to fight the
                    case to a bitter end. Feeling ran high at the trial and in many instances did not fail to express
                    itself. The Bells were often jeered in the streets by the southerners. So exasperated did Horace
                    become at their attitude that at the adjournment of court one day he made them a short speech in
                    which he declared that he did not desire border warfare, that he had declined the aid of his armed
                    friends and neighbors, that all he desired was justice. If he did not get this he and his brother
                    would come alone, break the jail and set the prisoners free in broad daylight. This the southerners
                    took to be a big joke. They considered it as so much braggadocia. It was during the early days of
                    the trial that old Colonel Marsh was killed. He was a great friend of the Senior Bell and it was he
                    who had planned his rescue. He had come down from Corydon to hear the trial. He was standing near
                    the Brandenburg Hotel talking to two of his friends when he was shot by a man by the name of Stanley
                    Young, <pb n="293" id="VAA4025-017-3-083"/> who was secluded in the balcony of the hotel. It was
                    thought for a time that this affair was the result of hatred engendered by the Bell trial, but it
                    was later found out that it was the result of a family feud, since previous to this time Marsh had
                    killed Young's father.</p>
            <p>Delay was the game that was played by the southern officials. It was some time before preliminaries
                    were over and the real trial begun. When everything was in readiness the prosecution announced that
                    it was not ready for trial and-asked that the case be continued for six months. This was granted by
                    the court and the Bells had to stay in jail. From all appearances it seemed that they were to be
                    punished not by justice being meted out, but by the injustice of delay. They had already been in
                    jail almost a year and it seemed that they were doomed to more of it. This was more than the
                    impetuous Horace could stand, so bolder means were planned to free them.</p>
            <p>Their plan was to disappear apparently and await for the excitement to subside and the guards to be
                    lessened in number, when they would suddenly reappear and raid the jail. They talked the plan over
                    with their mother who thought that it was possible for it to terminate successfully. Their plan was
                    simple and direct. The two brothers were to cross over armed, surprise the jailor, free their father
                    and brother, arm them, hasten to the boat without firing a shot if they could, but to fight to the
                    last ditch if forced to do so.</p>
            <p>They set the date for freeing their father and brother on Thursday, July 29th. At that time there was
                    to be a barbecue at Garnettsville. Most of the people in Brandenberg would be out of town, for a
                    barbecue was always a great gatherer in that day. It also happened that the jailor himself was
                    absent on that day and there was no one in the jail except the wife of the jailor and a young man
                    who had been left to act as a guard. The outer guards had not yet returned to their duty from
                    dinner, since it was planned to make their move about noon or a little after when there would be a
                    lull in all activities. At the appointed time John and Horace, both armed with a belt of revolvers
                    and carrying a carpet bag containing ammunition and revolvers, came down to the landing where they
                    found their mulatto boy awaiting in his skiff ready to carry them <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-017-3-084"/> over. Crossing, each took a different street to the jail which stood about three hundred yards
                    back from the river bank. Arriving at the jail they both entered without trouble. Horace guarded the
                    jailor's wife and the young man while John went above, got the keys from a bureau and
                    liberated his father and brother. Both the liberated were given arms and hastened down stairs. In
                    the melee, the jailor's wife fainted because of fear and the young man disappeared through
                    a window of the jail to give the alarm. John hastened with his father and brother to the boat, while
                    Horace covered the retreat. Shots were fired as they gere getting into the boat, but they went
                    overhead. They were soon out a distance in the river when some of the Brandenbergers fired upon
                    them. The bullets struck in the water near the boat but did no damage. Horace stood up in the boat
                    and fired back at them with a big Derringer and his shots came so uncomfortably close that the
                    Kentuckians ceased to shoot and beat a hasty retreat.<hi rend="sup">82</hi> No one was hurt in the
                    exchange of shots and the Bells paddled their way across to the Indiana side of the river. The feat
                    of the brothers was heralded far and near by the papers and the whole river community jollified at
                    their exploits, much to the chagrin and mortification of the Brandenbergers. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> added its taunt by saying that the Bells were not only Bell-igerent but
                    likewise Bell-impudent. The same paper on August 10 printed quite a lengthy ballad about the affair.
                    The author, Forceythe Willson, wished to accord them a place among the heroes and to commemorate the
                    bold deed in rhyme. Two verses are quoted: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>It seemed that since the Bells were all safely lodged at home once more that that would be the end of
                    the contest, but such was not the case. There had been too much dancing for joy. The southern pride
                    had been stung and they must vent their wrath upon Horace Bell, if such was at all possible. They
                    only waited their time when the second scene of the drama should be played. They were already
                    secretly setting the stage in order, by offering a reward for the seizure and transportation of
                    Horace back to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> side. Something near $500 had been offered for his capture and in due time
                    this brought results.</p>

                    </placeName> fair was held during the week of October 19–23 in the year 1858. In that
                    particular period of our history it was well attended by the people of southern Indiana and northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. It was here that the second scene occurred on Saturday, October 23, the last day of
                    the fair. Old Mrs. Bell and her daughter had been at the fair that day and were going over to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to visit. Horace had accompanied them to the Duckwall ferry which operated between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>

                    chatting with a few of his friends. It was early in the afternoon and most of the people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> were out at the fair. But few people were about the streets, when Horace arrived at the
                    corner of Main and Bank streets preparatory to going by stage to Corydon that evening. At this place
                    he was surrounded by five men from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, all of whom were fully armed. They immediately disarmed Bell and hurried him to the
                    wharf, declaring to those whem they met in the streets that the one in their charge had committed a
                    foul murder on the other side of the river. As soon as he was landed on the ferry boat, it was
                    moving out into the river for the southern side. He was finally placed in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> jail, but during the night he was taken by a man by the name of Merrill to Brandenberg.

                    trouble.</p>
            <p>The whole city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> and surrounding country was filled with indignation at the outrage which had been
                    perpetrated upon a citizen of the commonwealth of Indiana. They immediately armed for his rescue. A
                    party of twenty-five men went to the court house at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> where they provided themselves with muskets, pistols, a swivel and ammunition. They
                    procured the ferry boat, Adelaide, and by the time it left its mooring on Monday evening, it had
                    seventy-five men on board. At Tobacco Landing in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison county</region>
                    </placeName> about four miles above Brandenberg they added about forty more. When they came within a
                    mile or two of Brandenberg about sixty men were landed who were to go overland and come down in the
                    rear of the city at the same time that the boat should come opposite. Of those that went overland,
                    all got lost but eighteen. Strangers to the roads and in a pitch black night they could not make
                    their way successfully. In the morning the squad of eighteen made a descent upon the jail but found
                    that Bell was not there. The jailor had been apprised of what was going to happen; so he had removed
                    Bell to the interior of the state to vicinity of Big Springs and Elizabethtown. The citizens of
                    Brandenberg, especially the merchants were conciliatory, because they feared that the armed men
                    might resort to incendiarism. A town meeting was therefore held to settle the affair. Judge
                    Alexander, William Fairleigh, Col. Moreman, Dr. Brown and Col. R. Buckner were appointed to act for
                    the Brandenbergers and John R. Cannon, George Austin and Oscar Gregg were the committee selected to
                    act for the invaders. The two committees agreed upon three points, first that the armed party should
                    return home, second that Bell was to be brought back to town and given an immediate examination and
                    if not discharged was to have a moderate sum assessed as bail, which bail was to be given by
                    Brandenberg citizens, and third that Governor Morehead was to be asked to pardon all the Bells. With
                    this agreement the army of invasion returned home and Bell was returned to Brandenberg for trial
                    which was held on Wednesday, October 27, before two justices of the peace. Bell was charged with
                    breaking jail and freeing his father and brother.</p>
            <pb n="297" id="VAA4025-017-3-087"/>
            <p>He pleaded guilty as charged and was admitted to a bail of $750 to appear before the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Meade county</region>
                    </placeName> circuit court in November. Messrs. Alanson Morman and J. M. Phillips of Brandenberg and
                    John R. Cannon of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> were his sureties. Bell came to his old home where he stayed for a short time and then
                    returned to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> and the bond which had been given for his sake was forfeited. The bondsmen were later
                    released from the payment of the bond by the executive branch of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> state government. So the curtain drops and closes one of the most exciting events that
                    ever occurred on our border over the subject of slavery.</p>
            <p>Before leaving the subject it should be said that Oswald Wright, the free negro, who figured in the
                    case was later convicted for stealing slaves and was sentenced to five years in the state
                    penitentiary at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Frankfort</settlement>
                    </placeName>. After serving out his term he returned to Corydon where he afterwards lived until his
                    death.</p>
            <p>In regard to David Bell, it is generally thought that he had been imprisoned for something that he
                    was entirely innocent of. His neighbors never felt that he had anything to do with either harboring
                    or running off slaves. He knew nothing about Charles nor Mary Ann, the two slaves. He was a man of
                    seventy years of age and a man of that age would not be a very effective underground agent. A
                    different story can be told with some degree of reliability about Charles Bell. He planned and
                    executed the escape of Dr. Ditto's slave Charles. He had come to hate the institution of
                    slavery because of the teaching of his Aunt Julia, who was bitterly opposed to slavery. Charles was
                    surely one of the anti-slave agents that worked on the border. He did not get the reputation that
                    was gained by Calvin Fairbank and Delia Webster, but no one can doubt the effectiveness of his work
                    which was done quietly and secretly.</p>

                    </placeName> springs, where a brief talk was made by Mr. de la Hunt, announcing the plan of donating
                    the old spring and the grounds surrounding it to the state of Indiana as a memorial to the

            <p>The party was then taken to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Odell at Sunny Crest, three miles up the

            <p>The centennial anniversary of the organization of the Little Flock Baptist church, located five miles

                        <region type="county">Sullivan</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, was celebrated with an all-day service and basket dinner, May 29. Thousands
                    of people attended, some coming from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who is eighty years of age, preached a sermon.</p>
            <p>The founders of the church were Tyre Harris, Susannah Harris, John Hodges, Polly Morgan, Mary Hill,
                    Elizabeth Anderson, Robert Anderson, Betsy Morgan, Sarah Eldridge, and Patience Cummins. The
                    meetings of the church were held first in a log school house which stood in the southeast corner of
                    the cemetery. A log church was built in 1826. In 1856 a frame building was erected, and in 1871, the
                    present building was constructed. All of the church records have been preserved. They show that more
                    than a thousand persons have been members of the church, and that from 1827 to the present the
                    church has had thirty ministers.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Literary Digest</hi> of April 30, 1921, gives an account of the inventor of the
                    first motion picture machine and his first show. The inventor was C. Francis Jenkins of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and he held his first show in that city in a jewelry store in 1894. At that
                    time, Mr. Jenkins was a clerk in the treasury department at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and had gone to his home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> for his vacation. He was unable to make a commercial success of his invention and it is
                    said that he sold his interest in it for $2,500. The machine which projected the picture
                    is on exhibition at the national museum in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and is said to be the forerunner of all present-day projectors.</p>
            <p>It is planned to place a bronze tablet on the jewelry store in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, indicating that the first motion picture machine gave an exhibition in that store June
                    6, 1894.</p>
            <p>Mr. Jenkins is still living in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and recently invented the Discrola, a machine that will reproduce motion <pb n="300" id="VAA4025-017-3-090"/> pictures from a disc similar to that used on a phonograph. It is
                    expected this machine can be used in the home like the phonograph.</p>
            <p>The conspicuous role which the Quakers have played in the development of Indiana was commemorated at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, August 15, 1921, by a centennial celebration of the establishment of their
                    first Yearly meeting in the state, which was organized in 1821. A forenoon program consisting of
                    greetings from other Yearly meetings, an address by Harlow Lindley, of Earlham college, on
                    "A Century of Quakerism in Indiana", and an address by Rufus M. Jones, of
                    Haverford college, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, on "Quakerism of the Future" was carried out, and in the afternoon a
                    pageant was presented depicting the principal activities in which Friends have been directly
                    concerned. Since about one-third of the Quakers in America live in Indiana, and the members of this
                    church have taken a prominent part in the political, religious, educational, business, and moral
                    development of the Hoosier state, this celebration carries with it an unusual interest. It is
                    planned to publish a history giving a full account of Quakerism in the state as part of the
                    year's activities.</p>
            <p>Indiana's list of authors has an addition in Richard Otto Johnson, A.M., late superintendent
                    of the Indiana state school for the deaf. As chairman of a committee appointed for the purpose by
                    the Conference of Superintendents and Principals of American Schools for the Deaf, Mr. Johnson has
                    prepared a report of 260 pages on "Standardization, Efficiency and Heredity" in
                    the education of the deaf, which is already received by educators as a standard in a comparatively
                    unoccupied field. It not only presents a full and scientific explanation of the causes of deafness,
                    and a discussion of practical education of the deaf, but also gives ideas for teaching that can be
                    profitably considered by all teachers.</p>
            <p>The book is evidently worthy of the flattering letters and press notices it is calling forth, and is
                    a notable addition to Indiana's scientific literary product. Mr. Johnson has long been
                    known as a contributor to educational periodicals, but this is his first venture in book form.</p>

            <p>George R. Wilson, who has contributed many historical articles of great value to Indiana history, has
                    recently brought forth an interesting life of George H. Proffit, one of the famous men of Indiana
                    during the period of the thirties and forties. Few men in southwestern Indiana played a more
                    prominent part in Indiana history during the decade from about 1836–46 than did George H.
                    Proffit. As a member of the state legislature, a representative in congress, as political advisor to

                    </placeName>, before they were discovered to be enemy forces. Mr. Minor, who was then a lad in his

                    pistol to provide a saddle for the invading captain was responsible for sending forth the
                    information that the forces were from the Confederate States, and thereby enabled the forces of the
                    state government to <pb n="302" id="VAA4025-017-3-092"/> assemble a sufficient guard to drive the

            <p>The celebration of the 100th anniversary of the establishment of churches and schools in Indiana
                    calls for more than passing notice in an historical magazine. One of the famous old churches of <placeName>

                    erected in August, 1821, was of hewn logs, the building was thirty by forty feet, and the funds were

            <p>Every few days the attention of the public is called to the great loss that Indiana is suffering by

                    <hi rend="i">News</hi> of May 14, 1921, carried an interesting article from Jacob P. Dunn reciting
                    the career of Gen. <pb n="304" id="VAA4025-017-3-094"/> Henry D. Washburn, soldier-explorer, and a
                    noted figure in our national history. It was under General Washburn's command that the
                    first official exploration of the headwaters of the Yellowstone was made in the summer of 1870. With
                    a military escort of a half dozen men, he succeeded in reaching the headwaters in September, and
                    after making a thorough investigation submitted the reports to congress. General Washburn was
                    instrumental in arousing interest that later led to congressional action in making the land about
                    the Yellowstone a National park. General Washburn did not live to see his ambition realized, since
                    he died January 26, 1871, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Clinton</settlement>

            <p>Miss Charity Dye, well known educator, teacher, and student of Indiana history, died July 21, 1921,

               </placeName>, October, 1849, she moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1873. She immediately identified herself with educational, social, civic, and club
                    life of the city, and became a real leader in the affairs of the city. As a teacher and student of
                    Indiana history, a writer of pageants and a lecturer for the cause of women's rights, she
                    became a recognized state leader. As a member of the Indiana Historical commission she devoted her
                    time and services unstintingly during the state's centennial in 1916, and did much to
                    arouse an interest in the study and appreciation of pioneer history. She conceived the idea of
                    establishing a monument in memory of the pioneer mothers of Indiana, a task to which she devoted all
                    of her strength during the last days of her life.</p>
            <p>The Historical commission announces the completion of the Gold Star Volume, the first of the State
                    War History series. The volume contains the names, photographs, and a brief biographical sketch of
                    the 3,354 men and 15 nurses from Indiana who lost their lives while in service during the World war.
                    The book comprises 750 pages, is handsomely bound in imitation leather with the letters GOLD STAR
                    HONOR ROLL set on a raised dye, and in gold leaf. One copy of the volume <pb n="305" id="VAA4025-017-3-095"/> has been awarded, as a gift of the state, to every family in the state
                    who lost a son or daughter while in service. Also one copy has been placed in each of the public
                    libraries, and in the college and normal school libraries in the state.</p>

            <p>Doubting the statement, I learned the source of authority, and on inquiry there, was informed that

                    that she "had met a lady of that name"; and the location was not

                    do not know of any Hoosiers in this part of the country. The majority of the Hausers pronounce their
                    name Hooser; a few pronounce it Howzer. The correct spelling is Hauser." This is the second

               <geogName>Whitewater valley</geogName> was selected for the annual pilgrimage in June, of the Society
                    of Indiana pioneers, with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName> as the starting point, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> as the objective. The pilgrimage was planned by William H. Insley of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and was one of the most successful yet taken by the society from the viewpoint of
                    historic interest and scenic beauty. At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName> the pioneers were met at the station by members of the Rotary club, whose guests they
                    were to be. The Rota-rians had planned a motorcade through the streets and along the old Indian
                    trails leading out of the city. Each member of the party was supplied with a pamphlet <hi rend="i">Historic Connersville</hi> written by J. L. Heineman, and each car contained a man or woman who
                    knew the past history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName> as well as the story of its modern progress. Historic points of interest were marked by
                    placards and passed in quick succession. One of the interesting features was the drive along the
                    White water canal. Numerous bridges mark its course through the city, and at one place a spillway
                    added a musical note to the quiet stillness of the onward flowing waters. The site of the barge
                    basin suggested scenes of great activity in the early history of the canal, and the home of Capt.
                    Gayle Ford recalled a moment of great historical interest when under his guidance the first boat
                    "The Patriot" arrived at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1845. Through the courtesy of Misses Cresler and Sumner the pioneers were
                    entertained evening and night at Elmhurst college. Dinner was served in the small but artistic
                    dining-room of the historic mansion, after which the pioneers assembled on the spacious lawn to
                    enjoy the program which had been prepared. Speeches were made by E. P. Hawkins, and J. L. Heineman,
                    who spoke on the history of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette county</region>

                    </placeName>, representing the pioneers. A sketch of the life of John Conner was read by a
                    great-granddaughter, Mrs. C. V. Thompson of <placeName>

                    mystery, and made it indeed Elmhurst, the Beautiful. Leaving Elmhurst the next morning, the
                    motorcade wended its way toward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> over the old <placeName>

                    Shirk, was thrown open to the pioneers during their stay in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Historic points of interest, too numerous to mention in detail, were visited both
                    morning and afternoon. Two historic churches were visited– Big Cedar church, the history
                    of which was given by J. C. Shirk, and Little Cedar church, organized in 1806 and erected in 1812,
                    the story of which was told by Harry M. Stoops. A dinner was served at the Methodist Episcopal
                    church by the Ladies' aid society, and another program given, consisting of speeches, music
                    and song. A visit to the Hermitage, the home of J. Otis Adams, one of Indiana's well known
                    artists, and the privilege of visiting his exhibit of paintings, was one of the pleasures of the
                    day. It was here that the pioneers began to say good-bye and started on the return journey, some
                    returning to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> by motor, while others returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and again had the privilege of being entertained at Elmhurst.</p>
            <p>Forty years ago in August, 1881, an attempt was made to organize a <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Versailles</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The pioneer meeting was in charge of George W. Lane of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn county</region>
                    </placeName>, and Governor S. S. Harding, territorial governor of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. This attempt failed because of lack of interest. A <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Ripley county</region>
                    </placeName> paper speaks of that failure as "greatly to be regretted that they did not

                    </placeName> was written in the memories of these men."</p>
            <p>July 14, this year, another attempt was made to organize a local historical society which promises to
                    be more successful than the first. Invitations were sent to all those who were thought to be
                    interested in the preservation of local history.</p>

                    </placeName>, many of them descendants of the early settlers, and perfected an organization. Joseph

                    accomplished by a wide-awake citizenship which takes as its motto "It Can Be
                    Done."</p>

                        <region type="county">Cass counties</region>
                    </placeName> united in making an historical survey of the old Indian trails and points of interest
                    along the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie canal from Delphi to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The survey was planned by Ben F. Stuart of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Carroll county</region>
                    </placeName>, assisted by J. C. Odell, the newspapers of both counties, and the chamber of commerce
                    at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The survey began at the courthouse in Delphi, J. C. Odell giving the history of the
                    places visited between Delphi and Carrolton. At the Carrolton bridge Hoover Jones told how the canal
                    boats crossed the river at this point in the days of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie canal. The historian from Carrolton to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Georgetown</settlement>
                    </placeName> was Ben F. Stuart. At noon the party gathered at the site of the old trading post near
                    Lockport where a basket dinner was served. When the county line was reached between <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Carroll</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Cass counties</region>
                    </placeName>, Rufus Magee of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> became the historian <pb n="309" id="VAA4025-017-3-099"/> for <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Cass county</region>
                    </placeName>, and the party drove toward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> along the beautiful river road. Many places of historic interest were visited, for
                    which this county is famous, among them the home of Judge Biddle at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The country club entertained the party at its home near the city, and at 6:30 a dinner
                    was served by the chamber of commerce. The program was in charge of the local historical society,
                    with William T. Wilson as chairman. Speeches were made by members of the chamber of commerce, the
                    local historical society, Harlow Lindley, secretary, Indiana Historical commission, and Mrs. Kate
                    Milner Rabb, author of <hi rend="i">A Tour Through Indiana, in 1840</hi> and the Hoosier Listening
                    Post. A musical program of old-time melodies, arranged by Caroline McNitt, added much to the
                    enjoyment of the evening. Much interest was aroused in the two counties by this survey, a noteworthy
                    result being shown in the series of articles published by the Delphi <hi rend="i">Citizen-Times</hi>. and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Pharos-Tribune</hi>. and the increase in membership in the State Historical
                society.</p>
