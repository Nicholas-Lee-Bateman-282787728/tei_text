					<lg>
						<l>The-Boy-I-Used-to-Be would know</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">How far it is to Christmas Day,</l>
						<l>And every night in dreams would go</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Swift-paced along the wondrous way;</l>
						<l>And he by day would count the weeks,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">The days-the very hours, indeed!--</l>
						<l>With eager eyes and flaming cheeks</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">The lore of Christmas he would read.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Ah, he knew all the jolly tales</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">The folk about the Day would weave;</l>
						<l>With boyish faith, which never fails,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">He had the knowledge to believe.</l>
						<l>He knew the legends all were true,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">He scrawled queer letters to the Saint,</l>
						<l>He heard the fairy horns that blew</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Their marvel-music, far and faint.</l>
					</lg>
					<pb id="VAA9483-019" n="9"/>
					<lg>
						<l>He heard beyond the northern lights</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">The pounding of the reindeer hoofs,</l>
						<l>And counted all the long, long nights</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Ere they should course above the roofs;</l>
						<l>And Christmas Eve he heard the song</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Of Santa Claus, while rapt he lay;</l>
						<l>Heard Santa's laughter, clear and strong,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">When he drove merrily away.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>O, all of this, and more, was his;</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">The magic of the Christmas time--</l>
						<l>But now what little magic is</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">In thinking of that silver chime,</l>
						<l>In thinking of the things I knew</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">So clearly in the long ago,</l>
						<l>And knew not that their being true</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Was quite the fairest thing to know!</l>

						<l>Of all the Christmas wishes made</l>

						<pb id="VAA9483-020" n="[10]"/>

					<lg>
						<l>Ho, little fellow, if you will be good</l>
						<l>Some day you may go to the Christmas-Tree Wood.</l>
						<l>It lies to the north of the Country of Dreams,</l>
						<l>It glitters and tinkles and sparkles and gleams;</l>
						<l>For tinsel and trinkets grow thick on the trees</l>
						<l>Where wonderful toys are for him who will seize.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>You go by the way of the Road of Be-Good</l>
						<l>Whenever you go to the Christmas-Tree Wood,</l>
						<l>And when you draw near you will notice the walls</l>
						<l>That rise high about the fair City of Dolls,</l>
						<l>Whose entrance, unless you are wanted, is barred</l>
						<l>By Tin-Soldier regiments standing on guard.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>It's over in Candy Land, there where the shops</l>
						<l>Forever are turning out peppermint drops;</l>
						<l>Where fences are built of the red-and-white sticks</l>
						<l>And houses are fashioned of chocolate bricks,</l>
						<pb id="VAA9483-022" n="[12]"/>
						<l>Where meadow and forest and sidewalk and street</l>
						<l>Are all of materials children can eat.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>You sail on a ship over Lemonade Lake</l>
						<l>And drink all the waves as they quiver and break,</l>
						<l>And then, when you land, you are under the trees</l>
						<l>Where Jumping Jacks jump in the sway of the breeze--</l>
						<l>But only the children most awfully good</l>
						<l>Can ever go into the Christmas-Tree Wood.</l>

					<lg>
						<l>The firelight flickers soft across the floor,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">And plays among the shadows here and there,</l>
						<l>As though it sought the lad who comes no more,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">To let it lay its gold upon his hair.</l>
						<l>And she-she sits alone here in the glow</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">And smoothes the empty stockings on her knee</l>
						<l>And sighs and smiles, and thinks of long ago,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">When jolly lights were dancing in the tree.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>The empty stockings! It is Christmas Eve,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">And distant songs come faintly from without,</l>
						<l>While blithest chimes take up the thread, and weave</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">A singing-fabric blent with boyish shout;</l>
						<l>But she has none of all the outer joy,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">She has shut in herself with all her grief,</l>
						<l>With all her fond remembrance of her boy,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">The stockings and a withered holly wreath.</l>
					</lg>
					<pb id="VAA9483-024" n="[14]"/>
					<lg>
						<l>She minds the times his rosy little feet</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Have faltered as they came across the room;</l>
						<l>She minds his laugh-no carol was more sweet;</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">The firelight creeps up to her from the gloom;</l>
						<l>The firelight seems to tire of all its play,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">And comes to rest about her while she broods,</l>
						<l>Save that some dancing flashes fain would stray</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Into the whisper-haunted solitudes.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>And so the fire burns low, the coals turn red,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">And die into a lifeless, flaking gray--</l>
						<l>Then out upon the midnight air is sped</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">The burst of sound saluting Christmas Day!</l>
						<l>Then she amid the chiming clamor hears</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">His voice! What other accent could it be?</l>
						<l>A smile of peace gleams sunlike through her tears--</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">She smoothes the empty stockings on her knee.</l>

					<lg>
						<l>Consider the man who showeth the way mechanical toys are worked;</l>
						<l>Who telleth with great exactness how the string should be tied and jerked;</l>
						<l>Who grabbeth the lop-eared elephant and bendeth the winding thing,</l>
						<l>Until he breaketh the trunk and tail and busteth the moving spring;</l>
						<l>Who taketh the engine and the train and starteth them on the track,</l>
						<l>And wrecketh the whole arrangement while he smileth in glee. Alack!</l>
						<l>My son, my son, consider the man, he flourisheth everywhere;</l>
						<l>He squeezeth the "ma-ma" from the doll and twisteth the growling bear;</l>
						<pb id="VAA9483-057" n="45"/>
						<l>He worketh the mimic theatre, and voweth that he doth know</l>
						<l>The manner in which it shall be done-- but endeth the little show;</l>
						<l>He choketh the "moo" in the muley-cow, the "baa" in the woolly sheep,</l>
						<l>He breaketh the eye of the jointed doll so that she may never sleep;</l>
						<l>He robbeth the lion of his rear, he crusheth the camel's hump;</l>
						<l>He spraineth the jumping-jack-- he doth-- he taketh from it the jump;</l>
						<l>He windeth the music-box too much and stoppeth its melody;</l>
						<l>He trieth to work the dancing-doll and breaketh its nimble knee.</l>
						<l>All this he doth and a whole lot more, and weareth his knowing grin,</l>
						<l>And reckoneth naught of the grief aroused because of his deeds of sin,</l>
						<pb id="VAA9483-058" n="46"/>
						<l>For always he showeth the way to work the new mechanical toy</l>
						<l>Before the thing hath ever been touched by any delighted boy.</l>
						<l>He telleth the children great and small to stand to the side and wait</l>
						<l>The while he showeth the proper way to get it to operate;</l>
						<l>If infantile minds are filled with the thought that they know the way to wind</l>
						<l>The horse or the sheep or the lion or bear, he stoppeth them, smiling and kind;</l>
						<l>He maketh them wait; he maketh them weep; he maketh them clamor and wail;</l>
						<l>He cracketh the face of the phonograph-doll and spoileth the tiger's tail,</l>
						<l>And all because he knoweth it all-the sum of all knowledge is his--</l>
						<l>My son, my son, take heed of the man, observe what a nuisance he is. </l>

						<l>His trembling fingers curved as if to clasp</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">The days that were so far and yet so near,</l>
						<l>The happy days that had escaped his grasp--</l>

						<l>And so, remembering, he wandered on</l>

						<l>When, just before the coming of the dawn,</l>

					<lg>
						<l>Ragged and grimy, with hungering eyes,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">They stand at the window of wonderful toys,</l>
						<l>And count all the marvels with whispering cries</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">That tell of the longing for glittering joys.</l>
						<l>Their fingers are twitching to touch and to hold</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">The baubles that show in the tempting display--</l>
						<l>And, knowing that even their wishes are bold,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">They have not the courage for turning away.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>And we, we look on with a chuckle and smile,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Or laugh at their boasting of what they would do</l>
						<l>If one of the toys could be theirs for a while--</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">The toys that are perfect and gorgeously new.</l>
						<l>We smile at their words and their gestures uncouth,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Their longings for what is held far from their reach--</l>
						<l>But under it all is a lesson of truth</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">That only the toys and the gamins could teach.</l>
					</lg>
					<pb id="VAA9483-088" n="72"/>
					<lg>
						<l>This life is a window through which we may see</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">The toys that we know would complete our delight--</l>
						<l>The toys to bring gladness to you and to me</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Are ever and always set fair in our sight.</l>
						<l>But we are held back by some mystical force</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">That bars us from reaching our fingers to touch</l>
						<l>The trinkets that would be the fairy-like source</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Of all of the glow that would gladden us much.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>And we stand and hunger for what is withheld,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">For fame and for fortune, for pleasure and pride;</l>
						<l>By barriers invisible are we repelled,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Through power unknown our vain hopes are denied.</l>
						<l>We children-- we children-- ay, each of us peers</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">At the prizes he thinks would be chief of his joys--</l>
						<l>We children we stand through the drift of the years</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">At the window of toys-- at the window of toys!</l>

						<l>My sawdust heart is broken, and my china eyes are sad--</l>
						<l>This night has been the darkest that I ever, ever had;</l>
						<l>The little girl who owns me used to tuck me in my bed</l>
						<l>And whisper that she loved me, while she covered up my head</l>
						<l>And told me to be careful not to kick the covers off,</l>
						<l>For fear I might be croupy, or should catch the whooping-cough.</l>
					</lg>

						<l>The little girl who owns me let me drop upon the floor,</l>

						<l>One year ago my fortune seemed to be serenely bright--</l>

						<l>She made me share her play with her, she tried to make me eat,</l>
						<l>She showed me to all callers-- and they vowed that I was sweet;</l>

						<pb id="VAA9483-114" n="96"/>
						<l>And we'd 'a' gone in early, and they'd 'a' tumbled down,</l>
						<l>And laughed an' waved their "hellos" to all they knew in town.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>The sky is gray and gloomy; the house is dark and still;</l>
						<l>The cedar-trees are lonesome where they stand on the hill--</l>
						<l>And we'd picked out the best one, the one we knew would be</l>
						<l>The very finest cedar to make a Christmas-tree.</l>
						<l>The clock here on the mantel is tickin' sad and slow;</l>
						<l>"They can't come home for Christmas, they're not a-comin'. No!"</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>And mother at the window looks out and down the lane,</l>
						<l>And I stare at my paper-- but stare at it in vain,</l>
						<pb id="VAA9483-115" n="[97]"/>
						<l>For all the type is tangled and all the letters blurred</l>
						<l>In one unendin' sentence, repeatin' word an' word--</l>
						<l>The only news the world holds to-day for her and me:</l>
						<l>"They can't come home for Christmas," is all that I can see.</l>

					<lg>
						<l>I see them all about me, the little things undone--</l>
						<l>The wagon that I promised to "fix so it would run,"</l>
						<l>The doll, the drum, the trumpet, are scattered here and there;</l>
						<l>I promised I would take them when I'd the time to spare.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>And he-- he was so patient; more so than I could be,</l>
						<l>Nor minded when I tumbled the trinkets from my knee,</l>
						<l>But went out softly singing, as do blithe little boys,</l>
						<l>To wondrous make-believing with all his broken toys.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>I call him in a whisper that trembles to a sigh;</l>
						<l>I call him in a whisper-- but wait for no reply;</l>
						<pb id="VAA9483-117" n="[99]"/>
						<l>And then as at an altar before the toys I bow,</l>
						<l>And touch with fumbling fingers-- I'm not too busy now!</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Ah, now my hands are idle; my heart is idle, too--</l>
						<l>It does not thrill in cadence with all the laughs I knew.</l>
						<l>I count the broken treasures he asked me to make whole,</l>
						<l>And count the niggard minutes I gave him as his dole.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>But I shall leave them broken, these toys that still are his,</l>
						<l>And he must hear my whisper in what fair place he is:</l>
						<l rend="i">"I wonder if in heaven they will not let me do</l>
						<l rend="i">The little things-- the little things I did not do for you!"</l>
					</lg>
