            <p>Indiana became a state at the very time the nation was divorcing itself from the European political
                    and economic systems and entering upon a career purely American in policy. The downfall of Napoleon
                    and the close of the War of 1812 had freed us from European chicanery. The energy and intellect of
                    the country were thence to be spent in developing the resources of the interior. The successful
                    termination of the war and the following "Era of Good Feeling" made the Republican
                    the popular party, while on the other hand the Federalist opposition to the war and especially the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hartford</settlement>
                    </placeName> Convention made that party and its leaders particularly unpopular. As a result party
                    lines disappeared and for more than a decade personal politics controlled the country both
                    nationally and locally. In this period all claimed to be Republicans; none would accept the name
                    Federalist. The elections were waged about the personality of men or upon local or passing
                        issues.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    high, resulting in the post offices being filled with unclaimed letters. There were two hundred such

                    conditions of travel as late as 1826 were described by a politician canvassing for votes in that

                    streams, use Indian guides, build canoes, sleep in woods with wolves howling, make one speech and

            <p>Until 1824 the people of the state voted directly for only one federal official, a congressman. In
                    1816 the Indiana presidential electors were chosen by the state legislature sitting at Corydon.
                    Again in 1820 the electors were chosen in the same manner, the people knowing nothing about it.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>In 1824 the state legislature provided for the election of electors by popular vote.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Along with this lack of direct participation in national affairs there was a very
                    deep-rooted patriotism of the extreme democratic type. This was most manifest in an almost insane
                    hatred of Federalists and everything connected therewith. The same things that had caused Jefferson
                    to call some of the Federalist leaders Anglo-men<hi rend="sup">9</hi> and had caused Monroe to brand
                    their actions as treason<hi rend="sup">10</hi> was sufficient to cause those western pioneers to
                    despise the name in any manner that it might be applied. In the first decade of the state's
                    history a Mr. John Allen was fined a thousand dollars in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> circuit court for calling Joshua Harlan a Federalist.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> In the
                    course of the trial the leading witness for the plaintiff swore that the common acceptance of the
                    term Federalist was, a Tory, an enemy of his country, and that he had never heard any other meaning;
                    that he would rather be called anything under the sun than a Federalist; and that he would feel just
                    as safe in the woods with an Indian and his tomahawk as with a Federalist. The lawyers in their
                    argument covered the field of American history, touching the administration of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the election of Jefferson, the contest between Jefferson and Burr, the case of Citizen
                    Genet, the Cunningham Correspondence,<hi rend="sup">l2</hi> Alien, Sedition and Gag laws,
                    impeachment of Judge Chase, the trial of Burr for treason and other kindred points. This hatred of
                    Federalists endured for more than a quarter of a century being used by the Democrats as a campaign
                    cry against the Whigs as late as 1840.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> These widely scattered, patriotic,
                    liberty loving frontiersmen furnished the most fruitful field for the development of a new American

            <p>The early settlers of Indiana were intensely Democratic in their political doctrines. As a result
                    office tenure under the constitution, was for short periods, thereby necessitating frequent
                    elections. The members of the state house of representatives were elected annually and held annual
                        sessions.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> The state senators were elected for terms of three yars,
                    one-third their number retiring each year. The governor and lieutenant governor served for terms of
                    three years. The sheriff and coroner were elected for terms of two years. Judges of the circuit
                    court served for seven years, and justices of the peace for five years, while township elections
                    were triennial. With congressional elections occurring every two years and national elections every
                    four years the citizen had the questions of politics constantly before him. This was all the more
                    true since the township elections occurred in the spring (first Monday in April), while the other
                    regular state elections were held on the first Monday in August.</p>
            <p>The methods were the most characteristic features of the politics of the day. In the absence of
                    organized parties and party machinery, candidates announced themselves for office through the
                    columns of the newspapers or by printed handbills which were distributed from house to house. In the
                    earlier years these announcements were generally very profuse in their praise of the candidate
                    though the exceptions were common.</p>

                    county. All other stories were merged into the grocery matter. The act was decidedly popular, as
                    drinking houses were odious. Mr. Craig was elected by a larger majority than ever before, although
                    he was not a temperance man.</p>
            <p>The ignorance of the people about the common national issues made their mention by candidates
                    extremely hazardous. O. H. Smith relates two very amusing incidents of the congressional campaign of
                    1826. Judge John Test was his competitor: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The judge was speaking in favor of the tariff. The people knew but little about it, but what
                            they had heard was decidedly against it. Few knew the meaning of the word and fewer what it
                            was like. One old fellow said that he had never seen one but he believed it was hard on
                                sheep.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>At another time in the same campaign the two candidates met at Allenville in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland county</region>
                    </placeName>. In the course of his speech Judge Test mentioned for the first time the new subject of
                    railroads. He told the crowd that cars were running at the rate of thirty miles an hour in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and would run even faster in America. This was too much for the crowd. It set up a loud
                    laugh at the expense of the Judge and one old fellow yelled at him: "You are crazy, or do
                    you think we are all fools? A man could not live a moment at that speed." The judge ruined
                    his chances in that county by telling such an improbable story.</p>
            <p>In the campaign of 1817 the most conspicuous figure was William Hendricks. In the election of 1816 he
                    had succeeded Jennings as territorial delegate, but with the formal recognition of statehood it
                    became necessary to elect a state representative to congress. Hendricks of course, was the choice of
                    the leaders who were in control. The opposition began its fight on him at the earliest possible

            <p>According to Hendricks' own letter, the most violent personal abuse was heaped upon him for
                    his conduct as a representative because first, he had procured the appointment of printer of <placeName>

                    </placeName> laws for the <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> in preference to the <hi rend="i">Herald</hi>;
                    second, he had attempted to have the printing of laws taken away from Elihu Stout, of the <hi rend="i">Western Sun and General Advertiser</hi>; third he had secured the appointment of
                    Armstrong Brandon, as postmaster at Corydon, when the resigning postmaster Mr. Heth had recommended
                    Mr. M'Bean as his successor. It was also charged in this case that neither Mr. Hendricks
                    nor Senator James Noble had consulted Senator Waller Taylor before making the appointment. The
                    Western Sun and General Advertiser complained that he had caused delay in the payment of the state
                    militia for national service. In accounting for the opposition Mr. Hendricks said: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    Throughout the center of the state the vote was fairly equally divided with the majorities generally
                    in favor of Hendricks. Hendricks received a total of 5075 votes to 3272 for Posey. In the
                    congressional election of 1818, Hendricks was opposed by Ruben A. Nelson. The victory was
                    overwhelming for Hendricks. Nelson carried only two counties, Warrick by a vote of 92 to 6 and Knox
                    by 343 to 179, while in many counties he did not receive more than one vote.84 In 1820 Nelson was

            <p>With Hendricks firmly intrenched in congress, political contention again centered about Jennings. His
                    every act was subject to adverse criticism. In 1818 he was appointed by the president, as a
                    commissioner along with Lewis Cass of Michigan and Benjamin Parke to treat with the Indians. They
                    succeeded in purchasing from the Indians all the central part of the state, and with the exception
                    of the Miami, the Thorn-town and a few other reservations, all the Indian land south of the

                    Christopher Harrison said of the affair: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I decided in my own mind that the Honorable Jonathan Jennings in consequence of his holding

            </p>
            <p>Harrison immediately took charge of the state seal which had been left with the secretary of state.
                    On the 24th of October he left Corydon and was away until the 30th. In the meantime Governor
                    Jennings had returned and had carried the state seal away from the secretary of state's
                    office, where it had been left by Harrison on a promise that no one but Harrison should have it.
                    Jennings refused to surrender the seal on the demand of Harrison. The contest was carried to the
                    legislature, which recognized Jennings' motives in serving as a commissioner, and failed to
                    oust him. Harrison immediately resigned. The constitutional right of an officer was often called
                    into question during this early period. In 1822 the <hi rend="i">Western Sun and General

                    almost every new settler was opposed to slavery, and Jennings had been the champion of antislavery

            <p>The work of the General Assembly was in just as chaotic condition as the politics of the state. For
                    the first five years the General Assembly consisted of a senate of ten and a house of twenty-nine.
                    There was very little general legislation, the, time being generally taken up with local matters,
                    most often a divorce bill or an impeachment of a justice of the peace. In one week the General
                    Assembly granted as many as five divorces.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> These were often granted without
                    regard to the merits of the case and most often as a result of log-rolling. Some who were opposed to
                    such bills objected but this objection had little force. Governor Jennings in his message to the
                    General Assembly in 1819 outlined a program of future legislation which was later to become the
                    basis of political contention in the state, but the population was yet too scattered to give a
                    united demand for any public policy. The points covered by the message were: <list type="ordered">

                    people—by districting the state; or second, by choosing them on a general ticket. Both
                    methods were in common usage.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> In the election of the state Assembly in 1823 the

            <p>The next week the candidates answered the questions of Beckes through the columns of the <hi rend="i">Sun.</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">6</hi> The candidates seemed to be of a harmonious opinion on all
                    subjects. In answer to the first, Johnston declared for Clay and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>, McCall for <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>, and Law for "a man of the West." All of them favored the repeal of
                    the poll tax, would support revision, favored the districting of the state, would never sell the
                    school lands, but rather lease them, and would have no convention (constitutional) at this time.
                    Johnston declared that the road law for 1818 was preferable while the others would be governed by
                    the will of their constituents. Johnston said his politics were and have always been Republican.
                    McCall said he was a decided Democrat, while Law was a Republican in principles and practice.
                    Law's answer to the fourth question was interesting owing to the fact that two weeks
                    previous7 he had published a letter stating that he was in favor of selecting electors by a joint
                    ballot of the legislature, also denying that he was a partisan of J. Q. Adams. He was evidently
                    drifting to fit public opinion. McCall was the successful candidate. The new assembly settled the
                    question by districting the state by providing for the choice of electors on a general ticket.</p>
            <p>More than two years before the elections of 1824 the question of candidates for the Presidency was
                    freely discussed in the state. William H. Crawford had, by giving the patronage of the <placeName>

                    cabinet member, Mr. Jackson 's pretentions were remote. He must prove himself a statesman.
                    Crawford, he thought, would be the choice of the West. His sentiments on internal improvements and
                    domestic manufacture were in perfect accord with those of the West.</p>
            <p>Later in the year the sentiment seemed to drift toward Clay as the candidate. In a series of three

                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>

                    the prospective candidates upon these subjects.11 He eliminated J. Q. Adams because he was ignorant
                    of the actual conditions, and saw a lack of interest in these subjects on the part of Calhoun and
                    Crawford. He said: <quote rend="blockquote">

            </p>
            <p>He then concluded that Clay was the only logical man. On the same date of "<placeName>

                    state during that period. The idea that they had as their champion a man whose life experience had
                    been the same as theirs outweighed all other considerations with them. The educating process had
                    done its work effectively and there was little doubt but that <placeName>

            <p>The question of an electoral ticket was the all-important question at that time. The law providing
                    for the selection of electors on a general ticket had only recently been passed (January 14,
                        1824).<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Neither state laws nor party machinery provided any means for
                    selecting a ticket. They were generally chosen over the country by newspapers advocating the use of
                    certain names. And by concensus of newspaper opinions the ticket was agreed upon, or it was chosen
                    by the adherents of a candidate in the state legislature. But even then there was no means of
                    binding the electoral candidate to vote for any certain candidate or candidates in the electoral
                    college. As early as May the Adams men had chosen Isaac Blackford of <placeName>

                            in disguise, and that should Clay be out of the question which is most likely these men will
                            then most likely vote for Crawford. The citizens of this State are not disposed to vote for

            <p>In Indiana Jacksonian democracy was not the rallying of the people about a great issue. The issues
                    that we are accustomed to associate with the early Jacksonians did not enter into public discussions
                    in the state in a material way until 1828, or until Jacksonianism was at least four years old.
                    Jacksonian democracy in Indiana was rather a spirit. It was the manifest expression of that intense
                    feeling that the common people were supreme. The least show of luxury was a sign of pride or
                        aristocracy.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The man who made such show was at once under suspicion. The
                    eastern politicians were the very incarnation of luxury and aristocracy. Jackson was the embodiment
                    of unsophisticated democracy. The frontiersman must fight for his existence and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> was his champion., The Indian had been his most deadly enemy and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> had mastered the Indian. The English had incited the Indian to murder and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> had humbled the English. The uncultured mind demanded a hero and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> met every qualification required of such a hero. So the campaign of 1824 was waged not
                    upon an economic or political principle, but about the popular hero, the man Andrew <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The four years' campaign that followed was not a struggle for the triumph of
                    a principle, but to vindicate an injustice to a popular hero, and political issues came into the
                    struggle as expediency or circumstance determined. As soon as the results of the contest in the

                            hinted that they, like the Swiss, would fight for those who would pay best. Overtures were

                            </placeName> would descend to such a mean barter and sale. I was of the opinion when I first
                            heard of this transaction that men professing any honorable principle could not nor would
                            not be transferred like the planter does his negroes or the farmer his team and horses. No
                            alarm was excited. We believed the Republic was safe. The nation having delivered <placeName>

                            </placeName> into the hands of Congress backed by a large majority of their votes, there was
                            no doubt in my mind that Congress would respond to the will of the nation by electing the
                            individual they had declared to be their choice, contrary to this expectation it is now
                            ascertained to a certainty that Henry Clay has transferred his interests to John <placeName>

                            is said and believed, should this unholy coalition prevail, Clay is to be appointed
                            Secretary of State. I have no fears in my mind. I am clearly of opinion we shall defeat

            <p>The non-partisan character of the contest is best shown by the vote. Ray who had been a partisan of
                    Clay in the Presidential election received 13,040 votes to 10,218 for Isaac Black-ford who headed
                    the Adams electoral ticket; while John H. Thompson who had not been prominent in the Presidential

            <p>The charge, however, was enough to kill whatever chances he might have had. Boone was opposed in the
                    election because he was a radical partisan, but no attempt to defend him on that ground was made.
                    When Stout, the leading Jacksonian editor, allowed the statement that, "Colonel Boone makes
                    a good representative and I hope he will be elected," to go into his paper it was with the
                    explanation: "Inserted by request and paid for."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> The charge
                    of partisanship was too much for Boone to overcome and he was defeated by a vote of 5,223 for Blake
                    to 5,202 for Boone while Shuler received only 1,626.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> In the Second district,
                    on account of the lack of opposition, there was no issue. In the Third district Mr. Smith and Mr.

                            go as far as the friends of that system. From these numerous votes given by him and which

                        <p>I have had the honor to receive your excellency's letter of the 30th ultimo
                                    inclosing resolutions of the state of Indiana, adopted as it appears with the view
                                    of ascertaining my opinions on certain political topics. The respect which I
                                    entertain for the executive and senators of your state, excludes from my mind the
                                    idea that an unfriendly intention dictated the interrogatories which are proposed.
                                    But I will confess my regret at being forced by this sentiment, to depart in the
                                    smallest degree from that determination on which I have always acted. Not, Sir, that
                                    I would wish to conceal my opinions from the people upon any political or national
                                    subjects; but as they were in various ways promulgated in 1824. I am apprehensive
                                    that my appearance before the public at this time, may be attributed, as has already
                                    been the case, to improper motives.</p>
                        <p>With these remarks I pray you, sir, to state to the senate of Indiana that my
                                    opinions at present are precisely the same as they were in 1823 and 1824, when they
                                    were communicated by letter to Dr. Coleman of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                                    </placeName>, and when I voted for the present tariff and for appropriations for
                                    internal improvements. As that letter was written when the divisions of sentiment,
                                    on this subject were as strongly marked as they are now, in relation both to the
                                    system, it is enclosed herein, and I beg the favor of your excellency to consider it
                                    a part of this communication. The occasion out of which it arose was embraced with a
                                    hope of preventing any doubt, misconstruction, or necessity for further inquiry
                                    respecting my opinions on the subject to which you refer particularly in those
                                    states which you have designated as cherishing a policy at variance with your own.
                                    To preserve our invaluable constitution and be prepared to repel the invasions of a
                                    foreign foe, by the practice of economy, and the cultivation within ourselves of the
                                    means of national defense and independence should be, it seems to me, the leading
                                    objects of any system which aspires to the name "American," and of
                                    every prudent administration of our government.</p>
                        <p>I trust, sir, that these general views taken in connection' with the letter
                                    enclosed and the votes referred to, will be received as a sufficient answer to the
                                    inquiries suggested by the resolution of the senate. I will further observe to your
                                    excellency that my views of constitutional power and American policy were imbibed in
                                    no small degree in the times and from the ages of the Revolution, and that my
                                    experience has not disposed me to forget their lessons. And in conclusion I will
                                    repeat that my opinions remain as they existed in 1823-1824 uninfluenced by the
                                    hopes of personal aggrandizements, and that I am sure, they will never deprive: me
                                    of the proud satisfaction of having always been a sincere and consistent Republican.</p>

                                    examination and revision of it, and so far as the tariff bill before us embraces the
                                    design of fostering, protecting and preserving within ourselves the means of
                                    national defense and independence particularly in the state of war I would advocate
                                    and support it. The experience of the late war [1812] ought to teach us a lesson and
                                    one never to be forgotten. If our liberty and republican form of government procured
                                    for us by our revolutionary fathers were worth the blood and treasure at which they
                                    were obtained, it surely is our duty to protect and defend them. Can there be an

                                    the want of proper means of defense during the last war, who would be willing again
                                    to hazard the safety of our country if embroiled, or to rest it for defense on the
                                    precarious means of national resource to be derived from commerce in a state of war
                                    with a maritime power who might destroy that commerce to prevent us obtaining the
                                    means of defense and thereby subdue us. I am sure he does not deserve to enjoy the
                                    blessings of freedom. Heaven smiled upon and gave us liberty and independence. The
                                    same providence has blessed us with the means of national defense. If we omit or
                                    refuse to use the gifts which he has extended to us we deserve not the continuation
                                    of his blessing. He has filled our mountains and our plains with minerals-with lead,
                                    iron and copper, and given us climate and soil for the growing of hemp and wool.
                                    These being the grand materials of our national defense they ought to have extended
                                    to them adequate and fair protection that our manufacturers and laborers may be
                                    placed on a fair competition with those of Europe, and that we may have within our
                                    country a supply of those leading and important articles so essential in war.</p>
                        <p>Beyond this, I look at the tariff with an eye to the proper distribution of labor and
                                    to revenue; and with a view to discharge our national debt. I am one of those who do
                                    not believe a national debt a national blessing, but rather a curse to the republic:
                                    in so much as it is calculated to raise around the administration a monied
                                    aristocracy, dangerous to the liberties of the country. This tariff—I
                                    mean a judicious one—presages more fanciful than real dangers. I will ask
                                    what is the real situation of the agriculturist? Where has the American a market for
                                    his surplus product? Except for cotton he has neither a foreign nor a home market.
                                    Does not this clearly prove, when there is no market either at home or abroad that
                                    there is too much labor employed in agriculture, and that the channels of labor
                                    should be multiplied? Common sense at once <list type="footnotes">

                                    this superabundance of labor; employ it in mechanism and manufacture, thereby
                                    creating a home market for your bread stuffs and distributing labor to the most
                                    profitable account, and benefit to the country will result. Take from agriculture in

                                    a home market for more breadstuffs than all Europe now furnishes us. In short, sir,
                                    we have been too long subject to the policy of British merchants. It is time that we
                                    should become a little more Americanized; and instead of feeding the paupers and

                        <p>It is thereby my opinion that a careful and judicious tariff is much wanted to pay
                                    our national debt, and afford us the means of that defense within ourselves, on
                                    which the safety of our country and liberty depends; and last though not least give
                                    a proper distribution to our labor which must prove beneficial to the happiness,
                                    independence, and wealth of the community.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s proved to be one of the most history-making letters ever sent into the
                    state. Until now the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> forces had been clinging to the personality of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They could justify themselves before the world by no reason or cause except righteous
                    indignation that so just and honest a man as he should suffer through the workings of corrupt public
                    men. Moreover they were met at every turn by the administration forces, with the cry of
                    "measures, not men" and preaching internal improvements and protective tariff. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> forces must have a principle a "measure" or their case was at least a
                    difficult one. The word "judicious" in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s letter to Dr. Coleman gave them their long desired measure. Hereafter,

                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>," they were styled the friends of a "judicious tariff." As
                    soon as the letter was published the Jacksonian press and politicians had their weapon to meet the
                    challenge of the Adams forces. The Adams men in great numbers, and without stopping to analyze the
                    real meaning <pb n="51" id="VAA4025-019-1-053"/> of the letter—if it had any, flocked to

            <p>The rejoicing over victory was not in proportion to the anger over defeat at the past election. The
                    responsibility of office was a new burden that they had not considered, and the perplexity of the

            <p>At Burnettsville in White county, Indiana, stands an old building now occupied as a dwelling, which
                    according to local tradition was the home of the first normal school in Indiana. It was conducted by
                    Joseph Baldwin, who came from Pennsylvania and opened a normal school at Burnettsville in 1857 at
                    the solicitation of his brother-in-law, Elder William Griggsby, then pastor of the Christian church
                    at Burnettsville. This little village, known in early years as Farmington, had long shown an
                    ambition to become an educational center, and five years before Mr. Baldwin's arrival a
                    stock company had been formed which resulted in the erection of the building above mentioned, to be
                    used strictly for school purposes. The school was called the Farmington Seminary, and the first
                    teacher was Isaac Mahurin, the organizer of the stock company and founder of the school. He was a
                    Methodist and a graduate of an eastern college. He only remained two years and was succeeded by an
                    Associate Presbyterian named Hugh Knickerbocker, who continued the school three years longer. Up to
                    that time the school had been known in common parlance sometimes as the Seminary and sometimes as
                    the academy, meaning in the popular mind a place where more than one teacher was employed and where
                    something higher than the Three R's was taught. Tradition says that though the community
                    was proud of its distinction as a center of higher learning there was a division of sentiment when
                    physiology was introduced as one of the branches of study, some of the fastidious considering it an
                    innovation bordering on the vulgar. But with literary societies, singing schools and writing schools
                    as evening accessories the public mind was so diverted that even the study of man's
                    internal economy ceased to cause rancor.</p>
            <p>At the end of the Knickerbocker regime the time seemed opportune for Joseph Baldwin to enter the
                    field with his ideas <pb n="58" id="VAA4025-019-1-060"/> of teacher training, and he came. He was an
                    enthusiast on the subject of normal schools and had the energy, judgment and fluency of speech to
                    give effect to his enthusiasm. He got at once in touch with the public by canvassing the country for
                    miles around, sowing circulars and posters broadcast and making public addresses on the subject
                    uppermost in his mind. As a result his school opened with a surprisingly large enrollment. It soon
                    overtaxed the capacity of the Seminary, and the Christian church near by was used to accommodate the
                    overflow. Among the students of this school was William H. Calkins of LaPorte, later representative
                    in congress from the Tenth district of Indiana, and a number of other young men who afterward
                    reached distinction either professionally or politically. On account of the success of this school,
                    Burnettsville, once nicknamed by scoffers "Git-away," came to be spoken of as
                    "the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Athens</settlement>
                    </placeName> of White county," and it deserved the name. White county bestowed upon the
                    head of its school the highest honor within her gift for men of erudition—the office of
                    school examiner, and he held it as long as he remained in the county.</p>
            <p>While in the high tide of his success at Burnettsville he sought a larger field and in 1859 removed
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kokomo</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There he founded a normal school which continued to operate for some years after he
                    had severed his connection with it. He also opened a similar school at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> and while there he was much in demand as a lecturer at teachers' institutes in
                    other counties. Here in 1867 his Indiana career closed. In that year he went to Missouri and was
                    lost to Hoosier view and in a few years practically to Hoosier thought. But to him the closing of
                    Indiana's gates behind him opened the pathway to enduring fame, and his subsequent career,
                    if no other part of his life, entitles him to the space here allotted to him. To his Missouri
                    biographer, Prof. E. M. Violette, we are indebted for a rich store of material, from which much that
                    follows has beeen compiled.</p>
            <p>Joseph Baldwin was born at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Newcastle</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>, and was educated at Bethany
                    college, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, where he sat under the personal instruction of Alexander <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the founder of the Disciples' church, who was then in his prime. In 1850 he
                    was married to Miss Ella Sophronia Fluhart of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and <pb n="59" id="VAA4025-019-1-061"/> went immediately to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, where he opened an academy at Platte City. The next year he and his wife went to
                    Savannah, that state, where for three years they were engaged jointly in the management of a young
                    ladies' boarding school. Even at that time he had taken high rank among the teachers of the
                    state, for at a meeting of the State Teachers' association held at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> he was elected one of its vice-presidents. Among the distinguished educators present at
                    that session was the great Horace Mann, from whom he drew much helpful and stimulating inspiration.
                    After four years' residence in Missouri he returned to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, where he attended the Lawrence County Normal school and also taught for a time in the
                    Millersville Normal school. His mind was evidently imbued with the thought of teacher training,
                    though the normal-school idea at that time had barely obtained a foothold in this country and normal
                    schools were limited to the far eastern states.</p>
            <p>Arriving at Burnettsville in 1857, he was given his first opportunity to put into effect his idea of
                    a training school for teachers. The success of his school has already been narrated. During his
                    residence at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kokomo</settlement>
                    </placeName> his teaching activities were suspended for a brief period of service in the Union army,
                    and on his return he opened a school at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> which continued until he entered upon his work in Missouri in 1867.</p>
            <p>It so happened that the same Elder Griggsby who had persuaded him to come to Burnettsville was then a
                    resident of Kirksville and had been urging him ever since 1860 to come to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>. He finally yielded to his brother-in-law's persuasions on learning that a
                    school at Kirksville known as the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cumberland</settlement>
                    </placeName> academy had been abandoned by the Presbyterians and the academy building was seeking an
                    occupant. After looking over the field he leased the building and opened a private school known as
                    the North Missouri Normal school. He at once began a publicity campaign similar in method to the one
                    he had conducted in connection with the Burnettsville school, except that his keynote from the first
                    was state supervision of teacher training. After three and a half years of this kind of propaganda,
                    including much intercession with legislatures, he had the satisfaction of seeing a state normal
                    school system adopted and the school at Kirksville taken over <pb n="60" id="VAA4025-019-1-062"/> as
                    part of the system. The achievement was so notable and Professor Baldwin's leadership in
                    the movement so generally acknowledged that he afterward became known as "the father of the
                    Missouri normal school system."</p>
            <p>Professor Baldwin's first step after deciding to locate at Kirksville was the selection of a
                    faculty for his school, and incidentally this proceeding introduces into this narrative several
                    other White county people. His staff of teachers consisted of himself and five associates, two of
                    whom, Mr. and Mrs. Frank L. Ferris, had been White county teachers. They had taught schools at
                    Idaville, Burnettsville and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Professor Baldwin, having personally observed their work, had conditionally
                    engaged their services before leaving Indiana. Professor Ferris was assigned to the principalship of
                    the model school established in connection with the normal, while his wife was employed as teacher
                    of the intermediate department. Professor Ferris also assisted Professor Baldwin during the summer
                    of 1867 in his canvass of northern Missouri in the interests of the new normal school. After three
                    years he severed his connection with the normal and became principal of the Kirksville public
                    schools. Later he went west on account of failing health and died at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Denver</settlement>
                    </placeName>, November 18, 1873. He was an ordained minister of the Universalist church but never
                    held a pastorate. Through the influence of Professor Ferris two other young men of this vicinity
                    were drawn to Kirksville and became students of the Baldwin institution. These were B. F. Heiny, who
                    later became cashier of the National bank of Kirksville, and H. C. Langley, who became a minister in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The first year of the new school, though full of promise, yielded no financial profit to the
                    hard-working president. In fact it fell $315 short of paying expenses. But the second
                    year showed a gratifying gain in attendance and after paying all expenses left $1,185 in
                    the president's pocket. From that time on the school was no longer an experiment but on the
                    contrary such a marked success as to make all <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> "sit up and take notice."</p>
            <p>The law finally enacted provided for two normal school districts with a school in each, and then
                    began a contest for the location of the schools. Largely through Professor Bald- <pb n="61" id="VAA4025-019-1-063"/> win's efforts in arousing the people of Adair county to the
                    point of a bond issue of $100,000, Kirksville was finally selected as the site, the
                    Baldwin school as the nucleus, and Joseph Baldwin as the principal of the First District Normal
                    school. Work was begun on a new building, and on February 13, 1873, it was dedicated with impressive
                    ceremonies and great rejoicing. For eleven pears Professor Baldwin continued at the head of this
                    state institution of his own creation, and then, yielding to the pioneer instinct which seemed to
                    have been born in him, he accepted the presidency of the Sam <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Houston</settlement>
                    </placeName> Normal institute at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Huntsville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
               </placeName>. This school had been established only two
                    years before and was then the only state normal school in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>. After holding this position ten years he was elected to the chair of pedagogy in the
                    University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>, and at the close of his active work there in 1897 he was made professor emeritus of
                    pedagogy in that institution. His death occurred January 13, 1899, at Austin, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>, in the 72nd year of his age.</p>
            <p>Professor Baldwin was a man of wonderful energy and diligence. Besides his work in the school room he
                    found time to answer many calls as a public speaker on educational and religious topics. He was an
                    elder in the Christian church and occasionally officiated as a minister. He was also in demand as a
                    writer, making frequent contributions to educational journals and at one time being assistant editor
                    of the <hi rend="i">American School Journal</hi>. He was the author of two books, one on <hi rend="i">School Management</hi> and one on <hi rend="i">Elementary Psychology</hi>. Both had a
                    wide reading in this country, and both were adopted by the government of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> for the schools of that country. His <hi rend="i">School Management</hi> was translated
                    into Spanish for use in <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName> and South America.</p>
            <p>The high regard in which he was held at Kirksville was shown not only during his active work there
                    but for many years afterward. Twelve years after he had severed his connection with the school and
                    gone to Texas a special day was set apart during the commencement week to be observed as Baldwin
                    Day. He was the guest of honor on that occasion, and no other day in the history of the institution
                    ever brought such a large attendance of former students, many of them distinguished men, as that
                    memorable day in June, 1893. Upon <pb n="62" id="VAA4025-019-1-064"/> his death five years later
                    memorial exercises were held at the normal school, and an entire evening was devoted to honoring his
                    memory as the founder of the school and of the normal school system of the state.</p>
            <p>Indiana may well consider it an honor to have been the nursery of Joseph Baldwin's
                    aspirations and the laboratory of his first experiments.</p>

                    every-day occurrence. One day the world acknowledges the genius who accomplishes these things, the
                    next he is forgotten or overshadowed in the presence of so many other persons of marked ability. We
                    have become accustomed to new methods of thought and procedure and new systems of government.</p>
            <p>A hundred years ago a man with a vision and a message stood out with striking prominence. Such a man
                    was Robert Owen who lived for an ideal and whose ruling passion was, in the words of his son, Robert
                    Dale Owen, "the love of his kind, individually and collectively." Robert Owen at
                    thirty-five had made almost a million dollars as a manufacturer; he then retired from business and
                    devoted the remainder of his life to the betterment of the working man, to the formation of
                    cooperative societies, the carrying out of a community experiment, to agitation for the enactment of
                    laws prohibiting child labor, for factory inspection laws, and for a better and fuller education of
                    the children in the schools; this all as long ago as the period of 1800.</p>
            <p>Robert Owen was born of humble parentage at Newtown, Montgomeryshire, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wlk">Wales</region>
                    </placeName>, May 14, 1771. His schooling was limited, for at the age of ten years he went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> to work as an apprentice to a Stamford draper. He worked in the draper shops until the
                    age of eighteen and during this time was a student of books and a great reader. He then went into a
                    partnership with a wire-worker named Jones making new machinery, just then invented, for spinning
                    cotton. He soon left Jones and went into business for himself. He prospered, and shortly became the
                    superintendent of a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Manchester</settlement>
                    </placeName> cotton <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-019-1-066"/> mill. Here he came intimately in contact
                    with the debased conditions of the working man, a thing which he had seen and noticed previously. He
                    viewed with fear the frequent riots which showed the discontent in the factory towns. He saw
                    children swallowed up at an early age in the industrial whirl, so young that they had no opportunity
                    for schooling.</p>
            <p>Being eminently successful as a cotton mill superintendent, on January 1, 1800, he assumed control of
                    the New Lanark (<placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>) cotton mills, which belonged to his father-in-law, David Dale. The latter had been a
                    most considerate mill owner and yet Owen found the same miserable industrial and home conditions in
                    New Lanark. Owen established free schools for the children, reduced the hours of labor, and improved
                    the conditions of the factory people by the teaching of cleanly habits. He established stores where
                    the people could buy at a slightly higher price than the mere cost of the goods and soon the people
                    of New Lanark showed the effects of these changed conditions in better efficiency in the factories.
                    The place soon had an international reputation and visitors came from all over the world to study
                    Owen's methods and results. Thus Owen's mills prospered, and at one time, when all
                    other mills were closed for lack of cotton, Owen continued to pay wages to his employees, a thing
                    previously unheard of. Even though Owen's mills were eminently successful financially, his
                    partners did not like his methods of dealing with the working Classes and many also accused him of
                    heresy in his moral and religious teachings. He was finally forced out of the New Lanark mills, and
                    sold his share in them for $800,000, but the working people in the town had become a
                    prosperous and contented people because of the better conditions under which they lived and worked.</p>
            <p>From then on Robert Owen devoted all his time to his public activities and he and his followers
                    became more active and. more insistent for the recognition of the rights of the workers. He
                    constantly labored for laws protecting childhood in industry and for free education of all children
                    in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. He secured the enactment of laws with the assistance of Sir Robert Peel for the
                    protection of child labor and these laws are the first on the statute books in the history of
                    nations providing for the interference of the government in local business <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-019-1-067"/> affairs. Owen wished to put his communistic theories into practice,
                    and, upon hearing of the desire of the Rappites in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, to sell out, he entered into negotiations with them with the result that he bought the
                    "Harmonie" community for less than $150,000, using part of his own
                    fortune for this purpose. Here he planned to experiment with his "new moral world"
                    where an industrial democracy was to be the keynote and the highest type of education was to be
                    given to all at no cost other than to the community at large.</p>
            <p>The existing community at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> had a religious bond as a basis for its existence and was founded by George Rapp, a
                    vine-dresser and farmer of plebian descent, but a man of unusual strength of character who, in 1803,
                    had brought a group of Würtemburg peasants from <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Butler county</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, that they might worship in their own way, free from the religious domination present
                    at that time in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>. Here they had the "community of equality," with all work done in
                    common, the funds and leadership being in the hands of George Rapp, who was also their religious
                    leader. This has been spoken of as a religious autocracy. The location in Pennsylvania was deemed
                    unfit after a time because of the distance from waterways where they might ship their products,
                    hence the community moved en masse to the east bank of the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName> in
                    Indiana about 20 miles north of its confluence with the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>. This was in
                    1815. Here they proceeded to clear and till the very fertile land and built a new town calling it
                    Harmonie. Nearly a thousand of the followers of George Rapp lived here and it was therefore the
                    largest town in the territory of Indiana [?]. Thirty thousand acres of land were held in common. The
                    farming equipment and other utensils were brought from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. Houses, both log and frame, were soon erected. Later brick houses were built, the
                    frame and the brick houses being constructed on the same design, and of equal size, because the
                    Rappites, as they were called, believed in the equality of every one. School houses were built, and
                    a large church. There were no gravestones or other markers in the Rappite graveyard, indicating that
                    even in death there was no difference, and today the moundless surface of the Rappite cemetery in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-019-1-068"/> bears silent witness to this fact. The funerals took place with
                    only the elders as witnesses and nothing was left on the spot to indicate the burial place of any
                    one, though a plat was kept indicating the location of each grave.</p>
            <p>The Rappites worked hard, and, the land being very fertile, they prospered, shipping the products of
                    the community to points along the <geogName>Mississippi river</geogName>. They had comfortable homes
                    and plenty in a land that was then almost a wilderness. George Rapp then decided to sell the
                    property, giving as a reason the malarious condition of the country, the unpleasant weather and also
                    the isolation and remoteness from the business centers of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. It is probable that Father Rapp, as he was called, felt that his hold over the people
                    would lessen if the life in Harmonie became too easy because of plenty. The community had been
                    built, the farms and industries were prosperous and the need of the intense hard work had decreased,
                    hence he decided to move to a new location where the pioneer trials and hard work incident to a new
                    location would again firmly place the Harmonists under his leadership and generalship. Hence Robert
                    Owen was welcomed as a purchaser when he wished to buy Harmonie for the place of his community
                    experiment. The Rappites then left in a body for a new site on the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>
                    just below <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> and where they located Economy, where they remained.</p>
            <p>Robert Owen came to America bringing part of his family with him. He delivered addresses in February
                    and March, 1825, in the hall of the house of representatives at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D. C., before two of the most distinguished audiences ever gathered in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which comprised the entire membership of both houses of congress, the judges of the
                    supreme court, the President and his cabinet and many distinguished citizens. He explained his
                    "new moral world," his plan for the improvement of the human race, and his
                    immediate project at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and stated that he desired volunteers for the new community explaining that
                    there was to be industrial equality and the best educational opportunities for all, especially the
                    children. He spoke in many other places in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> spreading his invitation broadcast. People of all kinds came to Harmonie to join his
                    community. There were cranks and agitators and <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-019-1-069"/> reformers of
                    every kind, some who thought it a place to live without working and others who came with a sincere
                    and serious desire to be working members of the colony and carry out the plan of the leader. On
                    April 27, 1825, Robert Owen addressed the membership of the new community at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for such was the new name, in the big church hall and outlined his plan for the
                    "new moral world" and the "Preliminary Society" was established.
                    At this time he said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I am come to this country to introduce an entirely new state of society; to change it from an
                            ignorant, selfish system to an enlightened social system which shall gradually unite all
                            interests in one, and remove all causes for contrast between individuals.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Such was the origin of the community. Farming and the dairy pursuits began; manufacturing and the
                    trades started up with Owen acting as a business manager for the time being; this management later
                    to be put in the hands of the communists. Owen had interested a William Maclure of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the community, who wished to put into practice his educational theories. Maclure was
                    a wealthy scientist interested in education and political economy and was likewise philanthropic. He
                    had been the principal founder of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> Academy of natural sciences and had made several geological studies of large parts of
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. He had tried out an educational scheme in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> which had failed, hence he ardently entered into Owen's plans and took charge
                    of the educational side of the experiment. His plan was to make <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> the center of education in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> through the introduction of the Pestalozzian system of teaching. For this purpose he
                    gathered at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> the most distinguished group of scientists and educators in America, among these being
                    Thomas Say, the zoologist, Charles Alexander Leseur, Constantine Samuel Raffinesque, Dr. Gerard
                    Troost, John Chappelsmith, an artist and engraver, Professor Joseph Neef, Madame Marie Fretageot and
                    Phiquepal d'Arusmont. Frances Wright, the enthusiastic advocate of "New
                    Principles," woman's suffrage and abolition lived for some years in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The four sons and one of Robert Owen's daughters also lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-019-1-070"/>
            <p>Then Robert Owen returned to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> to proceed with his work there, and the community was left in the charge of his son
                    Robert Dale Owen. There were, however, too many differing temperaments in the community and finally
                    petty bickerings and jealousies on the part of some of the members became so great that the spirit
                    of the place was lost, and the community gradually ceased to function as such and on March 28. 1827,

                    </placeName> was concerned but still held that the principle was correct.</p>
            <p>Robert Owen came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> at the time of the dissolution of the community, but immediately returned to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and for the rest of his life carried on propaganda for the principles of industrial
                    equality, free education of the young, and decent and respectable living conditions for the workers
                    in factory towns. He lectured all over Europe on socialism and his "new moral
                    world," taking part in co-operative congresses for many years. He also published a weekly
                    journal on these subjects. He became more radical as he grew older and his real influence then began
                    to decline. In 1854 he was converted to spiritualism by a medium from America, and published several
                    works on this subject.</p>
            <p>Owen was essentially a man with one idea, that of bettermen of the working man. The fact that he
                    himself had been a successful factory operator and owner compelled many to consider him and his
                    theories seriously. His factory had been wonderfully successful financially and the town of New
                    Lanark had a happy and prosperous people. Here careful attention was given to Owen's
                    theories because here they had worked. The practical success of New Lanark had enabled Owen to take
                    a definite stand and had assisted him in his preachings for social and industrial and educational
                    equality.</p>
            <p>Personally he was most amiable—his ruling passion was benevolence; he was exceedingly fond
                    of children, spent a fortune to promote the welfare of his race, had a command of temper which
                    enabled him to conciliate opponents and was obstinate without being irritable.</p>
            <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-019-1-071"/>
            <p>Owen's geniality, altruism, love of mankind, sweetness of temper and gentle disposition and
                    charm of manner were his outstanding temperamental traits. These different traits have appeared in
                    his descendants, some here and some there. They will be noted as they appear in the description of
                    the family which follows. The Owen charm and graciousness of manner is known to all who are
                    acquainted with the family of today. He died in 1857.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    country makes the Owen family one of interest to students of genealogy, biography, eugenics and
                    heredity. These three sons were Robert Dale Owen, the statesman, David Dale Owen, the geologist, and
                    Richard Dale Owen, the soldier and teacher of science. Hence the study of the Owen blood is of
                    interest and value. Robert Owen has been called "socialist," "a
                    reformer," "practical idealist," "philanthropist," etc.

                    respectable farmers of Newtown." "My mother," writes Robert,

                        <p>David Dale, born Ayrshire, 1738, under humble circumstances; educated in public schools,
                            journeyman weaver, even then expended a portion of his scanty wages in relieving his poorer
                            neighbors. With the steady perseverance of his country he gradually won his way to riches
                            and position; so that at middle age he was already a wealthy merchant and bank director. The
                            marriage with Ann <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                            </placeName> was a most harmonious union though brief. She died when her eldest child was
                            about twelve years old; and upon that child devolved the care of a widowed father and
                            younger sister; a charge the duties of which she fulfilled with a devotion and prudence
                            beyond her years. David Dale had become a mill owner. He first paid attention to the health
                            and morals of his people, trained them up in habits of industry and instructed them in the
                            necessary branches of education. Four hundred children were entirely fed, clothed and
                            instructed at the expense of Dale. He was very religious, being an
                            "independent," an order of Presbyterians, this sect having as its tenet
                            that a "laborer is worthy of his hire."</p>

            </p>
            <p>Dale was a man of abundant geniality; he was very tolerant and lacking in harshness toward offenders.
                    Robert Owen in <hi rend="i">Threading My Way</hi>, says of his father-in-law: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Mr. Dale was one of the most liberal, conscientious, benevolent, kind-hearted men I ever met
                            in my life; one universally respected for his simplicity and straightforward honesty of
                            character. From my marriage, until his death he and I never exchanged one unpleasant
                            expression or unkind word. Yet our religious opinions were quite different and we distinctly
                            knew the difference. He had a sense of the ludicrous and keenly enjoyed a joke, even at his
                            own expense. He died in 1806.</p>

                    respectable farmer living on his father's estates and married her according to the Scottish
                    law, legally. His parents refused to recognize the bride, hence he left his native country and
                    resided with her when off duty from the army, at a French seaport. He continued to live with his
                    wife until his death at the early age of 29, in 1708. He left one child only, named after the
                    grandfather who ignored its existence. At a later period the widow and her son brought suit to
                    procure the acknowledgment of the marriage and the recovery of her husband's property.

            <p>It was as a member of the Indiana constitutional convention in 1850 that he entered upon the period
                    of his greatest usefulness. John H. Holliday, the Indiana historian, says that Robert Dale Owen was
                    the most laborious and efficient member of that body, and that the law reforms, the provisions for
                    women's rights, and especially the free schools, were his work. Here he embodied into
                    actual practice and basic law the teachings and theories which his father and William Maclure had
                    worked our practically in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> thirty years previously. The constitution of 1850 and the school law of 1852 of Indiana
                    are the handiworks of Robert Owen and William Maclure living after them [??].</p>
            <p>In 1853 Owen was appointed <hi rend="i">chargé d'affaires</hi> at <placeName>

                    </placeName> and he remained at this post for six years. During this period he became an advocate of
                    spiritualism and wrote two books on the subject. His father had become a devotee of spiritualism in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> a few years previous to this. During the Civil war Robert Dale Owen gave his time and

                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and especially the latter's plans for the emancipation of the slaves. In
                    September, 1862, when the decision about emancipation of the slaves hung in the balance, he wrote to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> approving the step and this letter has been described as "an ever enduring
                    monument of dispassionate, well-reasoned, perfectly-poised deductions, at a very critical time in
                    the life of a great nation." "Its perusal thrilled me like a trumpet

                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Owen was appointed secretary of the Freed-man's Bureau near the close of the
                    war and acted as its executive for a time. He opposed then the giving of the franchise to the
                    negroes for a time until they had been trained to accept the duties of citizenship.</p>
            <p>For a period before his death "his mind was deranged by overwork—deranged but not
                    obscured—for during several months' residence in the hospital for the insane at <placeName>

                    </placeName> and lived there the remainder of his life. He was a farmer and has been considered the
                    best business man of this generation of the Owens. He also acted as guardian, settled estates, and
                    did other business for many people about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> and was very successful. He was very fond of people and enjoyed mingling with them,
                    and, although very popular, he was not interested in social activities as such. During the Civil war
                    he rose to the rank of Colonel. His interest in people and desire to do for others was a typical
                    Owen trait but the other traits of the Owens were not so characteristic in this man. His first wife,
                    Mary Sampson, was killed in a steamboat accident on the <geogName>Mississippi river</geogName>
                    during the Civil was. His second was Helen M. Shepard. She was reputed to have been the adopted
                    daughter of a poor widow of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. She was very beautiful physically. She bore two children, Grace and Margaret, to
                    Julian, and died at the age of twenty-seven. Nothing is known of her traits. Julian's third
                    wife was Annie Reed Cooper, by whom he has one child, Walter Dale. Julian survived his last wife,
                    dying in 1910 of paralysis.</p>
            <p>Grace Owen, Julian's oldest child and granddaughter of Robert Dale Owen, was born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1866. She was large physically, handsome, brilliant, gifted musically,
                    intellectually and socially. She travelled quite extensively and spent some time at Haifa in the
                    Holy Land with her aunt Rosamond. She married at about the age of twenty-four and died in 1891, at
                    the birth of her first child. Grace Owen is spoken of as the most brilliant of that generation and
                    one resembling the earlier Owens. Her husband, Charles W. Zering, was a school teacher, later
                    studied law and was very successful in later life. He was very intellectual. Their one child, Grace
                    Zering, born 1891, was tossed here and there as a child after the death of her mother, staying part
                    of the time with her aunt Margaret, the actress. She has travelled much. She has good descriptive
                    powers and some literary ability in writing. <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-019-1-080"/> She has the
                    brilliancy of the mother. She married Lieut. Com. Ellis Stone of the <placeName>

            <p>Margaret Owen, born 1870, full sister of Grace and granddaughter of Robert Dale Owen, was, as a young
                    girl, like the earlier Owens, gentle and kind, and still has the calm, equable disposition so
                    characteristic of the family. She, however, does not have the musical ability so often found. She
                    married William C. Clark, an actor, went on the stage with him in vaudeville and has travelled all
                    over the world. She now resides in <placeName>

            <p>Ernest Dale Owen, the third child of Robert Dale Owen, to grow up, born in 1838 in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was also trained abroad with the other children and received a cultural education. He
                    became an excellent violinist. He was trained in the law and later moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> where he practiced for many years. Ernest did not have the altruistic sense of the
                    Owens. When about seventy-five years old, while in a state of mental depression, he committed
                    suicide, this about 1914. His wife was Frances Mann, born 1855, one of three sisters who married
                    into the Owen family. She had no offspring and is now living with her sister in <placeName>

            <p>Rosamond Dale Owen Oliphant Templeton was the last child in this fraternity. She was born in 1843 and
                    went with the other children of Robert to Europe for her education, remaining in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and has lived most of her life there. She has travelled quite extensively, especially
                    in the Holy Land. She married first Sir Laurence Oliphant, who died of fever soon after in Serbia.
                    Her second husband was James Murray Templeton, Sir Oliphant's secretary, who mysteriously
                    disappeared from a ship in mid-ocean while returning from the Holy Land to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. It is supposed that while delirious from the effects of a tropical fever he jumped
                    overboard. Rosa is spoken of as a "gentle woman who reverts to the Owen <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-019-1-081"/> type." She has a quiet manner and fascinating personality and
                    although frail physically, she is alert mentally and full of cheerfulness and humor. She has a broad
                    streak of sentimentality and is emotionally very active. She was at one time an Episcopalian, later
                    a Theosophist and has recently been interested in other cults, and now considers herself a
                    spiritualist. She has written several books, one on woman suffrage, and one called the <hi rend="i">Mediators</hi>, developing in this the theory of a new cult. During the World war she turned
                    her house over for the care of wounded soldiers and spent so much money for the care of these
                    disabled men that she rendered herself almost penniless. She has used most of her fortune in
                    benevolence of this and other kinds. She now lives in Worthing, <placeName>

            <p>This ends the description of Robert Dale Owen and his descendants. Robert, himself, was a near
                    genius, if not possessing genius abilities. Rosamond is the only other one who has stood out as a
                    prominent figure though it is interesting what would have been the future of Grace Zering had she
                    lived. The Owen charm of manner and graciousness is found in many of these as elsewhere in the
                    family.</p>

            <p>William Owen was the second child of Robert Owen who came to America. He was born in <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName> in 1802. His education to the age of fifteen was conducted by private tutors: after
                    that he went with his older brother, Robert, to the college of M. de Fellenberg at Hofwyl in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland</region>
                    </placeName>. Here he remained three years, returning to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> imbued with the idea that rich and poor were fundamentally alike and that manliness and
                    an upright character were the ideals to be sought by every one. For the next few years he worked
                    with his father and became skilled in the manufacture and handling of cotton goods. At the age of
                    twenty-two he came with his father to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and went about the country with him on his first lecture trip and then accompanied him
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> for the beginning of the experiment there. Here he remained the rest of his life except
                    for short business trips. <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-019-1-082"/> He had the business mind of his
                    fraternity and the brothers referred all such details to him and looked to him for advice in all
                    practical affairs. He had the gentleness and sweetness of disposition of the Owens but seems to have
                    been a negative character in contrast to his brothers. He died at the age of forty in 1842, cause
                    unknown; his tombstone in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> cemetery has the following inscription only, "A native of <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>

                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a witty, bright, sparkling young woman, born in 1819 and who died in 1837 soon after
                    the birth of her first child. Her father, Samuel Bolton, went from <placeName>

                    </placeName> where she studied music, especially voice culture. She sang very well. She returned to
                    this country after a time. She had the placid temper of the Owens and the good nature of her father
                    and no combativeness. She was not interested in the domestic matters of the household, neither did
                    she have any interest in public affairs. As a young woman she was considered a beauty. Later in life
                    she became very deaf. She married twice; her first husband was Henry F. Fitton, by whom she had six
                    children. He died in 1873 and she then married Joel W. Hiatt, with whom she lived until her death a
                    few years ago. Her first husband, Fitton, was born in 1837, in <placeName>

                    </placeName> army during the Civil war and when discharged had the rank of captain. He entered
                    business, was shrewd and did well financially. He had no particular outstanding traits or character.
                    He had a good tenor voice which, however, had never been trained. The children of Mary Francis Owen
                    and Henry Fitton are: Frank, William, who died young, Mary, Catharine, Herbert, and Florence. Joel
                    Hiatt, Mary's second husband, is still living.</p>
            <p>Frank Fitton, son of Mary and grandson of William Owen, born about 1860, had a good education. He has
                    been interested in several business activities and is at present engaged <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-019-1-083"/> as a grain broker and in charge of farm lands in Posey county, formerly

                    Posey county, Indiana, and acquired large tracts of fine farm land where he cultivated corn
                    extensively. His son, Alfred Ribeyre, is now known as the "Corn King of <placeName>

                    and details of the home. Mary died in 1911 at the age of thirty-seven, leaving two children, Robert,

                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> where she spent the rest of her life. There she conducted a school for children in her
                    own home. This was an "oral" school similar to the one her sister-in-law Mary had
                    taught. Her husband was Robert Henry Fauntleroy, born 1806 in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. His father was Joseph Fauntleroy of Virginia and he, with a Mr. Taylor, had bought the
                    store and merchandising rights from the Owens during community times. Robert, then aged twenty, kept
                    the meteorological records for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> during community days and for a time after that collaborated in these reports with the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His profession was that of a geologist though he was a mathematician and an astronomer
                    also. He was an inventor of several things including a special kind of organ. He was musical,
                    playing the flute and violin and other instruments well. He was called the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> because of his distinguished appearance and bearing, though he really was very gentle
                    in his manners. Robert carried on the Southern Coast survey for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government and was chief of the Geodetic service and in this work travelled extensively

                    </placeName>. Rappite House No. 52 was his home in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, as it was <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-019-1-085"/> also the home of Robert Dale Owen and
                    Thomas Say, the Zoologist, at other times, and was also the birthplace of the first Woman's
                    club in America, the Minerva club. This house is now called the Fauntleroy Home.</p>
            <p>Jane survived Robert by twelve years, dying in 1861. They had six children, two dying in infancy and
                    the others, Constance, Ellinor, Edward and Arthur, reaching maturity. The oldest, Constance
                    Fauntleroy, born 1836, is the one individual in this generation of Owens who approached nearest to
                    the genius type. She received her early training at home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At the age of five she was a creditable performer on the piano. She also developed a
                    remarkable ability for story writing and den very young wrote her first poem. During her subsequent
                    attendance at the school in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> she busied herself in writing stories, poems and songs. Upon the death of her father
                    the family went to Stuttgart, <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, where Constance, then sixteen, devoted herself to the study of music, the languages,
                    drawing and painting, her tutor on the piano-forte being Boherez, a pupil of Moscheles. At the age
                    of twenty-two, she returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> where, in 1858, she organized the first woman's club in America. This society
                    was known as the Minerva club. This club had a full set of duly elected officers and carried on its
                    business under regular parliamentary rules. She had become a religious convert while in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> and after returning to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> became a zealous worker in that field. In 1861, she married Dr. James Runcie and soon
                    moved from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, where Dr. Runcie was rector of the Episcopal church and there Constance
                    founded a Brontis club, literary in nature. A few years later they moved to <placeName>
                  <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>, <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
               </placeName>, which was her home the rest of her life. Here Dr. Runcie held the
                    pastorate of Christ church as long as he lived.</p>
            <p>In <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>, she, in conjunction with her husband, established the Christ church league for the
                    purpose of stimulating interest in art and literature. She organized the Runcie club in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> and for many years was the intellectual light of that city. <hi rend="i">Divinely
                    Led</hi> is the story of her conversion to religion and appeared in 1873. In 1888, her verse was
                    collected in a volume entitled <hi rend="i">Poems, Dramatic and Lyric</hi> while <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-019-1-086"/>
                    <hi rend="i">A Burning Question</hi> was another story published in 1891. Her musical career extends
                    over many years. Her daughter says the following of her mother: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Music was the natural expression of her rhythmic and poetic soul. Her music is essentially
                            melodic and graceful; it is not bromidic, it is distinctive, it never palls on the ear, and
                            much of it has a passion of feeling, notably the religious pieces. Half of her forty pieces
                            are sacred, the others show immense versatility. She wrote one operetta, <hi rend="i">The
                                Prince of Asturia</hi>, full of drollery and laughing humor, which is still in

            </p>
            <p>Constance had a scientific mind and a keen understanding of scientific problems. She read many
                    scientific works and when it is remembered that her father and two maternal uncles were eminent
                    scientists, it is not strange that she had this interest so deeply ingrained in her. She called
                    Science the "Handmaid of Religion," and did not see any clash between the two. She
                    liked to feel always that she was teaching and giving out information. She has written some poetry;
                    the opening ode for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Exposition, and the book of, poems as mentioned above. She was a beautiful reader of
                    prose and poetry and enjoyed doing it. She was deeply religious and assisted her husband greatly in
                    his parish work. She played the piano by ear imperfectly but with a sympathetic touch, her daughter
                    states.</p>
            <p>Constance had a strong family feeling and was somewhat domestic in her ways. She had a keen sense of
                    duty to her family, her friends, all the world and especially the church, and was so dominated by
                    that sense as to make her sometimes appear selfish and egotistical. She did not have the gentle,
                    altruistic nature so characteristic of the Owens, as strongly as did her sister Ellinor. Constance
                    died in 1911, outliving her husband and leaving four children.</p>
            <p>Her husband, James Runcie, was born near Dundalk, <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>

                    </placeName>, later coming to this country, where he studied for the Episcopal ministry under Bishop
                    Upfold of Indiana. He served parishes at <placeName>

               </placeName>, he being at this latter place at the time of his death. He
                    was not a High Churchman, his sermons <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-019-1-087"/> were written and simple.
                    "He was first of all a pastor and children loved him and his parishioners were very
                    reverential toward him." He was studious but not literary, unselfish and benevolent. Just
                    previous to his death he declined the election to the Bishopric. He died in 1889 of hernia. He and
                    Constance had four children, Blessing, Ellinor, Roy and Percy, all living now in <placeName>

                    </placeName> and has lived there since then. She had the quiet charm and simple honesty of the
                    Owens. She is a woman of high principles, makes friends easily, and likes society. She is considered
                    by all a fine character, unselfish, interested in others and of fine sensibilities. Her husband,
                    Elliott Marshall, born in 1851 in <placeName>

            <p>Fauntleroy Runcie, born 1864, is the second child in the Runcie family. He has the child-like
                    simplicity and faith of the early Owens in the goodness of the world. He has a fine tenor voice and
                    has sung for many years in the Christ church choir in <placeName>

            <p>Returning to the main line again, we next take up Ellinor Fauntleroy, daughter of Jane and Robert,
                    born 1837. She travelled with her mother in Europe when young. and again later in life visited
                    Europe. She had many of the Owen traits—quiet in manner and temper, a woman of judgment
                    and thought. She has been considered the one in this fraternity who most nearly approximated Robert
                    Owen in his love of mankind. She always imagined herself an invalid physically and so was quite
                    inactive. She married George Davidsoll and had three children by him. She died in 1908 in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. George Davidson, the husband, was born in Nottingham, <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, May 9, 1825, and came to this country when he was seven years of age. His early
                    schooling was in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His first scientific work was in the geodetic field and astronomical surveys in the
                    eastern part of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> for the government geodetic service. Later he was sent to the Pacific coast, this in
                    1850, and there he had charge of the coast surveys of <placeName>
                  <country reg="cau">California</country>, <country reg="oru">Oregon</country>, <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="aku">Alaska</country>
                    </placeName>. He retired from the coast and geodetic survey work after fifty years service. In 1870
                    he had been appointed honorary professor of geodesy and astronomy and later was professor of
                    geography at the University of California and kept this latter chair until his death. He was a
                    member of many learned bodies including the National Academy of Science. This man, of Scotch
                    ancestry, was witty and a brilliant conversationalist, but a man of contrasts, grouchy at times;
                    very pleasant at others. He had the same lack of self-consciousness so marked in Robert Owen.
                    Through his work in the geological service of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, he became intimate with David Dale and his brother Richard, the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> geologists, and married their niece, Ellinor Fauntleroy. Their children are three in
                    number, George, Tom and Ellinor. George, born 1865, entered <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> college, where he had a <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-019-1-089"/> brilliant scholastic
                    record, but when he left college was a physical wreck. He and his brother Tom had marked mechanical
                    ability, a trait of the Fauntleroy blood, and after graduation built a yacht between them, and did
                    other things of the same sort. His eyes had become weak through too much study and George later went
                    on a ranch in the far west as an overseer. At the age of fifty he committed suicide, a result of his
                    continued ill health. He was gifted in intellectual qualities, an Owenite in many particulars, but
                    more dominant in character than his sister Ellinor. He refused to marry a woman whom he loved
                    because of his ill health and desired not to produce children who might be weak. Tom, his brother,
                    born about 1868, was also a fine student at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> college and was mechanically inclined. He is now employed in a law office, is
                    unmarried, and lives with his sister in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">San
                        Francisco</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
               </placeName>. The
                    sister, Ellinor Davidson, born 1878, had a high school education in California and associated with
                    the cultivated and highly trained associates of and visitors to her father's home, he being
                    one of the intellectual lights of the west at that time. She has never married and has travelled but
                    little. She is a fine conversationalist, a woman of high ideals and very philanthropic in nature and
                    ideals, aided in this through the property left to her by her father. She has much of the altruism
                    of the early Owens.</p>
            <p>The other two children of Jane and Robert Fauntleroy never married. Edward Henry, born 1841, was
                    educated abroad with the rest of the Fauntleroy children. At nineteen he had returned to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and was assisting his father on the western coast survey when he became ill, died
                    suddenly, and was buried in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His brother Arthur Robert, born 1843, became a civil engineer. He was always
                    successful in his profession, was a good business man, and acquired property and holdings. He had a
                    droll humor, good disposition, was generous, and liked by everyone. He never married and died at the
                    age of forty-one of pneumonia, being in <placeName>

            <p>The Fauntleroy descendants have shown a brilliant intellectual development, some music and other
                    production, but the strain at the present time is dying out, only one of this <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-019-1-090"/> group, Jean Savage, having young offspring. The Owen-Fauntleroy strain
                    then is practically gone.</p>

            <p>David Dale Owen was the next younger child of Robert Owen after Jane. He was born in Lanarkshire, <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>, in 1807, and received his early education in <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName> and later was a student with Richard at Fellenberg's School at Hofwyl, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland</region>
                    </placeName>, where his two older brothers had been trained. He came to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> soon after the beginning of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> experiment in January, 1828, being then about twenty years old. He probably never took
                    any prominent part in the organization or activities of the community other than as one of its
                    members. After the breaking up he went to Europe to pursue his studies in geology and natural
                    science later returning to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in 1833. He then attended the Ohio Medical college where he took a medical degree in
                    1835. In 1837, he was commissioned by the state legislature to make a preliminary geological survey
                    of Indiana, and in June, 1839, was appointed geologist of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. His first big undertaking for the government was a minute examination of the lands of
                    Iowa and Missouri for general and mineral resources. In this work he trained his own assistants.
                    This was the very first geological investigation of that type conducted under authority of the
                    national government. This report was published in 1844. The headquarters of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> geological survey were then at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> and remained there until 1856 when they were removed to the Smithsonian Institution at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, just finished at that time.</p>
            <p>In 1849 David Owen started a survey of Minnesota territory which lasted three years. The report
                    contained among other things numerous plates, all drawn by Owen, some of them king of the gigantic
                    mammal remains of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>. From 1854 to 1857 David Dale Owen was state geologist of Arkansas and in his work
                    there was assisted by his pupil, Prof. E. E. Cox. In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName>, his health was affected by the exposure to the wet country, then full of fevers, and
                    his death, <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-019-1-091"/> four years later, was hastened by this work. In 1859
                    he was appointed state geologist of Indiana. He died in 1860, shortly after taking up his last work.
                    His collection, which was a remarkably complete one, was purchased by the state of Indiana some
                    years ago and is now in the State University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. David was succeeded in Indiana by his brother Richard. The development of geological
                    research in this country is thus seen to have been closely associated with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Owen family.</p>
            <p>David was a mild-tempered, quiet acting man who lived such within himself. He was not as aggressive
                    as his brothers. He was always studious and was imbued with a strong scientific, searching mind. He
                    was of slight build and ascetic appearance. His death at the age of fifty-three, was caused by
                    stomach trouble. His published works are found in the official reports of the Government and in
                    different state departments of geology.</p>
            <p>David's wife was Caroline Neef, daughter of Joseph Neef, the Alsatian teacher brought to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> by William Maclure for his school. Born in Neef's family, she had a good
                    education and a fine cultural and intellectual environment. She was a good housekeeper and a fine
                    mother to her children. She was born in 1815 in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> and died comparatively young in 1854 at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Francis Joseph Nicholas Neef, was educated for a priest and spoke six languages. He revolted from the
                    priesthood, as he grew older, and was a soldier for a time, fighting under Napoleon for ten years.
                    He was shot in the face near the nose, the bullet remaining in the head. He turned his attention to
                    education after this injury which prevented his further army service. He joined himself to
                    Pestalozzi in Switzerland and when Pestalozzi opened his branch school in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> he sent Neef to be its head. Here Maclure became acquainted with Neef. During this time
                    Neef had married a Louise —, the daughter of a stern, hard-hearted man, and had one child
                    Victor, born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Maclure brought Neef and his family to America starting a school near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where the Pestalozzian system of education was used. Here Admiral Farragut was one of
                    the pupils. Here Neef had several children born, Louisa, Wilhelmina, Zulina, who died young, Caro-
                        <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-019-1-092"/> line and Anne Eliza. They lived on the banks of the
                    Schuylkill, where the school was situated then later moved to Kentucky where Neef had a farm. He
                    next went to Port <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fulton</region>
                    </placeName>, near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At this time Louise, the wife, bought a piano, the first piano in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and a great curiosity. She had taught her husband to sing. From Port <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fulton</region>
                    </placeName>, the family at Owen's and Maclure's request, moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The whole family then moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where the father taught French. Victor left home, worked in a lumber camp, caught the
                    fever, came home and died. They later returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> where the family remained. In later years Joseph became nearly blind. His portrait was
                    then painted by D. D. Owen; it now hangs in Mrs. Snedeker's library at Hempstead.</p>
            <p>David and Caroline's children are four in number: Alfred D., William H., Nina and Anna.
                    Alfred, the oldest, was born in 1841 in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and at the age of fourteen went to Europe with the Fauntleroy children to study. He
                    remained away two years and during this time visited <placeName>
                  <country reg="enk">England</country>, <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
               </placeName>, and other parts of Europe.
                    The Civil war started soon after his return to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and he was one of the first to enlist. He was once made prisoner but was later
                    exchanged. He was sent home sick but recuperated and returned to fight to the end. He rose to the
                    rank of Colonel in the service. It is said that "his affection, merriment, ardor for the
                    cause and tenderness of heart made him peculiarly loved by all who came in contact with him during
                    the service." Soon after returning from war he married Anna Belle <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Caldwell</settlement>
                    </placeName> of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. She was born in 1849 and died in 1906. Alfred was a banker in company with Charles
                    Parke, his brother-in-law, but his goodness of heart in lending money to anyone who needed it
                    irrespective of a man's ability to repay, was too much for him financially. As an older man
                    he was broken but not dependent. He had the Owen kindly disposition and good temper but not the
                    social mind characteristic of his uncle Robert. He died of blood poisoning at the age of sixty-two,
                    having lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, practically all his life. He had little musical ability, his wife and
                    children none. He had five children: David, Jessie, who married William Haas, Alfred, Helen who
                    married John Bald- <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-019-1-093"/> win, and William. These children are now
                    grown up and scattered in Oklahoma and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>William H. Owen, born 1847, was the second child of David Owen. He received his education in Indiana
                    and became a banker at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was considered a good business man and held in very high esteem there. He was the
                    only scientist of his generation, his chief interest being in astronomy, which he studied for many
                    years. He had the even Owen temperament and led a quiet, clean life, was very economical in his
                    habits, and died in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1896.</p>
            <p>Nina Dale Owen was the third child of David and Caroline Neef. She showed none of the high
                    intellectuality of the Owens; her childlike sympathy was her chief characteristic. She was genial,
                    witty and appreciative of humor, as were most of the Owens, and possessed the family charm of manner
                    and graciousness. She was educated in music and was very talented in that line as were all her
                    children; both she and they played and sang well. She wrote some music but has never published any.
                    She and the family moved from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, their home, to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> that the children might have an opportunity to procure the best musical education. She
                    was born in 1849 and died in 1911 of arterio-schlerosis. Her husband, Charles Parke, born 1845, was
                    a banker in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName> for many years and successful in his business. He had a calm but firm disposition, was
                    self-sacrificing for his family, but selfish with respect to the outer world. He was apparently not
                    musical, but after association with his wife in her musical sphere became very appreciative of good
                    music. Book-collecting became his hobby. For many years he lived at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where his banking business was located, while his family were in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> for their musical training, travelling between the two places at regular intervals. He
                    died in 1902 leaving five children: Caroline, Ada, Julius, Anna and Nina. All of these children have
                    possessed remarkable musical traits and these are noted specifically later.</p>
            <p>Caroline Dale Parke, born 1871 in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, is a true "Owenite," a charming, cultivated woman with a
                    beautiful character. The customs of today horrify her. She is distinctly of the Mid-Victorian age
                    and has a desire to accomplish but is impractical. Her outstanding characteristics <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-019-1-094"/> are her simplicity and lack of self-consciousness, and her enjoyment of
                    humor in others. She is a lover of the Greek though not a student of the old Greek language and her
                    book <hi rend="i">The Coward of Thermopylae</hi> is a fine exposition of her ideas of the culture of
                    the Greeks. She is now writing another story of the Greeks. <hi rend="i">Seth Way</hi>, written by
                    Caroline, is a narrative of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> days during Owen's time and is in the form of a story told to her by her
                    grandmother who lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> at the time. It is an attempt to put forth Owen's ideas of his "new
                    moral world" and communism and brings in the activities of the scientists who were at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>

                    Caroline is a gifted but not inspired musician. She plays the piano and has written some music, none
                    published. She married Charles H. Snedeker, the Episcopal Rector of St. George Parish at Hempstead,
                    Long Island. She resides at the rectory at Hempstead. She has no children.</p>
            <p>Ada Parke, her sister, was born in 1873. She was interested in botany, zoology, chirography, French
                    and Italian and studied these over a period of years, but she was not as intellectual as Caroline.
                    She studied voice culture in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> under Jean De Reszke and had a fine colorature voice but she found she was not gifted
                    in music and turned to charity work. She has always played the viola. She returned to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and after spending some time in an Episcopal training school, joined a religious order
                    and worked the rest of her life in a Magdalen Home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brooklyn</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Owen altruism was strong in Ada and she took up this work to do her share for the
                    good of the world. She had many serious illnesses during her life and her health was always poor.
                    She was therefore forced to lead a comparatively quiet life. She developed much charm after entering
                    the sisterhood, but was always very retiring and very unassuming. She had a droll humor. She died in
                    1918 of Bright's Disease.</p>
            <p>Julius, brother of Ada and Caroline, born 1875, had scarlet fever when young and was unconscious for
                    some days during the illness. Otherwise he had no disease history. When young he did not seem to be
                    interested at all in musical matters, but <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-019-1-095"/> at the age of
                    fourteen, took up the study of the cello and became a skilful player and played true as a man.
                    Because of this decided musical ability, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> Symphony orchestra made him an offer, but his father preferred a business training for
                    him and he was sent to Yale university to study architecture. After graduation he lived in various
                    places and worked as a draftsman and though interested and happy in his work was not successful and
                    worried much over the money affairs of his family. It has been said that Julius should have been
                    given the opportunity to have developed his one genius trait, that of music, in which he was very
                    much interested. Julius died in 1912 leaving a wife, May Trivett, and three children. His wife, also
                    a musician, taught the piano after her husband's death to support the family. She also has
                    composed. The oldest child, Robert, born 1904, plays the violin, Loraine, born 1908, plays both the
                    harp and the violin well and Julius, now twelve, shows marked ability with the violin. They all live
                    at 95 Richton Ave., <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Anna, born 1877, sister of Julius, also had scarlet fever as a child. As she grew older she became
                    more interested in people and became quite altruistic, being especially good to little children. She
                        resembled<hi rend="sup">1</hi> the Parkes in temperament and was more high-tempered than any of
                    her sibs. She was very musical, playing the violin, but she did not have as much music in her as did
                    her younger sister Nina. She was very attractive physically. Her husband, Carl Maier, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Los Angeles</settlement>
                    </placeName>, comes from a musical family. His mother was an opera singer; his mother's
                    uncle was a cellist and his father had some musical heredity. Their one son, Owen Maier, born 1911,
                    is just now beginning to play on the piano, and, in the opinion of Mrs. Snedeker, with whom he is
                    now living, will some time be a fine performer. Anna died in 1913.</p>
            <p>Nina, born 1880, the last child of Charles Parke, was very musical. She played the violin and the
                    cello with perfect sense of rhythm and tone. She does not have the big technic of a concert player
                    because she has a small hand. She is practical and domestic in nature, more so than any of the
                    Parkes and has the altruistic note of the Owens, like her sister Anna, and more of the Owen charm
                    than Caroline. She married Dr. Frederick Stillwell and resides at 3770 Reading Road, <placeName>

               </placeName>. They
                    have one child, Caroline, born 1911, who has a remarkable sense of music, both in melody and rhythm,
                    but not as developed as that of her uncle and aunts in the preceding generation. This is the last of
                    the Parkes.</p>
            <p>Anna Owen, daughter of David Dale Owen, is next and last in the list of his children. She was always
                    mentally alert and a tomboy as a child. She was intellectually interested in many things and had
                    many of the characteristic Owen traits though not in as strong a degree as the older members of the
                    family. Her first husband was named Shult; her second by whom she had all her children, was Charles
                    Crawford, a business man. She lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Bay <placeName>

                    years later. Owen received a college education and entered the railroad business where he has been
                    successful He has some of the Owen altruism and charm of manner. He is married and has three small
                    children and now resides in Bay <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Louise, his sister, has the Owen altruism and is personally unselfish and very kind to
                    others. During the World war she worked in a railroad office and did very, well. She also resides in
                    Bay <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>This completes the story of David's children. The children of Alfred have had none of the
                    distinctive Owen traits of character. One group that of Nina, has shown a strong musical strain. One
                    in that group also is a writer of some note. Otherwise the Owen intellectual ability of old has not
                    appeared in this group though the Owen temperament has been quite prominent.</p>

            <p>Richard Owen, the last son of Robert, born January 6; 1810, in Lanarkshire, <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>, received his early training and education in the Lanark grammar school after which he
                    was a student at Hofwyl in Switzerland as were his other brothers. He left Hofwyl and studied for a
                    time in the Ander-sonian Institute in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Glasgow</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In 1828 he came to this country, to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and taught for a time in the community <pb n="95" id="VAA4025-019-1-097"/> schools.
                    After the breaking up of the community he went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> where he engaged in business but subsequently returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> where he owned and operated a steam flour mill and also managed a stock farm. In 1847
                    he fought in the Mexican war and immediately after that assisted his brother David in his geological
                    work. In 1849 he became professor of natural science in the Western Military Institute of Kentucky
                    and he continued to hold that chair after that school became the academic school of the University
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Medical College. He then became assistant geologist of the state of Indiana. He rose to
                    the rank of colonel during the Civil war and during part of this time was commanding officer of the
                    prison camp for Confederate soldiers at Camp Morton, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The esteem in which he was held by the prisoners is shown by the fact that some years
                    later these same Confederate prisoners placed a bust of Colonel Owen in the State House in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and inscribed to that effect. In 1864 he accepted the chair of natural science in the
                    state university of Indiana and held that until 1879. Besides geology and natural science, he has
                    published a paper in meteorology, terrestrial magnetism and seismology.</p>
            <p>Richard Owen was a gentleman of the old school, gracious, calm, lacking in self-consciousness. He was
                    altruistic in nature and especially interested in children. In later years he became more irritable
                    and cross and moody at times. He had no particular musical ability. In later years he was very deaf.
                    He died in 1890 at the age of eighty. "His first desire was to be virtuous, his second to
                    be wise," is found written on his tombstone.</p>
            <p>His wife was Anna Neef, sister of Caroline Neef who married David Dale Owen. She was a woman of high
                    ideals and principles, kindly and altruistic, witty and vivacious. She imbibed information without
                    being a student. She was the first lady of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, socially. She was born in 1819 in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, died in 1895, and is buried in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Richard and Anne had two children, Eugene and Horace. The former, Eugene Fellenberg,
                    received his education in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. He became a farmer and raised stock. He studied the pedigrees of his cattle
                    scientifically as he did other things in which <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-019-1-098"/> he was
                    interested. He was a dreamer, however, and note a good business man. Easy, generous and confiding,
                    like most of the Owens, he lost much money in various ventures, some in a land scheme in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>. He was an officer in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> army during the Civil war. He was always deaf and this increased with age. He married
                    Della Mann and lived in New Hamony all his life. His death occurred in 1905. His Wife, Della, born
                    1843, had little education and training; her information has been absorbed through contact with
                    others. She is kindly and charitable in thought and deed. She has been industrious all her life and
                    a good housekeeper. Her parents died young and she was brought up in Mary Fitton's home.
                    Her father was a man of fair intelligence, by profession, a physician. Two sisters of Della have
                    married into the Owen family; otherwise there are no data of Della's family. Now, at the
                    age of seventy-eight, she is a gentle lady, still active. Eugene and Della had three children,
                    Howard, who died at the age of eleven, Malcolm and Robert Dale. Malcolm, born in 1870 in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, attended college at Indiana university where he was very popular. He later studied law
                    with his uncle Ernest in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and since that time has been successful in his law practice. Malcolm is courteous,
                    gracious and kindly, a typical Owen in temperament. He married his cousin, Catherine Fitton, as
                    previously mentioned, has-two children, and lives in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Malcom's brother, Robert Dale, born 1879, was a handsome boy and later a fine looking man.
                    He was more democratic than his father. He had good business ability and was employed as a
                    travelling man for a bank furnishing house in Des Moines, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>. He lacked certain inhibitions. He died of disease in 1917. He was never married.</p>
            <p>Horace Pestalozzi Owen was the second child of Richard and was born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1842. He received his early education in private schools and the Western Military
                    Institute at Blue Lick Springs, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, an institution owned by his father and General Bushnell Johnson, which later became
                    part of the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> as previously stated. About this time the sectional feeling that preceded the Civil war
                    was growing more and more bitter, and on this account the father came north. Colonel Richard Owen
                    was state geologist at this <pb n="97" id="VAA4025-019-1-099"/> time and Horace assisted him in this
                    work for several years. Then the Civil war came and Horace enlisted in the service, roe rapidly, and
                    was adjutant of a brigade when he resigned in 1863 to return to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> to care for his mother, his father remaining in the service until the end of the war.
                    He turned to business and entered the implement business with V. C. Duclos as a partner. He was
                    later in the dry goods business, then in the grain business in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> and became cashier of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Banking company at its organization. He later became president of the bank and held the
                    position until he died. He served as a member of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> school board for many years and president of the Workingman's Institute. He

            <p>Horace had the Owen characteristics to a very marked degree, and was much like his father. He stands
                    out in this group and elsewhere than in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> would have been a great philanthropist. He was very altruistic and was the most typical
                    Owen of his generation. He was always courteous, kind, and liked by everyone—a
                    well-rounded character. His wife was Natalie Mann, sister of Della, who married Eugene Owen. Horace
                    Owen had three children, Nora, Aline, and Richard Dale. Nora, born 1868 in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was a strong character, gracious, tactful and politic. She had a common school

            <p>Robert Owen and his sons were prominent in the social, political, educational and scientific life of
                    their time. The biographical and genealogical data of the ancestry and the descendants of such a
                    family then are of interest. In this paper their achievements have been noted. There has also been
                    added something of their personal traits, their temperaments, their likes and dislikes, their
                    ambitions and desires. The noting of these different traits added to the picture of the individual
                    perhaps makes his actions more clear, explains his behavior and interests. The altruism of Robert
                    Owen made him spend a fortune in attempts to better the conditions of his fellow men. This same
                    altruism, love of fellow man in general, devotion to the interests of others, is a trait found in
                    many of the Owen family. The "Owen charm and graciousness of manner," noted in the
                    foregoing description, here and there, is another trait of interest. Robert Owen possessed a keen
                    business sense; it is found in only one of his children and in a few of his later descendants. The
                    Owens in later years have not been wealthy. Music and other arts have found warm friends in many of
                    the family. The Fauntleroys and the Parkes have made a name for themselves in music. Robert <pb n="99" id="VAA4025-019-1-101"/> Dale Owen was a voluminous writer. Several others have been
                    writers of more or less note. Robert Dale Owen was a statesman. Many have been soldiers.</p>
            <p>The reader of a paper of this sort desires not to be wearied by immaterial dates of birth and other
                    like notes. The complete genealogical and biographical data of the Owen family with much that is not
                    noted here, data of material interest, however, are filed in the archives of the Eugenics Record
                    Office at Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The lineage of Robert Owen goes back only to his father, an ironmonger and local official in a small
                    place in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wlk">Wales</region>
                    </placeName>, Newtown. His mother was "superior in mind and manner." It is
                    unfortunate that no more is known of the folk, the blood, that produced Robert Owen, the idealist,
                    educator, reformer and communist. His wife, Ann Caroline Dale, originated from a family in whose
                    veins the best blood of <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName> has flowed, the Argylls and the Breadalbanes. Is it to be wondered at that the children
                    of this pair have ability, charm, interest in art and music? Robert Dale Owen, the son of Robert
                    Owen, was a statesman of America. This same Robert Dale and his daughter were writers. Jane Owen,
                    another child of Robert Owen, was a teacher and married a brilliant young scientist, Robert H.
                    Fauntleroy, and their daughter was Constance Fauntleroy Runcie who made a name for herself as a
                    composer of music and as a writer and organizer. This same musical ability is found in the
                    descendants of David Dale Owen, another son of Robert Owen. David Dale was the geologist and
                    scientist. A writer of no mean ability, though not voluminous, is Caroline Dale Snedeker, of the
                    David branch, The other son of Robert Owen was Richard, a soldier, scientist and later a teacher of
                    natural science at Indiana university.</p>
            <p>The altruism which is found in Robert Owen, and, to a less degree, in David Dale, his father-in-law,
                    is again reproduced in many of his descendants. Robert Dale Owen was an altruist; Rosamond Owen
                    Templeton gave her home for the care of wounded British soldiers during the late war; Julian Owen
                    did for his fellow citizens in a small way, Constance Fauntleroy Runcie was the constant aid of her
                    minister husband, Ellinor Davidson has been a philanthropist so far as her re- <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-019-1-102"/> sources permit, Alfred, son of David, and his three sisters were
                    altruistic in nature, Horace P. Owen was philanthropic and large-hearted and many others had the
                    trait but in a less marked degree.</p>
            <p>The Owen charm and graciousness of manner, so characteristic of the earlier members of the family, is
                    found here and there among the descendants and is quickly recognized and felt by those who have the
                    good fortune to meet it.</p>
            <p>A high grade of intellectual ability is found in Robert Owen and his three genius sons. This same
                    high grade of mental ability is found in others of the family, not in all, it is true, because some
                    of the matings of the Owens have been into strains not as strong as themselves and the offspring
                    have inherited also from the out-blood. Three of the sons of Robert had high-grade mental ability,
                    Robert the statesman, David and Richard the scientists. Others with high intellectual ability were
                    Constance Fauntleroy Runcie, who studied science as well as the arts, Grace Owen Zering, who died in
                    her early twenties, William H. Owen, a student of astronomy, and some others. It is interesting to
                    add here that not a sinble feeble-minded person is found in the Owen family.</p>
            <p>Progress has been made in the technique of the measurement of general mental intelligence. The army
                    intelligence tests and other psychological tests are offering measuring sticks for mental ability.
                    The temperamental traits, however, can not as yet be measured with a yard stick as one measures the
                    height of an individual, but as time goes on, it is probable that the behavior traits in turn will
                    be measured quantitatively just as they now are observed qualitatively. The further study of such
                    families as the Owens, where distinctive traits and behavior, as here, can be observed and reported,
                    with technique of observation continually becoming better, will in time amass a set of information
                    which will show what traits of behavior are inherited, how they are influenced by training and
                    "environment," and what behavior reactions depend alone on the associations of the
                    individual concerned.</p>
            <p>This study of human behavior is here presented to stimulate interest in this type of biographical
                    genealogy. It is also presented to show that certain traits and methods of behavior <pb n="101" id="VAA4025-019-1-103"/> are continually present or reappearing in a family and that a certain
                    high grade of mental ability is characteristic of a group, but not necessarily found in every member
                    of that group. It also shows a group of socially minded, thoughtful people. The Owens have been an
                    aristogenic family and their activities and behavior and traits are therefore of public
                interest.</p>

            <p>The Fourth annual conference on Indiana history held under the auspices of the society of Indiana
                    Pioneers, the Indiana historical society and the Indiana historical commission, was held on December
                    8th and 9th, 1922. From the standpoint of interest and attendance, the Fourth conference was by far
                    the most successful that has yet been held. There were three hundred and forty-two registrations,
                    and perhaps seventy-five or one hundred who did not register, making the total attendance run well
                    over four hundred. Fifty-four of the ninety-two counties were represented. Four hundred and
                    sixty-eight attended the annual pioneer dinner on Saturday evening. Prof. Benjamin F. Shambaugh of
                    the Iowa historical society, Hamlin Garland, author, <placeName>

            <p>The Friday afternoon program was given, over chiefly to a discussion of the problems relating to
                    county and local historical societies. Reports from the committees that were appointed at the
                    preceding conference were given, consisting of a report on School Co-operation by Prof. Herbert

                    of reports from representatives from county historical societies. Professor Shambaugh gave an
                    address on Our Relation to History. His talk was an inspiration to all the historical workers in
                    Indiana; a discussion followed, in which many of the problems of the local societies were
                    considered.</p>
            <p>A special meeting of the Indiana historical society was also held Friday afternoon at which time a
                    memorial tribute was read to the memory of the late Delavan Smith. It will be recalled by readers of
                    this <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> that Mr. Smith left to the Indiana historical society a cash bequest
                    of $150,000 and his valuable private library on Americana.</p>

            <p>That there is a rapidly increasing interest manifested in the study of local history is shown by the
                    number of new county historical societies that are being organized in Indiana. There are today
                    fifty-five county historical societies in the state. Membership in these local societies numbers all
                    the way from twenty-five to thirty in the smaller counties up to more than two hundred in the larger
                    ones. Since the last issue of this <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> societies have been organized in the

            <p>An interesting historical find is described by Mrs. Harriet F. Ferree of Mauckport, Harrison county,
                    as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>On July 9, 1863, when General Morgan crossed the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> into Indiana
                            he set fire to the boat Alice Dean and sank it one hundred yards above Buck creek. Many
                            curiosity seekers have explored this scene for years to obtain relics. Many pieces of
                            timbers from the hull of the boat have been carried away, but nothing of more value has been
                            unearthed until last Sunday, October 8, when Marion and Norval Frank and Virgil Applegate,
                            of Mauckport, visited the scene and unearthed the tool chest of this boat. It contained the
                            following articles: 3 locks, 8 different kinds of hammers, bolt cutters, a die, 5 pairs of
                            smith tongs, one large four-foot wrench, one compass in good condition, 1 square, numerous
                            wedges, one rachet, one brace and bit, a large number of nuts, taps of different kinds, a
                            crowbar, babbet metal, fire bricks, large and small sizes and many other small articles.

                    Offield, presided at the meeting, and told an interesting history of William Offield and his pioneer
                    life. The inscription on the boulder which is now embedded in a concrete base, is very simple and
