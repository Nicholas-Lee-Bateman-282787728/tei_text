            Following the Civil War large numbers of destitute African Americans migrated to Indiana from the
                    South. In late 1869 Friends (Quakers) in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , concerned over the plight of newly arrived African Americans, met with a committee
                    associated with the Freedman's Bureau. Further interest in the subject prompted a committee
                    comprised of representatives from three quarterly meetings, 
                  Plainfield, Fairfield
               , and
                    White Lick, to consult with the 
                        Marion
                     County commissioners and prominent citizens of 
                        Indianapolis
                     to consider various solutions to the problem. Providing aid to helpless, homeless, and
                    dependent African-American children, who seemed particularly vulnerable and weak, was a primary
                    concern. In 1870 
                        Indianapolis
                     Friends won financial assistance and approval from the county commissioners and the
                    Western Yearly Meeting to open the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Asylum for Friendless Colored Children (IAFFCC). These devout Hoosiers maintained the
                    orphanage until 1922 when it was turned over to the 
                        Marion
                     County Board of Commissioners.1 In part as a result of increasing
                    interest in the plight of defenseless children, American reformers founded numerous orphanages in
                    the years following the Civil War. Most of the institutions were sponsored by Protestant
                    denominations, but the Catholic Bureau of Dependent Children

                     was also active, as were several Jewish orphanages and
                    societies. Virtually all of the organizers were amateurs without formal training in child care. Many
                    of the religious organizations were motivated by the desire to correct frightening new urban
                    problems. Migrants from farms, small towns, and Europe caused cities such as 
                        Indianapolis
                     to grow rapidly. The 1870 decennial census listed the population of the Hoosier capital
                    at 48,244 compared to approximately 8,000 in 1850. The African-American population of the city,
                    which before the war numbered only 500, reached almost 3,000 by 1870.2 The
                    disruptive effects of such growth and change seemed to include a breakdown in traditional values and
                        morals.3 Organizations like the IAFFCC desperately sought to provide moral
                    ballast. Its leaders saw religion as a stabilizing force in a rapidly changing society. The
                    alternative, they feared, was a splintered, chaotic community. Friends in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , by answering African-American children's needs through the IAFFCC, hoped to
                    revitalize traditional values, insure social cohesion, and meet a number of more general pressing
                    social needs.4
            
            At the time that Friends in 
                        Indianapolis
                     opened the IAFFCC, American Quakers were in the midst of transition. Throughout their
                    first two hundred years in America, Quakers had been distinguished by their adherence to quietism,
                    plain dress and speech, pacifism, the doctrine of inner light, and a non-pastoral ministry. By 1870,
                    however, Friends, like other religious groups, were being affected by modernizing forces that tended
                    to fragment them. Nineteenth-century American Quakers split first into Orthodox and Hicksite
                    factions; the Orthodox group further separated into Wilburites

                     and Gurneyites. The Orthodox Gurneyites, of which the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Friends were a part, splintered in the 1860s and 1870s into Conservatives, Moderates,
                    and followers of the Holiness movement. By the latter decade the dominant Protestant evangelical and
                    revivalist ethos had permeated Orthodox Quakerism. By the end of the nineteenth century most
                    Orthodox Friends in Indiana had embraced evangelical conversion, a paid ministry, undistinguished
                    dress, vocal prayers and preaching, and reinterpretations of the inner light, placing them much
                    closer to the American Protestant mainstream.5
            
            The Quakers were among the earliest migrants to Indiana, and certain counties in the
                            state—
                  Wayne, Randolph
               , and Henry, for example—had heavy
                    concentrations by the early nineteenth century. The Society of Friends in 
                        Indianapolis
                     grew gradually. The first Friends Meeting in the Hoosier capital organized in
                    September, 1855. By December, 1856, members had completed construction of a one-story building at
                    the triangle of Fort 
                        Wayne
                     Avenue and St. Clair and 
                        Delaware
                     streets. By 1859 the meeting consisted of 57 members; by 1865 the membership had
                    reached 150. Continued growth forced Friends to erect a second building in 1895 at 
                        Alabama
                     and Thirteenth streets. Ten years later, on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the
                    first Friends Meeting, membership in 
                        Indianapolis
                     totaled 950. In the Hoosier capital, as elsewhere in Indiana, most of the resident
                    Quakers had migrated from 
                        North Carolina
                    , Pennsylvania, and other eastern states.6
            
            The Quakers in 
                        Indianapolis
                     had created the IAFFCC to aid dependent African-American children at a time when such
                    benevolence was generally extended only to those who were white. In fact, 
                        Quaker
                     interest in African-American children developed in a time and place in which few whites
                    believed in equality of the races in any respect. Indiana laws in the early nineteenth century

                             had "discarded distinctive dress, and have usually adopted paid
                            ministers, singing, prescribed services, instrumental music, and revival methods."

                     barred African Americans from voting, testifying against whites,
                    and serving in the militia. African Americans were also forbidden to marry whites and to attend
                    public schools. Article XIII of the state Constitution of 1851, although never strictly enforced,
                    prohibited free African Americans from settling in the state. After the Civil War political,
                    economic, and social prejudice continued. Although African Americans were permitted to vote, they
                    failed to gain significant political power. African Americans also often labored in menial
                    occupations. Denied access to jobs, education, and charity services, African-American families often
                    struggled desperately to provide for their children. By the end of the nineteenth century racial
                    antipathy sometimes turned to hatred that brought violence and lynchings.7
            
            It was against this backdrop that 
                        Indianapolis
                     Quakers opened the IAFFCC. No other white church in the nineteenth century showed more
                    concern for the welfare of African Americans than American Quakers, who often combined altruism,
                    benevolence, and a sense of social responsibility to lead the nation in the promotion of social
                        reform.8 This sense of charity carried over to dependent African-American
                    children. In a society that aided only white orphans, Quakers had been among the first to provide
                    relief to African-American "waifs." The 
                        Philadelphia
                     Association for the Care of Colored Children opened in 1822. A decade later Friends
                    started orphanages in 
                  Providence, Rhode Island
               , and 
                        New York
                     City. Because of displacement produced by the Civil War, the Society of Friends also
                    started orphanages for African Americans in Helena and 
                  Little
                            Rock, Arkansas
               , and in
                    Lauderdale, 
                        Mississippi
                    .9 The IAFFCC was thus one of only a handful of orphanages for
                    African Americans in the nation.
            The IAFFCC, as the sole orphanage of its kind in the state, represented a pioneer effort in Indiana.
                    As was generally true elsewhere in the country, Indiana's laws regarding dependent and
                    neglected children developed piecemeal. Indiana's first response to the needs of dependent
                    children was to adopt the Elizabethan poor laws in 1807. At the core of these poor laws was the
                    indenture system, which bound children as apprentices to families and individuals

                     to work for a given length of time. Overseers, representing
                    specific counties and appointed by the courts, monitored the treatment of the youngsters. The laws
                    required masters to provide education and some wages and prohibited cruel treatment or neglect.
                    Later amendments, however, made education for African-American apprentices optional and up to the
                    discretion of the overseers.10
            
            When Indiana became a state in 1816, framers of the constitution provided for a poor asylum for all
                    indigent whites.11 The first attempt to fulfill the provision came in 1821 when 
                        Knox
                     County built a facility for the poor. A general law, permitting each county to build an
                    asylum, was passed in 1831.12 Over a decade later the first orphanage
                    exclusively for dependent children opened in 
                        South Bend
                    . The state authorized the 
                        St. Joseph
                     Orphan Asylum as a private, sectarian institution run by Catholics to receive orphans.
                    The governor appointed individuals to inspect the institution and to make reports to the next
                        legislature.13
            
            Direct government involvement in the asylums represented a significant departure. Dependent children
                    were no longer under the care of overseers but were now under state supervision.14 Unfortunately, fragmented records make it difficult to estimate the number of orphanages
                    that appeared in the period before 1870. The available evidence suggests that very few existed and
                    that most dependent children remained in almshouses. It was not until passage of an act in 1881,
                    which authorized county commissioners to purchase more asylums, that orphanages became more
                    widespread in the state.15 The IAFFCC was unique not only because its sole
                    purpose was to aid African-American children but also because it was one of Indiana's first
                    orphanages.
            Friends completed construction of the IAFFCC in early 1870. The simple brick house, built according
                    to the congregate plan, was located at 317 West Twenty-First Street.16 The home
                    was built on six lots, one-half of which had been donated by Gustavus Shurman

                            congregate plan. Children usually ate, slept, played, worked, and learned in a single
                            building. Rarely was there much interaction between the institution and the local
                        community.
               
                     and the other half which had been purchased from him. Friends
                    quickly found burdensome the challenge of caring for children in the original building design. At
                    normal capacity the home was never capable of housing more than one hundred children, but it often
                    exceeded those limits.17 Numerous additions to the home attempted to meet
                    changing needs. There were separate dormitories for girls and boys and a nursery for infants. Over
                    the years the remainder of the home included playrooms, dining room, receiving room for guests,
                    laundry, kitchen, and a small hospital. Two small schools were built a short distance away from the
                    main building. Except for 1889, when children were temporarily removed to outside families following
                    an Easter Sunday fire in one of the wings, the IAFFCC housed children at the same location
                    throughout its existence.18
            
            The Quakers ran the orphanage through a Board of Women Managers, whose president also served as
                    director of the asylum. Only two different presidents directed the Board during the
                    orphanage's tenure under the Quakers. Jane Trueblood, a minister in the Friends church,
                    served as president from its inception until her death on August 8, 1891. Following a brief interim,
                    Alice R. Taylor succeeded Trueblood and managed the home until 
                        Marion
                     County assumed control.19 The board generally met once a month to
                    discuss the needs of the institution. The organization of the asylum was pyramidal. The president
                    appointed an executive committee from among the managers. The executive committee consisted of the
                    president, two vice-presidents, a secretary, and a treasurer. The executive committee then received
                    assistance from clothing, educational, visiting, and other committees. The various committees were
                    charged with obtaining supplies and materials. In the case of the visiting committee, one officer
                    and two board members were appointed to visit the home each week to transact business and inspect
                        conditions.20
            
            In addition to the Board of Women Managers, a Board of Directors, made up of nine male Quakers,
                    oversaw the financial affairs of the orphanage. According to their synoptic view of life, men
                    presided over the world of material affairs while women tended the domestic sphere of hearth and
                        home.21 The orphanage received

                     funds from both private donations and support from county
                    governments. It appears likely, although the evidence is not conclusive, that the IAFFCC was the
                    recipient of a large donation from an individual named John Williams. An African-American pioneer
                    from 
                        North Carolina
                    , Williams settled in 
                        Washington County
                    , near a 
                        Quaker
                     community. Unlike most African-American Hoosiers he made a substantial living as a
                    farmer and a tanner. Williams was murdered in December, 1864, an innocent victim of racial hatred.
                    Before his untimely death he had made provisions to donate his estate to furthering the education of
                    African Americans in Indiana. His executor, William Lindley, or someone else, turned the proceeds of
                    the estate, amounting to $5,750, over to the IAFFCC in 1870.22

            Monthly reports of the IAFFCC commonly listed other donations of food, clothing, money, and time from

                    , for example, furnished free subscriptions to such magazines as The
                        National SS Teacher, Scholars' Weekly, the Little Folks, and the
                        Indiana Farmer. Twice each year, in addition, the Indiana Farmer
                    advertised to find prospective homes for the children. Merchants from around 
                        Indianapolis
                     also contributed goods and services. Bobbs Dispensary, for instance, generously
                    provided medicines, and the local newspapers offered advertising space for the home.24
            
            Although this sporadic aid helped to meet daily needs, the primary financial support for the IAFFCC
                    came from the 
                        Marion
                     County commissioners who had provided $1,500 to establish the orphanage and
                    who agreed to pay a per diem rate for each child in the asylum. When the IAFFCC opened, the rate was
                    25 cents a day per child; this later increased to 75 cents. These payments, made promptly on a
                    quarterly basis, allowed the orphanage to survive.25
            
            Shortly after its inauguration the orphanage agreed to accept children from outside 
                        Marion
                     County. Although most of the children came from the 
                        Indianapolis
                     area, records suggest that in the period from 1899 to 1922 at least thirty-five
                    counties from within the state sent children to the IAFFCC. Often officials in other counties found
                    it more convenient to send their dependent African-American children to the IAFFCC than to care for
                    them at home. Each of these counties also agreed to pay the per diem rate.26
            
            Although public financial support was essential, the 
                        Quaker
                     women actively involved with the home carried the burden for its survival. Indiana 
                        Quaker
                     women were similar to other middle-class Protestant women reformers in post-Civil War
                    America. In a world of uncertainty, they saw motherhood and home as symbols of stability. The ideal
                    of domesticity not only placed women on a moral pedestal, but it also helped raise the status of
                        children.27

            More than any other individual connected with the IAFFCC, the matron of the home was responsible for
                    the arduous task of day to day operations. She was aided by a staff that included two governesses
                    (one supervised the boys and the other the girls), two nurses, seamstress, teacher, cook, laundress,
                    and an assistant.28 Several of the staff lived separately in a house across the
                        street.29 Despite this assistance the matron's duties presented
                    endless new challenges and paid little. Her job was so demanding few lasted more than several
                        months.30
            
            The staffs work load increased dramatically during the institution's frequent epidemics.
                    Whooping cough, scarlet fever, mumps, measles, smallpox, and diphtheria flourished in the large open
                    air dormitories.31 The home initially employed a doctor who was on call as
                    needed; later the American County Medical Society provided free services. The staff tried to prevent
                    epidemics by thoroughly screening new children for contagious diseases, but this procedure often met
                    with little success.32 Death tolls reached their highest point during periods of
                    epidemics, which resulted in more deaths for children under five years of age.33
                    Those who died received a religious service and were buried in lots donated at Crown
                    Hill Cemetery and 
                        Brown
                     Hill.34
            
            The IAFFCC accepted dependents up to age fourteen. A few more than half of those admitted were boys.
                    At the end of the home's first year of operation it had housed eighteen children; by the
                    1890s the number reached over 170 annually.35 From the

                            1887 to 1909, the home averaged ten deaths per year, while housing 109 children yearly.
                            During this period 67 percent of those who died were four years old or younger. (Figures
                            were not kept for 1903.) Beginning after 1897 new state laws required the institution to

                     IAFFCC's inception until 1909 the home averaged 109
                        annually.36 The children entered the home for a variety of reasons. Many had
                    been assigned by courts, which made vague distinctions among dependent, neglected, and delinquent
                    children. The categories mattered little to the managers. They saw their function as offering
                    protection and shelter to any African-American child in need.
            Managers identified orphans, half-orphans, and victims of unstable home environments as dependent
                    children. In fact, most of the children were not orphans in the true sense of the word. Often, on
                    the death of one parent the surviving parent was not able to care for the child. Some parents would
                    board the child in the home certain months of the year. Surviving relatives paid a small fee to help
                    support the child. Boarding children for small payments from family members typified institutions
                    across the country. Not all residents of the IAFFCC needed placement in individual homes. Many of
                    the children were motherless or fatherless in the sense that their parents were simply not able to
                    provide. African-American families in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , frequently propertyless and consigned to low paying jobs, often had little choice. The
                    home simply helped such families get through difficult times. Throughout the year many of these
                    children returned to relatives or friends. The home also cared for many true orphans and also for
                    abandoned children. Some of these were victims of abusive and irresponsible parents. After the
                    IAFFCC had succeeded in rescuing these children, it faced the difficult task of finding homes for
                    them.
            The board did not envision long periods of care for many of its charges but rather hoped to dispatch
                    them to apprenticeships, adoptions, or relatives. A few of the youngsters suffered from mental or
                    physical liabilities that made them unacceptable for outside placement. Frequently, however, board
                    members complained of the difficulties in finding adoptive homes even for healthy African-American
                    children. Few families seemed interested in adopting the youngsters, and most children left the home
                    only when they became old enough for indentured work.37 Board members thought of
                    indenture as a method to support and prepare children to become working adults and responsible
                    citizens. The apprenticeship contract defined the legal relationship between master and in some
                    detail the child. Often the master agreed to provide clothing, lodging, education, and food for the
                    apprentice. Board members hoped the child's experience would include religious as well as
                    vocational training.38

            Board members attempted to guard against the exploitation of adoptable and indentured children by
                    placing them into "good Christian homes." Of course, at times, it was difficult to
                    prevent abuses. Records show pathetic examples of irresponsibility and cruelty. One such example
                    involved a girl who was not yet eight years old. Late one evening she returned to the asylum wearing
                    a blouse saturated with her blood. She had been the victim of a brutal whipping from a ruthless
                    master. Although an investigation revealed that numerous whippings had taken place over an extended
                    period of time, the mayor pardoned the accused, and the court forced the girl to pay a
                    $10 fine and court costs39
            
            The 
                        Quaker
                     belief that an ordered life was a moral, pious life dictated the Friends'
                    exercise of power over dependent children.40 The board argued that many of the
                    children in the home could become "burdens to society," hence measures were needed
                    to prevent "crime and pauperism."41 Friends believed that a
                    Christian life involved structure and discipline. Like managers of other orphanages of the period,
                    Friends valued a strict and orderly daily routine. In that sense, one of the IAFFCC's
                    functions was directed toward societal order. Its purpose, in short, was to prepare children for
                    adulthood by instilling self-discipline and a sense of individual responsibility.
            The IAFFCC's attempt to order the make up of the children's lives, however, was not
                    simply another means to support the existing class system and thereby perpetuate inequality.
                    Instead, the institution sought the opposite. Friends intended to "instruct" and
                    "elevate this class."42 The orphanage never intended to
                    sacrifice individuality for inflexible routines. Regularity and orderliness were simply a means to
                    improve the character of the child. Underlying such routines were a deep sense of compassion and a
                    sensitivity to the needs of the children.
            The IAFFCC's house rules had a simple purpose: to "inculcate a strict regard to
                    cleanliness, order, and economy."43 The children

                     40 Various theories of social control have been promoted to explain
                            the motivations of reformers and their methods of control over lower classes. Recent
                            scholarship has demonstrated that social control theory, as an interpretative strategy for
                            reform and institutions, can be ambiguous and suffer from serious inadequacies. For two

                     were awakened at 5:30 a.m. every morning, and they immediately
                    washed and dressed. Meals during the day followed the same rigid schedule; breakfast was at 7:00
                    a.m., lunch at 12:00 p.m., and dinner at 5:30 p.m. The children were to proceed to and from meals in
                    an orderly fashion, remaining quiet before, during, and after. By 6:30 p.m. they were to be in their
                    dormitories for religious devotional exercises conducted by a matron or the governess. At the
                    conclusion of the exercises the children were to go to sleep. The older children were to insure that
                    the younger ones followed the rules.44
            
            Strict order and routine, of course, necessitated discipline. Unrelenting supervision brought mild,
                    but certain, punishment for any infraction of the rules. Friends desired that all corrective
                    measures fit the nature of the offense and disposition of the child. The matron, unless she
                    delegated to others, was the only person with the authority to inflict punishment on a child. If
                    disciplinary methods proved ineffective, however, the president could resort to expulsion.45 Discipline, according to board members, was more effective when based on
                    persuasion and moral influence. Fear may have been an underlying motive for corrective child
                    behavior, but the ostensible reason was a religious one.
            Religion, board members thought, served to mold the children into worthy individuals. The best way to
                    create good Christians was to control the youngsters' spiritual environment.46 The matron assured that one-half of every day was devoted to scripture exercises. Each
                    child received and recited new verses each week. Board members took great pride in reporting the
                    number of scriptures memorized each year. In 1884, for instance, they reported with great joy that
                    3,000 scriptures had been memorized. They were disappointed to learn, however, that it was
                    unproductive to try to teach scripture passages to infants in the nursery. Aside from the scripture
                    exercises, religious services were held every Sabbath.47 The Sabbath services
                    were conducted by either the matron, governesses, or outside individuals. Frequently, individuals
                    from local African-American churches presided over Sunday school.48
            
            Quakers also emphasized the need to obtain a secular education to shape children's
                    characters and prepare them for responsible lives. Education inculcated respect for authority and
                    offered solutions to some of the fundamental problems of the time.49 Quakers

                     also hoped that education would provide African-American
                    children an equal opportunity to compete in society. A day school opened in 1886. Throughout most of
                    its existence the school was supervised by the 
                        Indianapolis
                     public school system. A single teacher taught the school at least three hours a day,
                    six days a week. Legislation enacted in 1899 required all children from ages six to fourteen years
                    of age to attend classes.50 All children studied reading, writing, arithmetic,
                    and elementary geography. The school was coeducational, but as in other areas of the home
                    interaction between sexes was strictly controlled. The IAFFCC had hoped to build a manual training
                    school, but it was never completed. Outside of school hours the girls were taught domestic skills
                    and the boys manual labor.51 The home proudly announced in 1921 that five
                    students had graduated from the school and gone on to college.52
            
            The children were occasionally provided some reprieve from the monotonous daily routine. Guests were
                    permitted daily, except Saturday and Sunday, between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Family
                    members or friends were limited to two visits a month unless the board approved additional visits
                    because of unusual circumstances. Additionally, the IAFFCC staff tried to take the children on
                    occasional picnics.53 Perhaps the happiest moments for the youngsters were the
                    holidays, particularly Thanksgiving and Christmas. Local donors provided turkey, ham, candy, and
                    toys. Sometimes special dinners and programs were held in their honor. One Christmas the home
                    accepted invitations from the Harmony Club, Elks, and Colored Shriners. The board of managers agreed
                    to purchase new clothing for the children to make sure they were properly attired to attend the
                        events.54
            
            In an attempt to convey a sense of the human quality of the institution, managers consistently
                    referred to all residents as members of the "family." Monthly meetings of the
                    board often reported with deep satisfaction the acceptance of their children into new families.55 Monthly reports also provide evidence that the institution successfully
                    established close ties between some children and the orphanage. The board in one meeting recorded
                    the gift of a Bible from one of their former charges. The boy had been given the Bible as a present
                    from the home before leaving to go to a family,

            Near the turn of the century the dynamic burst of reform associated with the progressive movement
                    included numerous campaigns to reconcile modern industrialization, urbanization, and ethnic
                    diversity. Progressives sought to battle inequities and injustices and to confront social problems.
                    Dependent children became one of their prime targets.57 During the progressive
                    era Congress created the 
                        United States
                     Children's Bureau to investigate and report on all issues regarding child
                    welfare. Sudden fascination with the needs of children produced juvenile courts, child labor laws,
                    compulsory school attendance laws, child-aid societies, and the playground movement.58 Much of the legislation of child-care reform came at the state and local levels. In the
                    late 1800s several types of state systems developed. 
                        Michigan
                     set a significant precedent in 1874 by creating a state public school to which probate
                    courts temporarily assigned children as wards of the state. By 1900 nine other states, including
                    Indiana, had adopted modified versions of the 
                        Michigan
                     plan. Reforms in the Indiana child welfare system began in 1897 when a
                    children's division of the State Board of Charities was authorized to investigate
                    orphanages and report its findings. Perhaps more importantly, dependent children in Indiana became
                    legal wards of the state. In 1907 the child welfare laws were further reformed to invest juvenile
                    courts with the sole authority to declare dependent children public wards. Orphanages were to
                    function only as temporary receiving centers until state agents could find homes for youngsters.59
            
            Many progressive reformers wanted to close outdated, cold, and sterile institutions. Congregate
                    asylums, such as the IAFFCC, fell into disfavor as critics contended that children in these homes
                    were denied a healthy, secure home environment. By the turn of the century "child
                    savers" tended to promote sending children into

                            After the legislation passed in 1897, numerous orphanages were closed down, and the IAFFCC
                            noted a decrease in the number of children they admitted. Board Reports, March 14, 1899, p.
                            186; March 14, 1901, p. 219.
               
                     foster homes, and asylums such as the IAFFCC were on the
                    defensive. The difficult task of finding such homes for African-American children, however, suggests
                    the limited vision of white reformers.
            The idea of substituting foster families for institutional settings was not new. During the latter
                    half of the nineteenth century, Charles Loring Brace's well-known "orphan
                    trains" carried thousands of 
                        New York
                     children to rural homes largely in the Midwest. Other societies adopted the technique
                    and sent children westward.60 Still other innovative approaches included forms
                    of self-government, farm schools, and the "cottage home" system.61 Many progressive reformers believed in the power of the press to awaken and enlighten the
                    public about the needs of homeless children. National campaigns were highly critical of traditional
                    orphan asylums, and by the early twentieth century public sentiment had clearly shifted toward the
                    foster care system.62
            
            Perhaps critics of the IAFFCC and other similar homes were correct. Although these large congregate
                    institutions once filled a void in child care, the decaying buildings and crowded conditions
                    severely limited what well-meaning matrons and board members could accomplish. In 1918 a report of
                    the 
                        New York
                     Bureau of Research outlined the problems. The bureau's inspection commission
                    criticized the IAFFCC for its unsafe and overcrowded conditions, pointing particularly to inadequate
                    fire protection measures, medical care, play space, and sleeping quarters. The rooms for the
                    children were "dark and foreboding" and "unpleasant in every
                    particular." The board admitted that thirty-six boys slept in a room less than twenty feet
                        square.63 The report of 1918 noted other problems. In one corner of the
                    nursery the inspection commission team found a "mentally defective epileptic
                    child" enclosed in a wire cage. It was the only way that the staff could keep him from
                    "annoying the others," the matron noted. The 
                        New York
                     investigators suggested that the child be removed to a facility where he could receive
                    adequate care. The report did, however, compliment the staff of IAFFCC for the cleanliness of the
                    home and their efforts with limited resources and for being the only institution of its kind in the
                        state.64

            As the report indicated, the space needs had outgrown the home's original site. Once located
                    in an undeveloped area in the countryside, the IAFFCC had become encircled by the rapid growth of
                    the city. Neighbors, angry at having the home in their neighborhood, also protested it should be
                        moved.65 The 
                        New York
                     bureau agreed and recommended that 
                        Marion
                     County take over the orphanage and build a new home.
            In response, the IAFFCC conceded that the state had more resources to operate the home. The Board of
                    Women Managers formally requested that public officials assume control. In 1922 the recommendation
                    was accepted, and the 
                        Marion
                     County Board of Commissioners took charge. The money left in the asylum's
                    budget, $4,304.22, became the basis for a still-existing Friends scholarship fund for
                    African-American students. The county commissioners operated the home until 1939 when the 
                        Marion
                     County Welfare Department took it over and cleared the home of children within a year.
                    It closed a few years later.66
            
            By 1922, on the eve of its fifty-second anniversary, the IAFFCC took great pride in the fact that it
                    had housed more than three thousand children. Throughout its existence 
                        Quaker
                     managers labored long and diligently to establish what they hoped would be a better
                    world for African-American children. The desire to make a turbulent world orderly, the extended role
                    of women managers, and strong benevolent instincts helped define the nature of their child rescue
                    work. Humanitarian zeal, fostered by the belief that all children were sacred, special, and part of
                    an extended family, led Quakers to aid African-American children when such support was not
                        common.67
            
            As progressive critics charged, however, traditional homes like the IAFFCC had become outdated by the
                    early twentieth century. Just as its energies and efforts reflect early reform work in the Victorian
                    era, so did its decline conform to patterns in the waning years of progressivism. In many respects
                    the progressive critics were right, but in light of the problems of the foster-care system the
                    virtues and failings of noninstitutional and institutional care continue to be debated.
            The weaknesses of the IAFFCC should not overshadow what the home accomplished. If one measures the
                    success of the IAFFCC by the intentions and the void it served, then the institution was a great
                    success. Motivated by a sense of social justice, Friends in

                     established the IAFFCC for homeless black children denied

                    apathetic to African Americans is a testimony to their achievements. The IAFFCC stands as a unique,
                    pioneering effort and represents one of the era's finest accomplishments.

                    1812

            The War of 1812 spilled bloodily across the Old Northwest, bringing American military success and
                        failure.1 Many of the works written about the campaigns against the British
                    and their Indian allies focus on the larger picture and on the military and political leaders. There
                    are only a few good accounts by the participants themselves, particularly by those who served as
                    rank and file militiamen. John Jackson's memoir of his militia service in 1812 and 1813
                    provides a rare and fascinating window into the daily life of an ordinary soldier. Jackson reminds
                    readers, for example, of the importance of food for men at war, as he describes roasting potatoes
                    over a fire and eating too much corn. He tells of the diversions necessary to pass long, uneventful
                    days and of the challenges of breaking through ice on a hard winter march. All this Jackson later
                    remembered and wrote in a straightforward manner, without false embellishment or pride and in a
                    voice that rings true and clear to later generations.
            Jackson was born on July 2, 1790, in Hardy County, 
                        Virginia
                     (now West 
                        Virginia
                    ). At the age of nine he moved west with his parents to 
                        Chillicothe
                    , Ross County, 
                        Ohio
                    , where he married in 1811.2 The following year, as war with Great
                    Britain was declared, Jackson embarked on his career with the 
                        Ohio
                     militia.

            Tracing Jackson's military service through extant 
                        Ohio
                     muster rolls for 1812 is difficult. Jackson's first enlistment was certainly
                    as a lieutenant in Captain Philip McNemar's company, 
                        Ohio
                     militia, from August 14 or 15, 1812, to February 14 or 15, 1813.3
                    State muster rolls indicate that he served only until October, 1812, but Jackson's pension
                    file clearly shows service through the beginning of the following year. His final enlistment was as
                    captain in his own Ross County company from July 24 or 28 to August 12 or 15, 1813, again depending
                    on whether the pension records or 
                        Ohio
                     records are consulted.4
            
            Jackson served through some of the most exciting and difficult months of the War of 1812. At the time
                    of his enlistment a large American army at 
                        Detroit
                     was under siege by British and Indian forces and soon surrendered. Likewise, the
                    capitulation or evacuation of American posts at Mackinac and 
                        Chicago
                     also resulted in disasters for American arms. The 
                        United States
                     post at Fort 
                        Wayne
                     was one of the few garrisons left, and quickly that small force found itself surrounded
                    by Britain's Indian allies. By the end of 1812, thanks to the small regular army and
                    thousands of militia volunteers like Jackson, the situation improved markedly for the Americans.
                    General William Henry Harrison led an army, of which Jackson was a member, to lift the siege of Fort 
                        Wayne
                     and

                     destroy the surrounding Indian villages. There followed a long
                    period of relative inactivity as Harrison gathered his forces and built Fort Meigs in northwest 
                        Ohio
                     in preparation to retake 
                        Detroit
                     and invade Upper 
                        Canada
                    . During the winter Jackson and his fellow militiamen endured months of camp life in a
                    separate area, punctuated by a small skirmish with the British and Indians. By the time they
                    rejoined Harrison's main force in early 1813, their enlistments had expired, and they went
                    home only weeks before Harrison's force came under siege at Fort Meigs. Later, when the
                    fort came under attack a second time, Jackson once more returned to the army but was too late to
                    take part in any fighting.
            Following the war Jackson remained in Ross County until 1829, when he moved to southeastern 
                        Elkhart County
                    , Indiana, as one of its first white residents. He quickly became a leader in his new
                    home, helping to organize the county and establish 
                        Goshen
                     as the county seat. He was one of several investors who advanced funds to start the 
                        Goshen
                    
                    Democrat, one of the first newspapers in the area. In addition, Jackson served as
                    justice of the peace (1830 and 1840), representative in the Indiana House on two occasions
                    (1836–1837 and 1842–1843), postmaster (1830–1835), county
                    commissioner (1831–1832), and colonel in the Indiana militia. His only major political
                    setback occurred when he was defeated for a third term as state representative in 1850. By the 1870s
                    Jackson had few responsibilities and wrote stories and memoirs for the local paper while reflecting

                    Democrat in seven installments from January 10 to April 17, 1872. His desire to
                    record his personal history has provided later generations an entertaining and highly valuable look
                    into the life of one of the soldiers who followed "Old Tip-pecanoe." His writings
                    give personal views of little known events and details of life in the American militia from
                    descriptions of living conditions to stories of officers and enlisted men and impressions of a first
                    taste of battle. When read with accounts of life in the regular 
                        United States
                     army of this period, the contrast becomes readily apparent. Although, by and large, the
                    militiamen seemed less "military," less disciplined and trained than the regulars,
                    often they experienced many of the same hardships and adventures, showed the same bravado, and
                    shared similar feelings about home and the war.

            Mr. Editor:—I have been requested to write a short sketch of the part I had taken, and
                    some of the incidents that transpired, in the War of 1812. If you should see fit to publish this, I
                    may resume the narrative in another communication. Yours Respectfully, John Jackson.
            At the commencement of the war, I resided in Ross county, 
                        Ohio
                    . In August, 1812, there was a demand for troops to reinforce General Hull's
                    army that was then at or near 
                        Detroit
                    .21 was then a lieutenant in a rifle company in the 
                        Ohio
                     militia. The whole company was ordered out together.3 We
                    rendezvoused at 
                        Urbana
                    , which was the headquarters of the troops being then raised. Governor Meigs and the
                    Adjutant General of 
                        Ohio
                     were there, receiving and organizing the militia as they came in.4
                    Whilst we were laying there, an express came from Fort 
                        Wayne
                     to the Governor, informing him that the fort was besieged by Indians; that the
                    inhabitants had all fled into the fort, and that they were likely to be starved out. Our company was
                    a rifle company, and was armed with their own rifles, and each had a tomahawk and large knife
                    attached to their belts; was uniformed with blue linsey pants and hunting shirts. The
                    officers' hunting shirts (for distinction) was fringed with red. We made a respectable
                    appearance when on parade. The Governor came to our captain and inquired whether our company would
                    be willing to go to Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , provided he would furnish us with horses to ride. The company cheerfully agreed to go.
                    The next day about noon we were mounted on U.S. horses and pack saddles, with our knapsacks and
                    blankets thrown over our saddles, we made a pretty grand show in the streets of 
                        Urbana
                    . We went to Piqua where we met three volunteer mounted companies. We organized a
                    battalion, and elected an old man by the name of

                            John Jackson's account is presented here much as it originally appeared, with only
                            minor changes. Jackson's narrative of his experiences in the War of 1812 was
                            published in the 
                                Goshen
                            
                            Democrat in seven installments from January 10 to April 17, 1872. Jackson
                            addressed an introduction and closing to the 
                                Goshen
                            
                            Democrat editor with each installment. The first preamble and closing is
                            included in the reproduction; all others are represented with an ellipsis of six dots.
                            Spelling, grammar, and syntax have been transcribed exactly as written. Small portions of
                            two issues of the Democrat were damaged, so the editor was compelled to
                            piece together certain sentences. In these passages brackets appear around words which are
                            conjectural. Errors that were clearly attributable to the Democrat's printing process were corrected.

                     3 On August 15, 1812, McNemar's company left Pickaway County
                            with seventy-five riflemen for 
                                Urbana
                            . Later this company was referred to as the "Deer Creek

                     Adams to command. He lived somewhere in the Miami Valley; had
                    been in some skirmishes with Indians and was said to be a good soldier. We then went on to
                    "Shanescroping," and the next day was joined by four other companies from
                    different parts of 
                        Ohio
                    . We there formed a regiment of two battalions. General Lytle,5 of 
                        Cincinnati
                    , was appointed to command the first, Colonel Dunlap,6 of 
                        Chillicothe
                    , the second battalion, and Colonel Adams7 to command the
                        regiment.8 We then marched to Wilshire. At that place we heard that General
                    Harrison was marching a military force from 
                        Kentucky
                     to join Hull's army at 
                        Detroit
                    , and concluded to go via Fort 
                        Wayne
                    .9 He was expected here in two or three days, the officers were
                    called together in counsel, to decide whether to march on to Fort 
                        Wayne
                     immediately, or wait till General Harrison came on. There was two notable characters
                    with us. Both had been in Indian wars, and both had been taken prisoner by them. The one was old
                    General Simon Kenton,10 the other was Stephen Ruddell.11 The
                    officers were some what divided about whether to stay or go on. Ken-ton advised to stay, and Ruddell
                    was for pushing on. The conclusion was to stay until Harrison came on. When the decision was made
                    known, Ruddell got in a great rage, and said they were a set of damned cowards. He drew one of his
                    pistols and we expected there would be blood shed, but some of his friends got him pacified. At this
                    point I will state that Logan, the great Indian chief, was with us.12 He was
                    acquainted with Colonel Dunlap (our Major) and as Colonel Dunlap stayed mostly with our company, I

                            there they formed the battalion.

                     got acquainted with Logan. He told us there,
                    that he could not go any further with us, and his reason was this: he said he was an Indian, and the
                    war would not last always, and after peace was made he would still be with the Indians, and if they
                    knew that he fought against them they never would be friendly towards him. He was a fine, sensible
                    man, and I was sorry to hear how he was foolishly murdered.

                        Wayne

                    mostly all night.13 The Indians found that we were "too much
                    melish," and the next morning they scampered off in all directions. We marched in the next
                    morning, and found them all fled. And some of the incidents that transpired, in the War of 1812;
                    also circumstances that transpired in the first settlement of

            On our arrival at Fort 
                        Wayne
                     we found the place in a deplorable situation—the inhabitants that had
                    settled promiscuously around, had all fled within the Fort. There were some small improvements, and
                    they had raised some grain. Their cabins were all burnt, likewise most of their fences, also their
                    grist mill had been burned. Their horses were all stolen; their cattle and hogs all killed or driven
                    off; and everything that could be, was destroyed. The Fort consisted of four log long cabins built
                    in a square and picketed in all around. They had been closely besieged for a number of days; had got
                    nearly out of firewood, when one foggy morning a party was sent out with guns and axes to procure
                    some wood. This party was discovered by Indians, and had to retreat, being fired on and two men
                    killed before they reached the Fort. The Indians did not venture up to scalp them, and they were
                    taken into the Fort and placed in rough boxes, and in the evening taken out and buried with the
                    honors of war.14 These were the first soldiers we saw buried.—We
                    encamped that night in a hollow square around the Fort. Sometime after dark, one of the sentinels on
                    guard, down the river (Maumee,) reported that he saw Indians crossing the river below on our side,
                    and the officer on guard sent into camp for reinforcements. I was sent with about twenty men.

                     We doubled the line of sentinels and gave strict orders to
                    watch diligently, but no discoveries were made on that line during the night.15
                    The next day General Harrison sent off three attachments in pursuit of the Indians, two of which
                    went to Indian towns on the

                    Run. Our horses having been taken from us at the Fort, we were now on foot, and marched on until the
                    second night afterwards, encamping on Perry's Prarie.19 The following
                    day we came to

                        Benton

                    on and surrounded the town, but found "no-body at home." All had fled that
                    morning. The fires still burned in their wigwams, in one of which was a kettle of pumpkin or
                    squashes, boiled soft, which we supposed to be poisoned, and no one dare eat of it. They had a

                            divided into left and right wings in order to surprise an Indian village there. Some Indians
                            fled from the village, so the Americans reunited their column and gave chase. The pursuit
                            lasted until they were near Five Medals' village, the army's target, when
                            a truce of some sort was arranged, undoubtedly to prevent the Indians from giving warning to
                            Five Medals of the Americans' approach.

                     quantity of corn (for Indians), some of which was found buried,
                    some hung up to dry, and a quantity on the stalk. They had also a quantity of potatoes, pumpkins and
                    squashes. Most all of their valuable property had been taken away. Col. Wells ordered the wigwams to
                    be set on fire, and in a few minutes they were all in flames. Our provision being likely to become
                    scarce, as we had nothing along except what was in our knapsacks, which had become very light, the
                    men were ordered to take as much potatoes and corn as they could carry. We then marched back to 
                        Elkhart
                     Prarie, and encamped. This was on the 11th day of September, 1812, lacking only a few
                    months of 60 years, since I first saw Elk-hart Prarie.22 Some sport was made
                    that night trying to roast potatoes. Every person knows that it requires hot ashes and coals, which
                    we had not, and the method that some undertook was to put down leaves and dirt, and then build a
                    fire over them. When it was thought they were roasted, they were taken out, and the skin found burnt
                    as black as a coal and the inside as raw as it ever was, and after having a good laugh over it, we
                    went to parching corn for our supper. The next morning we could roast our potatoes right. We started
                    in the morning and made a hard days march to Blue river, and that night one of the men died with
                    cholic, having eaten too much corn.23 In the morning he was wrapped in his
                    blanket and laid beside a log, and covered with chunks and poles, after which we continued our march
                    to Fort 
                        Wayne
                     and arrived there in the afternoon, pretty well fatigued. We had no Rail Roads then,
                    and had to put down flatly, every mile that we travelled.—The other attachments that was
                    sent after the Indians, met with the same success that we had, they found none at home.
            When we returned to Fort 
                        Wayne

                        Ohio

                        Wayne
                    . Our company was under different circumstances, we were mustered into the U.S. service
                    for six months. I was sent by our Captain to General Harrison to state our circumstances, and ask
                    what we should do? He said that we must go back to 
                        Urbana
                     and take our place in General Tupper's Brigade, and he gave us an order to
                    draw rations on the route.24 The next morning we put [out] for 
                        Urbana
                     and took our position in the brigade.

                        large town) at 2:00 p.m. He is slightly in error about the date, however. The Americans left

                  24 Edward Tupper (1771–1823) was a brigadier general in the 
                            Ohio
                         militia. He organized a militia brigade consisting of three regiments from southern 
                            Ohio
                         counties in July and August, 1812, rendezvoused them at 
                            Urbana
                        , and led them through the early months of 1813.
            
            
            The men were anxious to go home, and Capt. McNemar went to General Tupper, who gave the whole company
                    a furlough for two weeks. We left our arms and accoutrements with the Quartermaster, and took our
                    clothes in our knapsacks in order to have them washed at home, and started for our homes. Towards
                    evening we agreed to scatter groups, and not too many stop at one house. We were received very
                    kindly by the inhabitants, and treated as well as it was in their power to do. We all arrived safely
                    at our homes. The men that had families to enjoy the privlege of being with them, and the young men
                    with their sweethearts, and all enjoyed themselves well, until it was time for us to start back. We
                    did not go back in a body, a number being conveyed a considerable part of the way by their friends,
                    in buggies and on horseback. Several of the men hired substitutes; they could readily be had for
                    from 40 to 60 dollars. When we got to 
                        Urbana
                     General Tupper's Brigade had been ordered to march out to the frontier, and
                    take a stand at some suitable point and to act as frontier guard.
            General Hull had surrendered his army to the British, and General Harrison's army, that we
                    left at Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , had marched down the Maumee and on the Raisin, and there, under General
                    Winchester's command had been defeated and inhumanly massacred.25 So at
                    that we had no troops, at that time, in the North. There were a number of soldiers that had been
                    furloughed that had returned there, who with several wagons loaded with provisions, were about to
                    start to the army. We all formed a Company under the command of Capt. McNemar, as an escort for the
                    teams, and took our march to follow after the Brigade.
            There was a company of mounted Rangers (as they were called) under command of Captain Manary, that
                    was stationed on the frontier to watch the movement of the Indians, his place of rendezvous was on
                    the route that Gen. Tupper had marched, it was called Manary's block-house.26 We got there in the afternoon and concluded to remain there until the next
                    morning.—There was a banter from the rangers to shoot at a mark with our boys, which was
                    quickly taken up, as our boys boasted on their use of the rifle.—Judges were appointed,

                     after having fired several rounds, the rangers had rather the
                    better of our boys. We had a large awkward looking man in our Company by the name of Wingate Cannon;
                    he had broke the lock of his rifle and had to take a U.S. musket,—they had rather quit
                    shooting, when Cannon came up and said: "Gentlemen, will you let me take a shot?"
                    "Oh! yes, fire away," he drawed up his musket, fired away and drove the centre
                    point blank. No other one had touched the centre. This raised a great shout.
            Two or three of the boys perched him on their shoulders and hurrahed for Cannon. This broke up the
                    shooting match. The next morning we marched forward, and in due time arrived at Gen.
                    Tupper's encampment. It was on the head branches of the Scioto river, in thick-timbered
                    land, principally beach. We took our place on the line of encampment, which was an oblong square, on
                    tolerable high ground. It was first called Camp McArthur (in honor of Col. McArthur, one of the
                    Regimental Commanders in Hull's army), and afterwards it got the name of Fort McArthur; but
                    there was never a Fort built there, although two or three log houses were erected for the purpose of
                    storing military stores.27
            
            We had no idea how long we would remain there. We at first lived in tents; but when the weather began
                    to get cold we built log huts, covered with clapboards, some had chimneys and some had open fronts,
                    with tent cloths hung up in front at night and in cold weather. Our hut was tolerably comfortable;
                    we had a chimney and door, we also chinked and daubed it, and laid a puncheon floor, so that we
                    lived in style, there was but three of us, Captain, myself and our cook. The ensign was discharged
                    by reason of his having fits. Our bed was, to lay down one blanket and cover with the two; we had to
                    lay spoon fashion and if one wished to turn over we had to make a frolic of it and all turn at once.
                    We had easy, and tolerably comfortable times; plenty to eat, not much to do, only provide wood, cook
                    our rations, wash our clothes and occasionally go on fatigue or guard. A great many diverting
                    incidents transpired that winter, whilst we laid there.
            Whilst we lay at Camp McArthur, several circumstances transpired, some of which will be interesting,
                    and some not much so, although the militia, when in service, are as strictly under the rules and
                    articles of war as the regular soldiers are, yet the rules are not so strictly enforced. There is
                    more sociability and familiarity between the officers and privates when off duty. A Major in our

                            McArthur as part of General Hull's advance on

                        Ohio
                    , thought himself too good to associate with common soldiers, and all the men hated him,
                    and played all kind of pranks upon him. It so happened that he was officer of the day, and I was
                    officer of the guard at the same time.—The line of sentinels were placed on the opposite
                    side of a small stream of water running alongside of the camp, and the sentinels had to cross it
                    upon a few poles thrown across for that purpose in relieving guard. Rain of a short time previous
                    had raised the stream considerably, and the boys had plotted to have some fun with the Major that
                    night. It was cloudy and very dark, shortly after which the Major came to the guard and requested a
                    sergeant and file of men to escort him over the grand rounds. The first sentinel they came to, was
                    just on the opposite side of the stream so, soon as the sergeant had crossed over, he was hailed by
                    the sentinel, "who comes there." The answer was "grand
                    rounds."—"Stand fast grand rounds. Advance sergeant and give the
                    countersign." By this time the Major had slipped off the poles and was floundering in the
                    water near waist deep. The sentinel heard him splashing in the water, and called out aloud:
                    "Stand fast, grand rounds, after which he crawled out of the water and passed on. We heard
                    the splashing in the water, and from the tittering amongst the boys I was satisfied that it was a
                    plot they had made up.—There was a sutler that had an establishment near camp, who sold
                    coffee, sugar, butter and whiskey, &c. We had quite a number of men in the ranks that would
                    drink too much whiskey if they could get it. Their rations of whiskey did not satisfy them, and when
                    they had money they would go and buy of the sutler, and some of them would keep drunk nearly all the
                    time. Gen. Tupper issued a general order prohibiting the sutler from selling whiskey to any soldier
                    without a written or verbal permit from some commissioned officer. There were a few men in our
                    company that still got whiskey and kept drunk. Our Captain was sick on furlough, and I had command
                    of the company. I endeavored to find out how they got their whiskey, and at last one of our men told
                    the whole secret. There was a man in lines that had a sword to sell for five dollars; the money was
                    raised; the sword bought, and two or three of them would take the sword and canteen and go to the
                    sutler and ask to buy a quart of whiskey—well where is your
                    permit,—"I have got none, but here is our ensign. Ensign will you permit me to
                    buy a quart of whiskey." "Yes sir, let that man have a quart of whiskey."
                    This was the plan they had contrived to get whiskey, so we took the sword from them. Three of us
                    concluded to go down the river a few miles to try and kill a deer or turkey. We started early one
                    morning, and went down the stream on the same side that our camp was on; we discovered a gang of
                    deers. They started off in different directions, two of them crossed over the stream, and made
                    rather back towards our camp. I crossed over and followed them a  considerable distance, but could not get a shot. I could always see their tails before I could
                    see their bodies, and I finally gave up the chase. I concluded as I had lost my companions, as they
                    had gone down the stream, that I would not follow them, but would look round for some other game,
                    and then follow the stream back to camp. I went down to the stream and followed it up until I was
                    confident I had gone far enough. I concluded I would cross over and get into the road that led up to
                    camp; but when I got to the stream I found it to be a small run with but little water in it. I was
                    then satisfied that it was a branch of the stream that our camp was on, that I knew nothing about.
                    It was cloudy and late in the day, and I was afraid to leave the stream for fear I would get lost,
                    so I concluded to follow it around to camp. I followed on down until dark, when I found a large tree
                    that had fallen. It had broke four or five feet from the ground, and was still attached to the
                    stump. I gathered bark and leaves, and made a comfortable place to sit, with my back against the
                    stump, and covered by the body of the tree which was not over two feet above my head. I set there
                    all night, and although it rained, I kept quite dry, but did not sleep much. Nothing disturbed me
                    except that I heard something run past, which alarmed me some. In the morning I started down the
                    stream without any breakfast, and before I got to the forks of the stream, I heard the cannon boom.
                    The boys that went with me had returned to camp, (having killed no game) and reported that
                    Lieutenant Jackson was lost in the woods, and General Tupper had ordered the cannon to be fired at
                    sun-rise, and every hour afterwards until I was found. I continued down the river to the forks, and
                    crossed over, got into the road, and started up stream towards camp, I presently heard another boom.
                    I continued on and soon met four of our men that had started to hunt for me.—They fired
                    off their guns as a signal that I was found, and we returned to camp, and I felt very much like
                    taking full rations. This was my last deer hunt during the war. During the time we remained at camp
                    McArthur, the stream that we got water from, froze almost dry, and the general ordered a well to be
                    dug inside the encampment. It was commenced large enough for two men to work in it at a time, and
                    one day two of the men fell out and fought right in camp. They were court-marshaled and sentenced to
                    dig in the well two days together, which sentence was put in force. When we first settled here at
                    Elk-hart 
                        Prairie
                    , a man by the name of William Runyan settled here.28 On
                    conversation with him we found that we had been at camp McArthur together. I asked him if he
                    remembered the circumstance 
                  
                     28 Corporal William Runyon was a member of Captain Abner
                            Barrett's company and was probably from

                    one of the men. He went from here to Rolling 
                        Prairie
                     an died there several years ago. He was an uncle to Peter L. Runyan.
            While at camp McArthur the friendly Indians often visited our camp, and would often times stay all
                    night. At one time several came in from Upper Sandusky. Black-Hoop, one of the head chiefs was in
                    company, and the old man stayed in General Tupper's Morgue.29 About 10
                    o'clock at night he was sitting and talking with the General, (he could talk good English),
                    when some person went to one corner of the Morgue, and parting the tent-cloth, presented and fired a
                    pistol at the old chief's head, the ball striking his cheek bone near to his eyes, he fell
                    and lay for some length of time. After a while he sat up and his face was all covered with blood
                    which made him look frightful. Gen. Tupper called in the surgeons who examined the wound, extracted
                    the ball, and pronounced the case not fatal, though a pretty bad wound. They did all they could to
                    alleviate his sufferings. This circumstance occasioned great excitement in camp, and on the next
                    morning a court martial was ordered, and every mess was called up, sworn and examined by the court,
                    as to their whereabouts about the time of the shooting. The examination went all round the lines,
                    every officer, private, and camp follower, being sworn and examined by the court, and everyone
                    proved themselves clear. It was afterwards ascertained that there was three wagoners in camp that
                    night, that started off early the next morning with their teams, and it was finally concluded that
                    it was one of them that had done the mischief, as they did not return back to
                    camp.—Black-hoop sent for an Indian doctor, who stayed and attended him until he was well
                    enough to go home.30
            
            Whilst we were at camp McArthur, our spy company was continually roaving through the country making
                    discoveries. They came into camp one day and reported that there was a body of Indians and some
                    British Red-coats on the North side of the Maumee river at the foot of the rapids, and in their
                    scout they found 
                  
                     29 Black Hoop (or Hoof) was a Shawnee chief who resided near present
                            day Wapakoneta, 
                                Ohio
                            . He signed the Greenville Treaty in 1795 and remained friendly to the Americans
                            throughout the War of 1812. Blue, Centennial History, 160–76.
                  
                     30 According to General Tupper, Black Hoop was wounded on January 25,
                            1813, at about 9:00 p.m. The shot was fired through the chinking in the back of a chimney,
                            indicating that Tupper had a more substantial dwelling than the marquee or
                            "morgue" Jackson refers to. The bullet hit the Indian in the left cheek.
                            Although $350 was offered as a reward by the American officers present to find
                            the culprit and Tupper commenced a lengthy investigation as Jackson describes, the guilty
                            party was never brought to justice. Black Hoop "appeared in misery" after
                            the incident. Knopf, Document Transcriptions, II, 116.
               
                     an Indian and brought him into our camp a prisoner. This I
                    think was in October, 1812.31—General Tupper concluded to go down and
                    route them if possible, and ordered about two-thirds of our force to be ready with cooked rations,
                    to march off early the next morning. We marched off, leaving about one-third behind to keep camp,
                    and with a quick march we arrived at the head of the rapids late on the second evening. The spies
                    had been despatched down the river about three miles, to discover the whereabouts of the enemy, and
                    on their return reported that they were where they had seen them before, and that they were on a
                    frolick, drumming and dancing. Gen. Tupper and the field officers, concluded to wade the river in
                    the night, march down and attack them in the morning before day, each company to be divided into two
                    platoons, each platoon to march in a breast across the river, which ran pretty swift on the rapids.
                    We were formed and started to cross over. The night was pretty dark, when the foremost had got
                    partly over, and those that were behind had swaged down stream to where the water was deeper. Some
                    men had began to loose their feet, and an alarm was raised that some men were drowning, which
                    throwed the line all into confusion. Those that were in front of the confusion marched on, and those
                    in the rear turned back. The field officers rode in and rescued those that was likely to drown, and
                    there we were, part on one side of the river and part on the other side. Some few lost their guns
                    that were never found. Gen. Tupper ordered those that had got over to re-cross back, so that we were
                    all where we started from. We then went a short distance from the river, built fires to dry our
                    clothes, and bivouked on the ground until morning. Early in the morning the spy company was sent
                    down the river, to ascertain if the enemy had discovered us, and to ascertain their movements; they
                    saw no particular stir, but discovered a canoe loaded with a few Indians coming across the river.
                    They lay in ambush, and when the canoe struck shore, and the Indians began to land, they fired on
                    them, saw one Indian fall, and another crawl up to the fence seemingly in great pain. The spies then
                    retreated and came and reported. We heard the firing, and was formed in line of battle and proceeded
                    to march down the river. We had gone probably a mile when we heard the Indians in front of us
                    yelling like savages. They had supposed that they had overtaken the spies that had fired on the
                    canoe, and ran up to within a hundred yards of our line, before they discovered our force. They then
                    fired and retreated as fast as they came, we returned the fire, but without doing them any injury.
                    One of our men was shot in the hand. We 
                  
                     31 Jackson is again in error regarding the date. According to General
                            Tapper's report the expedition left camp on November 10 and returned on the 16th or
                            17th. Esarey, Messages and Letters, II, 216–21.
               
                     then marched down and formed a line on our side of the river,
                    and the Indians and red-coats on the opposite side. The Queen Charlotte had brought up the troops
                    from the lake, and was now lying at the foot of the rapids. She fired two guns, and started down the
                    river, while the British paraded with drum and fife, and the Indians yelled all round. As our
                    rations were nearly gone, and we had no way of crossing the river, Gen. Tupper concluded to return
                    back to camp McArthur; so we proceeded up the river probably two miles, when one of the spies came
                    running back and told the General, that the Indians were crossing the river just above us as thick
                    as black-birds. We went with a quick march, or rather ran, until we got opposite to where they were
                    crossing, and formed a line on the bank, which was probably about one hundred yards from the river.
                    Some few Indians had got over, and the river was filled with them, and the woods on the other side
                    also perfectly alive with them. We commenced firing on them, and they commenced retreating, every
                    one fired off his gun, before starting back through the water. In the midst of the flurry it was
                    discovered that a number of mounted red-coats had crossed the river somewhere and was about to
                    attack our rear. A regiment was immediately ordered to meet them, and fired at them, when they
                    retreated in quick time. It was not known how much damage they received, but they were seen to cross
                    back with one empty horse.—Not one of our men was hurt as they shot over us. Three of our
                    men had straggled off from our lines, who we heard afterwards was killed and scalped. We did not
                    know at that time how many Indians were killed, but we afterwards learned that there was seven
                    killed and some wounded. Some were seen to fall in the river. This was all the fighting that I
                    participated in during the war. Although Gen. Tupper reported it as a battle, yet from what I read
                    of, and what I heard my father tell of the battles that he was in, in the revolutionary war, I never
                    called it but a ‘slight skirmish.’ I did not get to know fairly whether I
                    would make a good soldier or not, but I always supposed that I would make about as good a soldier as
                    the dutchman, when he got into a battle, he was heard to say ‘plut for plut, I would
                    shoost so soon lif as tie.’ We then resumed our march towards camp McArthur. When we left
                    where we had bivouked during the night, there was two men left, one was sick, and the other was not
                    right well, who staid to take care of the sick man, we did not go back to where they were, but
                    angled to the left so as to strike the road that we came on, some miles in advance. I did not know
                    there was any persons left there until there was inquiries made along the lines that evening for two
                    volunteers, to go back and ascertain what had become of the two men. I think ten dollars to each,
                    was offered, one of our boys volunteered with another man to go, and they went back that night, and
                    found them killed and scalped.—They covered them over with logs and brush, and it then
                    being near morning,  they went a short distance, got into a
                    thicket and stayed all day. At night they followed on, but did not overtake us until we got in camp.
                    We lay there doing nothing, had a good deal of sickness, principally bilious fever and yellow
                    jaundice, several deaths occurring.
            Some time in January, 1813, Gen. Harrison determined to make a stand at Fort Meigs (where Perrysburg
                    now stands) and we were ordered to march to that place. The weather was very cold, and the snow
                    quite deep, and through the Black swamp the ground was not frozen, which made it quite hard
                        traveling.32 We started with a six pound cannon, and although four horses
                    were put to the carriage, they could not draw it, so we had to leave it in the Black swamp. At night
                    we could cut down a beach sapling, trim off the limbs, make a brush heap on top of the snow, cover
                    it with a blanket, put our knapsacks down for a pillow, lie down on it, cover ourselves with two
                    other blankets, and get up in the morning almost frozen. We marched on this way until we arrived at
                    Fort Meigs.33 Our spy company always on the alert, went down the Maumee river to
                    the lake, and got information from some inhabitants there, that there was a party of Indians
                    encamped some where in the neighborhood, and were killing and destroying the cattle and hogs
                    belonging to the citizens. Gen. Tupper sent a detachment of about four companies (I think under
                    command of Major Beasley,) to kill or destroy them.34 They started down on the
                    ice just in the evening and went to the settlement where they were reported to be, but the Indians
                    had left, and the party returned that evening. None of our company had ever seen lake Erie, and
                    after they returned, those of our company that did not go, was very inquisitive to know how the lake
                    looked. One of the boys that went being a very dry kind of a chap, told them that the sky and the
                    lake came so near together, that there did not seem to be room for a fellows hat between. In our
                    passage out from where we had left the cannon, we had broke the road so that it froze pretty solid
                    and was tolerable smooth. A party was sent back and brought it to camp. One day, whilst a number of
                    us were sliding on the ice on

                             that measured over a hundred miles long and forty miles wide. Practically every
                            large army marching through this part of the state took pains to avoid the area. Alec R.

                    at a shanty on the opposite side of the river, where Maumee city now stands. The ball went whizzing
                    over the boys heads, on the ice, and they knowing nothing about the camp of the shooting came
                    scampering off of the river in quick time, being very much frightened. The first shot missed, but
                    the second hit the shanty, and made the dust fly. It must have been nearly a mile distant.35
            
            In about ten days, troops commenced coming in from

                        Clay
                     and Dudley, did not arrive until after we left.36 We continued
                    there in camp, until near the middle of February when the term of service of our Brigade expired;
                    and Gen. Harrison wishing to deliver an address to his soldiers, had caused a four square rail pen
                    to be built, ten feet high, and covered with flat rails, as there was no lumber there. We were
                    formed into a hollow square around the rail pile, when Gen. Harrison crawled up like a coon, and
                    stood up at least six feet high. He had a long Roman nose, a sharp keen eye that seemed to pierce
                    through a person at the first glance, and his face looked as sharp as a broad axe. He rehearsed the
                    situation of this part of our country; that Hull had surrendered our army: that the 
                        Kentucky
                     troops were massacred at River Raisin; that we had to fall back to where we now were;
                    that he did not know how soon the enemy might be upon us; that the troops that he had expected had
                    not arrived, and that in view of all the circumstances, he requested that the troops whose term of
                    service was about to expire, would volunteer to stay one month longer, and he would guarantee their
                    pay. He said that it was only a request, as he had no authority to order them to stay. We were then
                    dismissed at the evening parade, and the subject was discussed by our company. Some were for
                    staying, and some for going home. We had suffered very much for the last month with cold and
                    fatigue, and the men had become very home sick. It was left to a vote, and about two thirds voted to
                    go home, some companies stayed, but a majority of our Brigade went home. I would willingly have
                    stayed, but an officer dare not encourage any one to stay, for it would be thrown up to him that it
                    was money that prompted him to stay, as he was getting high 
                  
                     35 The cannon shot referred to was perhaps fired on the evening of
                            February 8 when an American eighteen pound gun fired from Fort Meigs into a house across the
                            Maumee River. Two days later, Harrison sent part of the army out on the expedition referred
                            to by Jackson. By February 13 the

                     wages. I was very glad to hear afterwards that the troops had
                    all got on before they were attacked.37
            
            We received our discharge papers on the 15th day of February 1813, drawed and cooked two days
                    rations, and started for home. The weather had become warm, and rain following for the past two
                    days, had melted the snow, and the ground was deluged with water.—On arriving at the
                    black swamp, it was discovered to be all flooded with water, so we built log heaps of fire, and
                    proposed to remain there all night. The weather in the evening had turned quite cold, and in the
                    morning there was ice on the water, more than a half inch thick, but would not bear a man's
                    weight. We were then hemmed up like the children of 
                        Israel
                     at the Red Sea, and were forced to go forward, so we formed in double file, and the ice
                    broke through at every step, and the water underneath being from six inches to a foot in depth. When
                    the two men in front were pretty well tired out breaking the ice, they would step aside, and fall
                    back to the rear, and let the next file go ahead, in this way we continued on until we found some
                    high ground where there was no ice, then we would halt and take the bits of ice out of our shoes (we
                    had no boots then) and after running and jumping, around for a few minutes to warm and keep our
                    blood in circulation, we would continue our "wade" for several miles until we got
                    through the swamp. We reached Fort Finley just at night.38—Built
                    large fires, changed our pants and socks, hung them up to dry, ate our rations, and prepared to
                    remain there all night. We started early next morning, but had to wade through considerable ice and
                    water, although not so much as the previous day. We continued on to 
                        Urbana
                    , where we rested part of a day, and staid all night.—Here we drew two days
                    rations and cooked it, and the next morning started for home. We kept together the first day and
                    night, and the next morning we broke off into squares, the men becoming anxious to get home, those
                    that could walk fastest going ahead.—The rest marched on just as they could stand it. Our
                    feet had become very sore by the ice in our shoes. Some few got home late that night, but the most
                    part did not get home until the next day. It so happened that not one of our company died during the
                    campaign, but all got home alive. Thus ended my first campaign in the service.

                         militiamen were discharged on February 24, 1813. Harrison told the secretary of war
                        that although the militiamen would not stay for even one more month he was sure that if he was
                        ready to advance into 
                            Canada

            In the fall of the same year, 1813, (as I have no dates but write from recollection), I think it was
                    the latter part of September,39 General Harrison's head quarters were
                    at Fort Meigs, the British had landed a force at Sandusky Bay, and were about to invade the country
                    in that quarter. All the troops that we had in that quarter, was a small command under Major
                    Croghan, at Fort Stephenson.40 Gen. Harrison fearing his forces were too weak to
                    oppose the force that might come against him, sent an express to Governor Meigs to send him a
                    reinforcement of troops immediately. Accordingly the Governor ordered out the militia in our part of
                    the State, en-masse, to rendezvous at Circleville, and in a few days we were en-route for the scene
                    of action. I in the meantime had been promoted to the Captaincy of an infantry company. We marched
                    on, passing through where the City of 
                        Columbus
                     now stands, when it was an unbroken forest. We continued our march to upper Sandusky,
                    where we were met by Gen. Harrison and his staff, who ordered us to halt there, and go no further,
                    as our services were not required. The British forces had attacked Fort Stephenson, and Major
                    Croghan had whipped the whole force, and they had gone back to 
                        Canada
                    . Gen. Harrison was accused at that time of being rather cowardly, of being scared
                    before he was hurt, but I never believed there was any cowardice about him, although he acted
                    cautiously. We lay at Upper Sandusky that night, and the next morning were paraded in line, six men
                    deep. Gen. Harrison delivered a short address, thanked us for our promptness for coming to his
                    relief, and the Adjutant General then mustered us out of service. It was said that there was between
                    six and seven thousand of us together there. We then started for home, and arrived there safe,
                    without the loss of a man. Thus ended my military service in the war of 1812.

            Historians of the Ku Klux Klan movement of the 1920s are quite familiar with David C. Stephenson. As
                    leader of the Indiana Klan, Stephenson presided over the largest and politically strongest state
                    Klan organization in a massive national movement that may have included five million members. He
                    became powerful enough to threaten national Klan leaders for control of the organization as the
                    movement reached its zenith between the summer of 1923 and the fall of 1924. Stephenson was so
                    successful at working his way into the inner circles of the state Republican party that he became a
                    powerful political boss when the Klan swept the state election of 1924. Perhaps most significantly,
                    he was so well known that the scandal surrounding his convictions for rape and second degree murder
                    in 1925 played a large part in undermining the Klan movement not only in Indiana but throughout the
                    nation.

                     books intended to bring the story of Stephenson's rise
                    and fall to the general public. Both represent vast improvements over the National Broadcast
                    Company's shallow, frequently inaccurate mini-series on Stephenson produced in 1989. Both
                    present lively narratives describing the Klan's origins in 
                        Evansville
                    , its bigoted ideals, Stephenson's rise to power, his sensational trial, and
                    the accompanying political scandals. Tucker's book is particularly successful in
                    synthesizing traditional sources into a readable, concise format. Lutholtz's Grand Dragon relies on much more original research than Tucker's book and
                    presents new, interesting information about Stephenson's life, about his relations with
                    other political leaders in Indiana during the Klan era, and especially about Stephenson's
                    trial.
            Yet, while readers unfamiliar with the saga of Stephenson would have good reason to find these books
                    worthwhile, scholars will encounter little new evidence or analysis concerning the deeper question
                    of the Klan's enormous popularity. Tucker and Lutholtz both accept the traditional view
                    (first proclaimed by old guard Republican leaders in Indiana in an attempt to distance the party
                    from the Klan after the scandals of the mid-1920s) that Stephenson was an evil genius who had
                    masterminded the Klan's success by manipulating and deceiving a vast army of loyal Klan
                    foot soldiers. The traditional view greatly exaggerates Stephenson's power and
                    significantly distorts the role of a single leader, and leadership in general, in a grass roots
                    social movement. One consequence of viewing the story of the Indiana Klan as the story of Stephenson
                    is that those who actually joined the Klan fade into the background, appearing as little more than
                    the hapless dupes of a huckster and as backward people who needed an organization like the Klan to
                    vent their aberrant views. Perhaps the clearest expression of this view comes in another recent book
                    by Wyn Craig Wade. According to Wade, the Klan succeeded in Indiana primarily because of the
                    "clannishness and backwardness" of the people of Indiana, a state that had been
                    populated to a large degree by the "displaced, uneducated Southern rustic." The
                    ingrained "simplicity" and "narrow minded arrogance" of
                    Indiana's citizens represented, according to Wade, "the weakness that the Ku Klux
                    Klan would exploit to the hilt."1 While Lutholtz and Tucker do not
                    state their views in quite this way, they paint a similarly simplistic picture of the Klan movement.

            One additional aspect of Lutholtz's book is worth noting here. The author's
                    diligent efforts to uncover information about Stephen-son's life are marred by an excessive
                    focus on "unsolved mysteries" surrounding Stephenson's trial,
                    particularly the question of the moral character of the woman Stephenson assaulted and speculation
                    as to Stephenson's guilt or innocence. As Lutholtz's own evidence shows,
                    Stephenson inflicted severe bite wounds to Madge Oberholtzer's face, neck, breasts, and
                    other parts of her body. Those wounds became infected and contributed to a slow, agonizing death.
                    And, of course, he also kept her away from medical help for what turned out to be a fatal period of
                    time after she took poison in what she told her family doctor was a suicide attempt. In the face of
                    these events Lutholtz's extensive speculation about whether Oberholtzer really was the
                    "virginal child" described by prosecutors, or whether Stephenson was actually set
                    up by his political enemies, seems, at best, irrelevant.
            Kathleen M. Blee's Women of the Klan represents a much more substantial
                    attempt to explore the social roots of the Indiana Klan movement. Blee, who teaches sociology at the
                    University of 
                        Kentucky
                    , has made an ambitious first step in analyzing the role of gender in the 1920s Klan and
                    in right-wing movements generally  in modern American history.
                    She uncovers a good deal of information about the leaders of the women's Klan in Indiana
                    that escaped other authors, including this one.2 Similar to other recent studies
                    of Klan organizations in various parts of the nation, Blee's book argues that the
                    Klan's bigotry was mainstream rather than aberrant. Much of her evidence demonstrates the
                    Klan's community orientation, its role as a social organization, and its involvement in a
                    wide variety of civic affairs. Her findings suggest very strongly that leaders in the
                    women's Klan were active in the suffrage and prohibition movements. This is quite
                    consistent with what historians have found about the Klan's political orientation in
                    virtually all of the communities and states that have been investigated in recent years. A very
                    close relationship existed between the Women's Christian Temperance Union, the Anti-Saloon
                    League, and the Klan in Indiana and throughout the nation. Membership in each of these groups almost
                    certainly overlapped significantly, and support for prohibition enforcement, it now seems clear,
                    represented the single most important catalyst to the Klan's mass popularity in the
                        1920s.3 It certainly would not be surprising to learn that many or most of
                    the women who joined the Klan had been supporters of the suffrage movement.
            The importance of Blee's topic, her success in some areas, and the interesting questions she
                    raises, however, are not enough to make up for a long list of major flaws. One of these is
                    Blee's inability to present any significant evidence about the size and social
                    characteristics of the women's organization. Blee attempts to compensate for a lack of any
                    extensive membership records, a problem common in studying the Klan, by reporting information
                    gathered about 118 Klanswomen whose names were taken from an undisclosed number of scattered,
                    unidentified newspaper articles; one membership list of perhaps ten to twenty names (she does not
                    report the total); an unspecified number of uncited obituaries from the Fiery
                    Cross (the Klan's state newspaper); and a number of other newspaper obituaries (which
                    she does cite).4 It is impossible to draw any reliable conclusions from such a
                    body of evidence. Blee also makes use of eighteen interviews and six written statements from
                    "anonymous informants" who contacted her in response to advertisements placed in a
                    large number of newspapers and other community publications. While the informants provide what would

                     be interesting supplemental material, they are too few, too
                    potentially unrepresentative, and too far removed from events more than six decades old to merit the
                    weight placed on them in this book.
            Unfortunately, the tendency to use evidence in highly questionable ways—or simply not to
                    document important claims—runs throughout the book. There are numerous examples, but some
                    of the more significant include: a map indicating the location of Women of the Ku Klux Klan chapters
                    throughout the state (no source cited); a claim that "historians estimate the total
                    membership of Indiana's WKKK as a quarter-million during the 1920's, or 32 percent
                    of the entire white native-born female population of the state" (no source
                    cited—this figure would make the women's Klan as large or perhaps even larger
                    than the men's Klan); and the use of uncited crowd size estimates of women attending public
                    initiation ceremonies, parades, and other Klan events to calculate the percentage of Klanswomen
                    among all native-born white women for forty Indiana towns and cities.5
            
            Blee's potentially important observations about the role of gender in the Klan movement are
                    weakened not only by these problems of documentation, but also by her failure to explore in
                    sufficient detail the nature of the larger Klan movement. She bypasses such sources as the extensive
                    membership documents that exist for the men's Klan in Indiana; the state's
                    Catholic, Jewish, and black newspapers; and other evidence. Instead, she relies strongly on
                    Wade's account, the traditional emphasis on Stephen-son, and other journalistic and
                    secondary sources. Blee proceeds too often on the assumption that the history of the men's
                    Klan is well known while the history of the women's Klan is obscure. While there is
                    certainly some reason for this assumption, it would appear difficult to examine the role of gender
                    in a mass social movement without exploring the entire movement in greater depth. Perhaps the safest

                    modern right-wing and conservative movements is that there remains much to be learned about both the men and women who have taken part in them.

               Homer E. Capehart: A Senator's Life, 1897–1979. By William
                    B. Pickett. (

                    : Indiana Historical Society, 1990. Pp. xv, 243. Illustrations, notes, bibliographical
                    essay, index. $27.95.)
            Homer E. Capehart had two careers, first as a businessman and then from 1945 until 1963 as Republican
                    senator for Indiana. William B. Pickett's authoritative study, the first biography of
                    Capehart, provides insights into the businessman and the politician.
            Capehart rose from relatively humble origins thanks to his talents as a salesman, but his most famous
                    business venture, the establishment of the Capehart Corporation to produce high-quality phonographs,
                    ended in failure in 1932. Nevertheless, he rebounded to become a millionaire by 1938 after
                    persuading the Wurlitzer company that coin-operated jukeboxes would become profitable in the
                    post-Prohibition era.
            Capehart's values grew out of the conservatism of his rural Indiana background and his
                    embodiment of free enterprise success. As a first-term senator he became a stalwart of the
                    Republican right, a nationalist on foreign policy, and a virulent critic of big government. Also,
                    partly owing to intense anticommunism and partly for partisan advantage, he was an early
                    practitioner of McCarthyism. Viewing this as the worst blot on his record, Pickett fully explains
                    Capehart's involvement in McCarthyism and how, in part because of his political nous but
                    also because of the modifying influence of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Hoosier senator avoided
                    entanglement in its worst excesses.
            Pickett's confident expositions of the complex patterns of Indiana politics, shaped by
                    ideology, factionalism, and personal ambitions, are the most illuminating sections of the book.
                    Capehart's relationship with archconservative Hoosier senator William E. Jenner, which
                    shifted from friendship to enmity, is particularly well analyzed. Coverage of Capehart's
                    electoral tactics, notably his meet-the-people approach, also conveys the flavor of state politics
                    in the mid-twentieth century. To some extent, Capehart's surprising election defeat by
                    Birch Bayh in 1962 was due to the growth of the suburban electorate and the development of the media
                    campaign, which had overtaken tactics better suited to attracting rural voters.
            
            Somewhat disappointingly Pickett holds back from similarly detailed analysis of Capehart's
                    role within national politics. The senator's own political positions are well analyzed, but
                    a more thorough coverage of his involvement in the internal GOP feud between old guard and modern
                    Republicans would have been welcome. Unlike many conservatives, Capehart did prove flexible and
                    modified his views in response to changing times. In the 1957—1958 recession, for
                    example, he favored a more interventionist approach, particularly on housing policy, than Eisenhower
                    himself.
            Pickett presents Capehart as a basically decent man with firm beliefs, a politician who tried to do
                    his best for state and nation. Liberal contemporaries tended to dismiss him as an inarticulate and
                    unsophisticated conservative whose politics rested on simplistic views. Nevertheless, his
                    convictions that the 
                        Soviet Union
                     was not as large a threat in the late 1940s as Harry S Truman claimed and that
                    government should be thrifty appear far-sighted from the perspective of the 1990s. Pickett has
                    produced a worthy biography of this important Hoosier politician, one that deserves attention from
                    all interested in Indiana and American political history in the postwar years.

               Indiana Quakers Confront the Civil War. By Jacquelyn S. Nelson. (
                        Indianapolis
                    : Indiana Historical Society, 1991. Pp. xvii, 303. Tables, appendixes, notes, selected
                    bibliography, index. $27.95.)
            Since 1985 Jacquelyn S. Nelson has drawn the attention of historians of Quakerism with articles, in
                    the Indiana Magazine of History and elsewhere, describing the experiences of
                    Indiana Friends during the Civil War. This volume, based on Nelson's dissertation, brings
                    the results of her prodigious research to a wider audience.
            Nelson's most important finding challenges the image of Quakers as observant pacifists.
                    During the Civil War at least 1,212 Indiana Friends, about a quarter of all 
                        Quaker
                     men between fifteen and forty-nine, took up arms. This is a far higher number than
                    advanced by previous historians although proportionally it is far less than the 62 percent of the
                    eligible men among the general Hoosier population. Nelson ably sketches these Friends'
                    wartime experiences, which were not much different from those of non-
                        Quaker
                     soldiers. The book concludes with informative accounts of  how civilian Friends aided the Union war effort and of the experiences
                    of 
                        Quaker
                     conscientious objectors.
            Nelson's work, however, has three major problems. The first is methodological. Her work was
                    possible in large part because the excellent records left by Indiana Friends have been abstracted
                    and published. Nelson found that about half of her soldiers were "dealt with" by
                    their congregations for departing from 
                        Quaker
                     beliefs. By comparing membership records with army and militia enlistment records,
                    however, she identified another 600 whose service was tolerated. Two-thirds of the book consists of
                    a list of these soldiers, along with another of veterans buried in 
                        Quaker
                     cemeteries. The effort is impressive, but having worked in the same records, this
                    reviewer has reservations about the result. A check of about 10 percent of Nelson's list
                    showed that at least 20 percent of her identifications were questionable—the 
                        Quaker
                     soldier was confused with another person or was not where Nelson placed him or did not
                    appear in 
                        Quaker
                     records as a member at any time.
            Part of the problem is Nelson's uncertain definition of a 
                        Quaker
                    . There were hundreds of ex-Friends in Indiana in 1861, many of whom had joined other
                    denominations. Nelson claims to have excluded them from her list, but there are some notable
                    exceptions. Major General Solomon Meredith was born a 
                        Quaker
                     but lost his membership in 1829. There is no evidence that he ever regained it.
                    Lieutenant Colonel Martin L. Bundy was reared by 
                        Quaker
                     relatives but never joined Friends. Thomas Addington of 
                        Randolph County
                    , a 
                        Quaker
                     turned Disciples of Christ minister and chaplain, certainly would be surprised to find
                    himself counted as a 
                        Quaker
                     soldier. This problem is not fatal to Nelson's argument, but it means that her
                    list must be used with caution.
            Nelson's second problem is what she does with this data. Readers finish this book without a
                    clear sense of why some Friends held to tradition and others did not, why some 
                        Quaker
                     congregations tolerated members as soldiers and others moved against them. Were 
                        Quaker
                     soldiers the less wealthy who could not afford to pay commutation fees to avoid
                    service? Correlating her names with the statistics on individual wealth in the 1860 census would be
                    revealing. Did 
                        Quaker
                     soldiers come from families whose other members were lax in observance of 
                        Quaker
                     tradition? Systematic analysis of the 
                        Quaker
                     records would answer such questions. Quakers lived under exacting rules; the disownment
                    of young Friends who decided on reaching adulthood to repudiate such a life was common. Since the
                    overwhelming majority of Nelson's soldiers were under twenty-five, one has to wonder how
                    many would have found some other reason to leave the society. It would be revealing to know how many
                    were still Quakers in 1875.
            Nelson's failure to ask these questions may relate to the absence from her bibliography of
                    scholarship since 1982. Richard E.  Wood's 1985
                    dissertation, "Evangelical Quakers in the 
                        Mississippi
                     Valley, 1854–1894," and this reviewer's The
                        Transformation of American Quakerism: Orthodox Friends, 1800–1907 (1988) have
                    much to say about the acculturation of Indiana Friends between 1850 and 1870 and would have given
                    Nelson and the readers a much richer context.
            Nelson's basic argument is sound—more Indiana Quakers served in the Union army
                    than anyone before had ever guessed. Given Nelson's prodigious research, however, it is
                    unfortunate that many of her identifications are suspect and that the data was not used more
                    imaginatively.

            The German-American Center and the Indiana German Heritage Society, Inc., in their second publication
                    venture, have enhanced the study of 
                        Indianapolis
                     by producing a bilingual edition of Theodore Stempfel's Festschrift [festival publication], originally prepared to commemorate the opening of Das
                    Deutsche Haus (now the Athenaeum) in 
                        Indianapolis
                    .
            Stempfel, who immigrated to 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1884 and joined with the sizeable German community, drafted this history to mark his
                    countrymen's contributions to the social and cultural life of the capital city. He
                    consulted volumes of German-language newspapers and minutes of numerous vereins
                    (unions or associations), supplementing them with the recollections of older German citizens. In
                    preparing this monograph, Stempfel captured important primary sources, many of which are now gone,
                    and preserved the record of this vibrant ethnic community during its formative years.
            The author's purpose is purely descriptive and commemorative, not analytical or
                    all-encompassing. He briefly recounts the causes of German emigration and the ways in which
                    newcomers became Americanized politically yet retained their native customs and manners. Through
                    brief, detailed narratives of singing societies, athletic associations, German-language schools, and
                    cultural events, Stempfel describes the successes of the "liberal thinkers" in

                        Indianapolis
                    , all of which culminated in the building of Das Deutsche Haus. He focuses on what he
                    labels "the best element" (p. 3)—the idealists or freethinkers of
                    1848—and excludes from his account any coverage of the lower social classes and the
                    vibrant religious life of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     German community.
            The Festschrift is extremely valuable to anyone interested in the history of late
                    nineteenth-century 
                        Indianapolis
                    . The text provides descriptions of "lost 
                        Indianapolis
                    ," lists of members and officers of local vereins, and an
                    "historical advertising section" profiling the German-American business sector of
                    the city for 1898. The volume is illustrated with wonderful photographs of Das Deutsche Haus and
                    other key German cultural structures. This new edition could have been enhanced, however, by a
                    photographic reproduction of the original text.
            The sponsors of this reprint are to be commended for preserving this valuable historical record of 
                        Indianapolis
                     and its people. When used in conjunction with Jacob Piatt Dunn's Greater

                (1951; reprinted 1989), the reader can obtain a comprehensive view of the
                    city's German-American community in the late nineteenth century. It is hoped that as we
                    approach the 175th anniversary of the city's founding other organizations will follow this
                    example and make additional out-of-print historical materials available to the public.

                    testing facility. The new base's southern boundary was to be four miles north of 
                        Madison
                    , Indiana, with the rest of the facility stretching north through portions of Jefferson,
                    Jennings, and 
                        Ripley
                     counties. As many as 5,000 construction workers built 120 buildings, miles of roads and
                    rail lines, observation bunkers, and four runways. As construction continued, initial munitions
                    testing began only 155 days after the site selection was disclosed.
            Sue Baker, a longtime professional genealogist, not only chronicles the history of Jefferson Proving
                    Ground but also provides a substantial amount of information about the people who lived on the land
                    absorbed by the facility. The base area had been  a place of
                    farms and crossroad villages, where churches, schools, and general stores had served as the focal
                    points of community interaction. By 1940 many families had been established on the land for a
                    century. The new facility abruptly forced some 2,000 people off their ancestral lands and caused
                    some 3,500 of the residents' forebears in local cemeteries to be disinterred and moved.
            The strength of the book is in its meticulous collection of data on the people and institutions of
                    the area: hundreds of individuals are mentioned by name; numerous pioneer, family, and Civil War
                    anecdotes are related; and several churches and schools are described.
            The three major weaknesses of the work are the author's failure to provide adequate broader
                    contexts for her data, to draw generalizations from her facts that would make them more useful and
                    informative, and to provide enough information about Jefferson Proving Grounds. Despite pages of
                    detail on churches, schools, and individuals the reader does not get a good sense of what life was
                    like in the 1930s or why the forced exodus was so traumatic. Other Hoosier civilian displacements
                    are mentioned, but no comparisons or other historical contexts are provided. The World War II
                    experience of the base is covered in barely six pages, fewer pages than are spent on local Civil War
                    anecdotes. Very basic information, such as how many civilian and military personnel worked at the
                    base, is omitted. No references to any primary or secondary military sources are found in the
                    bibliography.
            Readers interested in Jefferson Proving Ground or the World War II domestic history of Indiana will
                    be disappointed by this book. Those with local or genealogical interests in Jefferson, Jennings, or 
                        Ripley
                     counties will find interesting information.

            During the first quarter of this century, one of the nation's most innovative interurban
                    companies was Interstate Public Service, whose 117-mile line connected 
                        Indianapolis
                     and 
                  Louisville, Kentucky
               . Jerry Marlette examines with thoroughness and
                    insight Indiana's last traditional interurban. His narrative carries the reader through the
                    company's trials by flood, tornado, and financial 
                    reverses. Marlette approaches the Interstate topically, beginning with the necessary tedium of
                    component corporate histories. This sets the stage for extension of a Falls Cities suburban network
                    northward until it links with a line from 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Marlette goes on to discuss rights of way, structures, passenger and freight service
                    and equipment, and safety and accidents. Forty-two maps and charts and 428 photos, a corporate
                    family tree, equipment roster, track maps, and time tables buttress the work.
            Almost unique among interurbans, Interstate offered an overnight sleeper, scheduling a long layover
                    en route. It also carried dining and parlor cars and promoted air-traction connections. Using
                    newspapers and billboards, it broadcast its message widely, including the joys of living north of
                    the 
                        Ohio
                     River and commuting to

            Interstate was formed in 1912 when it acquired operation of lines south of Seymour and leased the
                    road north to 
                        Indianapolis
                    . This became the Hoosier and Dixie Flyers route, which eventually shrank running time
                    to 3 1/4 hours. The private automobile devastated the traction industry, and in 1930 Interstate
                    joined most Hoosier lines as part of the new Indiana Railroad. But merger savings failed to stem the
                    flow of red ink and in 1939 Indiana Railroad abandoned the Seymour-
                        Louisville
                     segment, although it continued to operate thirty-six daily runs to and from 
                        Indianapolis
                    . By 1941 service was cut to a single daily round trip while the company wrestled with
                    the problem of terminating a lease that would expire 971 years later. A fatal head-on collision near 
                        Columbus
                     on September 8, 1941, which destroyed half the rolling stock, solved the problem.
            
            If the line had lasted another three months, America would have been at war, and the road would soon
                    have been serving sprawling Camp Atterbury near Edinburgh. Perhaps, then, its life would have been
                    extended beyond the war. Marlette raises the intriguing question, "What
                    if…?" Today a lone remnant survives in the five-mile diesel-powered Southern
                    Indiana Railway, which serves a cement mill at Speed.

            Revivalism is a distinctive and an enduring characteristic of American religion. It began with the
                    religious awakenings in the northern colonies in the 1730s and with the itinerant preaching of
                    George Whitefield in southern and northern colonies at the end of that decade and into the next.
                    From that time much of North American Protestantism became a religion of conversion, and revivalism is now used to designate certain theological understandings of
                    conversion and, especially, the concrete strategies or methods by which persons could be led to
                    conversion experiences.
            Three recent studies of American revivalism and revivalists are worth the attention of any student of
                    American culture. Paul K. Conkin has produced in Cane Ridge: America's
                        Pentecost a rich and readable account of a 
                        Kentucky
                     revival in 1801. The Cane Ridge revival has become legendary, and it has had a major
                    impact on the shape of Protestantism in southern Indiana, 
                        Illinois
                    , and 
                        Ohio
                     and in the states of the mid-South. The adoption by some Presbyterian ministers,
                    especially those associated with Cane Ridge, of highly charged and emotional revival methods and
                    their move away from traditional Calvinist doctrines of predestination and human depravity led to
                    the splintering of Presbyterianism and the formation of a new Presbyterian body, the Cumberland
                    Presbyterian Church. The Cane Ridge revival and others like it were  also instrumental in the rise of the Restoration or Christian Movement
                    that took form in the Christian church (Disciples of Christ), Christian churches, and Churches of
                    Christ. Conkin also argues that the most extreme forms of revival ecstasy practiced on the frontier
                    paved the way for the spread of Shaker communities throughout 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Kentucky
                    .
            Conkin's contribution is a significant one. He traces the basic format of the Cane Ridge
                    meeting back to the large joint communion services held annually or seasonally by Presbyterian
                    churches in 
                        Scotland
                     and Ulster. Until now, the European and sacramental character of the Cane Ridge revival
                    has been deemphasized or lost entirely in many accounts. Throughout, Conkin's posture is
                    respectful, and he presents the physical responses of the crowd (falling in a swoon, jerking,
                    dancing, etc.) and the perspectives of contending factions within the churches in a fair and
                    evenhanded way.
            The other two books reviewed here have as their subjects the lives and careers of prominent
                    revivalists. William Vance Trollinger, Jr.'s account of the religious empire built by
                    William Bell Riley is impressive and interesting. Riley, born in 1861 in 
                        Greene
                     County, Indiana, a student at 
                        Valparaiso
                     Normal School and 
                        Hanover
                     College, was the most important leader of Northern Baptist fundamentalists during the
                    famed fundamentalist-modernist controversy that rocked the nation in the 1920s. By using one
                    fundamentalist leader and the empire he created, Trollinger provides a case study in the nature of
                    American fundamentalism and the reasons behind its ongoing success. Riley, longtime minister of
                    First Baptist Church in 
                        Minneapolis
                    , campaigned tirelessly against the teaching of evolution, founded Northwestern Bible
                    and Missionary Training School, and was almost single-handedly responsible for the drift of Baptists
                    and their churches in the upper Midwest into the fundamentalist orbit. This important contribution
                    to the understanding of fundamentalism is thoroughly researched and clearly written.
            Lyle W. Dorsett's biography of Billy Sunday, perhaps the most famous twentieth-century
                    revivalist before Billy Graham, is the best account available of Sunday's personal life. It
                    is a sympathetic biography, written for a general audience, that does not ignore Sunday's
                    shortcomings and failures. Born into poverty in 
                        Iowa
                     in 1862, Sunday, as he grew, left an orphanage for a local business concern, left
                    business for professional baseball, and baseball for full-time evangelism. By 1918 Sunday and his
                    family were spectacularly famous and wealthy. His most successful revivals were held in the
                    nation's largest cities, where he was hosted by prominent political and business leaders.
                    After 1921, however, his empire began to decline, as his methods were being discredited and as he
                    faced financial difficulties and family scandals. Nevertheless, when  he died in 1935 (at his home and conference center in Winona
                        Lake, Indiana), he left a legacy still very much alive today, a legacy that includes
                    the successful revivalism of Billy Graham and Jerry Falwell.

            During the 1770s 
                        Delaware
                     and Mahican converts to Christianity, with Moravians whom they called
                    "teachers," set up several mission towns near the Tuscarawas branch of the
                    Muskingum River in the 
                        Ohio
                     Country. The Moravians were German-speaking pietists who had undertaken missions in
                    North America ever since settling in Pennsylvania in the 1740s. In Blackcoats among the 
                            Delaware
                        , Earl P. Olmstead describes the establishment of Moravian mission towns on the
                    Tuscarawas, the first being Schönbrunn, which today exists as a partially restored
                    historic site. Olmstead does not dwell, however, on the period when the missions flourished in
                    relative tranquility on the Tuscarawas. Instead, his study focuses on the years of disruption during
                    the American Revolution and on later decades when the Moravians struggled to rebuild their missions.
                    Given the interconnectedness of the life of missionary David Zeisberger with most of these stages of
                    Moravian mission development, the book is as much a narrative of Moravian mission work as it is a
                    biography.
            Olmstead devotes a major portion of his story to the years 1798–1821, when the Moravians
                    and a group of Indian converts reestablished a mission on the Tuscarawas and named it 
                        Goshen
                    , having abandoned the area during the Revolution. He also briefly discusses the
                        White River, Indiana, mission, which operated for a short time during this
                    period. Olmstead's study reveals why the Moravian mission records offer such a rich
                    resource for the history of Native Americans and missions. Not only does Olmstead utilize the 
                        Goshen
                     congregation diary to describe daily life in the mission in detail, but he also garners
                    data from the obituaries of each convert buried in the 
                        Goshen
                     cemetery. The information that he offers is tantalizing and calls for even further
                    analysis of topics such as the uses of literacy, Indians' roles as lay assistants,
                    child-rearing practices, and adjustments to mission regulations.
            From reading the missionaries' diaries and letters, though often not in the original German,
                    Olmstead understands important  aspects of the
                    Moravians' worldview and goals. One wishes he had also come to understand the Indians more
                    fully. His descriptions of Indians who had left the mission as "apostates" and of
                    Zeisberger at one point as "the object of the unpredictable and capricious nature of the
                    Indian personality" reveal a failure to uncover Indians' own outlooks (pp. 76,
                    113, 153). Greater attention to the spelling of proper names also would have improved the book.
            Olmstead writes with dedication to and enthusiasm for his task as one who is immersed in the history
                    of the Tuscarawas region. His strength is his ability to draw on this enthusiasm to tell an
                    interesting narrative on an aspect of midwestern history that has not been adequately studied.

            This is a fine collection of essays on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Appalachian history. The
                    essays, many quite short, cover a wide variety of topics including economic, social, cultural, and
                    political history. Although none of the authors discusses Indiana, the essays on 
                  Kentucky, Ohio
               , and the 
                        Virginia
                     and Carolina frontiers might be of use to those interested in the southern background
                    of Indiana's early settlers.
            The collection's central weakness is the lack of a unifying theme. Robert D. 
                        Mitchell
                    's introduction fails to provide a framework linking these disparate pieces.
                    Also lacking in some of the essays is a sense of larger importance. One wonders what the author
                    feels he or she has contributed to a wider understanding of Appalachian society and history. What
                    one does find is a varied collection that explores ethnicity, politics, economics, and settlement.
            Alan V. Briceland begins the collection by painstakingly retracing the paths of the
                    seventeenth-century explorers Thomas Batts and Robert Fallam. Briceland concludes that the two
                    traveled much farther into the 
                        Virginia
                     backcountry than previously believed. Thomas Hatley disputes arguments that
                    characterize Cherokee women as passive, detailing the active role women played in introducing new
                    plants and animals into their traditional agriculture. Sally Schwartz gives a straightforward
                    account of the compromises by which colonial Pennsylvanians achieved religious toleration. Kenneth
                    W. Keller, Richard K. MacMaster, and H. Tyler Blethen and Curtis W. Wood tackle the Celtic thesis of
                         Grady McWhiney and Forrest McDonald. Keller maintains that
                    the Scotch-Irish had been assimilated into a dominant Anglo-American culture by the turn of the
                    nineteenth century. Mac-Master argues that there was no ethnic basis to the cattle breeding business
                    of western 
                        Virginia
                    . The cattle traders were not "Celtic herdsmen" but innovative,
                    profit-oriented businessmen. Blethen and Wood trace the career of one Scotch-Irish Carolina
                    merchant, James Patton. There are essays on Germans in Frederick County, 
                        Maryland
                    , by Elizabeth A. Kessel, land policy and its effect on the settlement of the northern

                    of log houses in eastern 
                        Tennessee
                     by John Morgan. The book closes with three essays, two focusing on 
                        Kentucky
                    , which attempt to explain the economic development of the region. Tyrel G. Moore argues
                    that eastern 
                        Kentucky
                     was not an agrarian region invaded by foreign industry after the Civil War but
                    possessed industry in the antebellum era. Mary Beth Pudup and Paul Salstrom provide fine articles on
                    class and economic development and the relation between agriculture and economic dependency.
            The book has a few proofreading errors which would not be worth noting except that large pieces of
                    transposed text render three pages of Pudup's article on southeast 
                        Kentucky
                     unintelligible.
            On the whole, this is a worthwhile collection of essays of interest to those concerned with a variety
                    of issues in Appalachian social, economic, and political history.

               Fertility Change on the American Frontier: Adaptation and Innovation. By Lee L.
                    Bean, Geraldine P. Mineau, and Douglas L. Anderton. (Berkeley: University of 
                        California
                     Press, 1990. Pp. xiii, 295. Figures, tables, appendix, notes, references, index.
                    $40.00.)
            As its title indicates, this book addresses two basic questions: first, what impact did the frontier
                    have on fertility and, second, which concept best explains the decline of
                    fertility—adaptation (modification of fertility behavior to fit changing conditions) or
                    innovation (adoption of the small family as a new social norm among urban middle classes and
                    diffusion of that norm to lower classes and rural areas).
            Analyzing the extensive 
                        Utah
                     family genealogies housed in the Family History Library in Salt Lake City, the authors
                    conclude  that fertility on the frontier increased to levels not
                    entirely explained by women marrying at younger ages and that married women migrating to the
                    frontier, despite marrying at later ages, bore as many children as 
                        Utah
                    -born women by persisting in child-bearing to older ages. In addition, the authors argue
                    that adaptation was responsible for the subsequent transition to smaller families.
            The authors' individual-level data covering more than a century and their analytical methods
                    provide a consummate picture of initial fertility increase on the 
                        Utah
                     frontier and subsequent decline as settlement progressed. The degree to which the
                    conclusions apply to other frontier populations is less clear. Earlier marriage on other frontiers
                    was an important factor in high fertility, but in 
                        Utah
                    , although not recognized by these authors, the practice of polygamy suppressed
                    women's average marriage age by creating a high demand for wives. Moreover,
                    Mormons' pro-family and millennialist beliefs encouraged a high birth rate. 
                        Utah
                     patterns of fertility may perhaps be similar to those elsewhere, but explanations for
                    those patterns may differ.
            Nor may the authors' rejection of innovation as an explanation of fertility decline be
                    regarded as conclusive, because they make only rudimentary urban-rural, not socioeconomic,
                    distinctions. Consequently, whether lower fertility emerged early among Utahan nonagricultural
                    families and town dwellers, as it did on the Indiana frontier, remains unknown. Nevertheless,
                    Utahans' taking various paths to limited fertility—older ages at marriage,
                    longer intervals between children, and/or cessation of childbirth at earlier
                    ages—mirrored the diverse means of fertility decline among residents of the northern
                    states in 1860. It is, however, uncertain whether this similarity points to adaptation or to
                    alternate strategies for achieving the new social norm of a small family.
            Changing patterns of 
                        Utah
                     fertility may be similar to those elsewhere in the 
                        United States
                    , but to determine that, further research is needed. This book serves as both a
                    challenge and, in general, a model for such research.

            After earning his masters degree and before entering his doctoral program, Michael Allen worked as a
                    towboat deckhand and  cook along the 
                        Mississippi
                     River. Therefore his interest in his topic is more than academic, and his
                    identification with his subjects is more direct than that found in most history books. He wishes to
                    rescue his predecessors from their folkloric reputation as the hardest drinking, hardest fighting,
                    crudest adventurers along the American frontier, not to gild their lilies, but to portray the harsh
                    contours of their bedraggled everyday lives.
            Allen's naturalistic descriptions of his characters, based on thorough archival research,
                    including several previously unused diaries and collections of letters written by the boatmen
                    themselves, are full, vivid, and unromantic. He presents the rough geographical and climatic
                    contexts of the boatmen's lives, their terrible work conditions, their ill health, their
                    illiteracy and ignorance, and their brutish and violent recreations (although on this last point he
                    debunks the overblown tales of eye gouging and knife fighting other writers have taken too
                    literally). He carefully ties the boatmen to the wider economic development of the American
                    heartland. His most original finding is that flatboating increased rather than decreased during the
                    steamboat era and that, with improved skills and a modernized business sense, boatmen adapted to the
                    evolving economy, at least until finally they were eliminated at the same time as the steamboaters
                    by the railroads.
            When he addresses the mythic aspects of his subjects, Allen is less successful. He does outline the
                    alligator horse image by which boatmen were depicted in their own day, including a convincing
                    demonstration of the considerable pride the boatmen took in their folkloric reputation, but he is
                    not very sophisticated about the wider cultural implications of the alligator horse. He suggests
                    vaguely that these were nostalgic wish-fulfillment figures for Jacksonian democrats, without taking
                    into account the origins or purposes of the writers who created them—western Whig
                    businessmen and lawyers on the make—or the nature of their literary market—
                    primarily in the Northeast, where these were figures of fun to be mocked rather than objects of
                    desire. The backwoods battlers had complicated mythic meanings in their own times, which amounted to
                    an important literary reality. Historical analysis has gone beyond the point where one can simply
                    use naturalistic descriptions to dismiss rhetorical figures replete with cultural and even political
                    meanings. Allen's picture of the hard lives of western rivermen is well drawn; his analysis
                    of the wider cultural meanings of the alligator horse is less convincing.

               The Business of Breeding: Hybrid Corn in 
                            Illinois
                        , 1890–1940. By Deborah Fitzgerald. (
                        Ithaca
                     N. Y.: Cornell University Press, 1990. Pp. xi, 247. Notes, illustrations, bibliography,
                    index. $29.95.)
            Deborah Fitzgerald has chosen to study the development of hybrid corn in order to examine the
                    processes by which pure science becomes applied science and to explore the differing roles of the
                    land-grant colleges and private industry in that process. She has consulted the relevant secondary
                    materials and has utilized substantial collections of primary sources at the University of 
                        Illinois
                    , in the National Archives, and in the possession of Funk Brothers, one of the
                    country's leading producers of hybrid seed corn.
            Fitzgerald's readers will learn something of the traditional and scientific means of
                    increasing corn yields through the use of inproved seed, the role of the 
                        United States
                     Bureau of Plant Industry in corn breeding, and the policies of Eugene Davenport, the
                    prominent dean of the 
                        Illinois
                     College of Agriculture and director of the 
                        Illinois
                     Agricultural Experiment Station as he built those agencies during the first decades of
                    the twentieth century. Readers will also become acquainted with the corn improvement activities of
                    the University of 
                        Illinois
                    , especially the sometimes contradictory programs of the Department of Agronomy and the
                    Cooperative Extension Service, with the investigative and promotional work of Funk Brothers, and
                    with the impact of the widespread adoption of hybrid seed by farmers on the relationships between
                    the university and the private firms that produced and marketed most of the seed.
            This sometimes discursive book supplements very well the earlier work of Helen M. Cavenagh, Richard
                    G. Moores, and others. The volume will be of greater interest to historians of science than to
                    historians of agriculture. Fitzgerald is concerned mainly with the process of scientific innovation,
                    with the changing relationships among the agencies engaged in that process, and with the shifting
                    perceptions of those agencies. These are not unimportant matters, but agricultural historians will
                    wish that in addition the author had examined farmers' decisions to abandon open-pollinated
                    varieties of corn, the relationships between the utilization of hybrid seed and the adoption of such
                    other new technology as the mechanical corn picker, and the impact of the almost universal use of
                    the higher yielding varieties by 1940 on the demographics and other characteristics of the rural
                    Middle West.

            This small (just over 100 pages of text), expensive book is a mixed bag. Composed of ten disparate
                    essays, which came out of a 1988 conference in Windsor, 
                        Ontario
                    , commemorating the battle of Lake Erie, the book is perhaps more useful for its
                    bibliographic information than for its substantive essays. The introduction contains a page or two
                    setting the stage for the conference, very short descriptions of the ten essays, and some editorial
                    caveats. Each essay runs about a dozen pages, with the first, by Gerald T. Altoff, giving a short,
                    albeit lively, description of the battle itself. Unfortunately, there are no maps, no diagrams, no
                    illustrations of any kind to assist the reader in understanding the actions. (In fact, it is not
                    until the fourth essay that the reader encounters the book's only map pertaining to the
                    battle.)
            The essay by Frederick C. Drake is a fascinating, if arcane, accounting of the relative artillery
                    strength of the two squadrons, in which Drake concludes that the American commander, Master
                    Commandant Oliver Hazard Perry, not only had superiority in carronades but in long guns as well.
                    Building on this contention, W. A. B. Douglas concludes that Perry's British opposite,
                    Captain Robert Heriot Barclay, and his tiny navy did the best that they could and preserved the
                    "honor of the flag." Dennis Carter-Edwards's essay deals with the
                    strategic necessity of the battle and the consequences of it. He concludes that Barclay had little
                    choice but to fight to reopen the supply channels to 
                        Detroit
                    . Perry and General William Henry Harrison's twin victories cost the British
                    the western end of the Great Lakes, but the Americans were unable to press their advantage further
                    into 
                        Canada
                    . The Indian part in this story is explored in greater depth by R. David Edmunds, who
                    discusses a number of Wyandot, Shawnee, and Potawatomi leaders, most of whom historians have
                    neglected in favor of the Prophet and Tecumseh. To close out the narrative essays, Harold D. Langley
                    discusses the peace process. There is nothing new here, but it is a concise, nicely written
                    explanation of British and American motives and diplomacy.
            The second half of the book consists of a series of historiographical and bibliographical essays from
                    both Canadian and American sources. Ian C.B. Pemberton investigates the works of Canadian scholars.
                    Most defend the conduct of both Barclay and Perry and, with a few exceptions, give them high marks.
                    Christopher McKee, looking at American scholarship, decries the lack of attention given to events of
                    the war on the western Great Lakes.  Several have covered
                    Perry's actions adequately, but few have looked at other American commanders (such as Jesse
                    Elliott), and no one has taken the American seamen into account. The last two authors, Stuart
                    Sutherland and Douglas E. Clanin, have put together two most helpful and seemingly complete
                    bibliographical essays. Sutherland describes the Canadian archives, while Clanin describes and lists
                    the various collections in the 
                        United States
                     containing War of 1812 materials. This book will be invaluable to researchers of the
                    period for these two essays alone.

               Sixty Million Acres: American Veterans and the Public Lands before the Civil
                    War. By James W. Oberly. (
                  Kent, Ohio

                        Kent

                    appendixes, notes, sources, index. $28.00.)
            In this well-focused study, James W. Oberly examines the origin, operation, and effect of land grant
                    bounties in the 1840s and 1850s. In so doing, he provides valuable insights on federal
                    administration of the national domain in the transitional period between the Distribution Act of
                    1841 and the Homestead Act of 1862. Although the underlying intent of established policy remained
                    constant—to transfer public lands to private ownership and facilitate the settlement of
                    new farmers—the assumptions that defined and framed governmental action were altered
                    significantly. Administration officials and Congress had long considered land sales as a source of
                    national revenue. In the late 1840s, Oberly argues, with land sale receipts depressed, government
                    expenditures modest, and customs revenues healthy, the connection between public lands and the
                    public debt attenuated. Politicians and citizens came to view the government as a proprietor, which
                    could dispose of the national domain in order to meet various federal obligations. Accordingly, land
                    grants were used to abet recruitment during the Mexican conflict, reward survivors of past wars,
                    drain swamps, and promote railroads.
            Oberly confines his analysis to a judicious statistical sampling of the sixty million acres of land
                    grants given to American veterans and their heirs from 1847 to 1855. Perhaps mistaking effect for
                    intent, Oberly contends that bounties functioned as a substitute for cash pensions plied from a
                    penurious government by single-interest veterans organizations. Consequently, he concludes that
                    warrants did not prove to be a fillip to western expansion; most assignees sold them for cash. Nor
                    did grant holders who chose to locate their claims travel far, for they generally came from, and
                    took up residence in public land states. Longstanding fears of 
                    speculation, sharping, and land monopolies notwithstanding, Oberly finds that warrant transactions
                    were reasonably equitable, sellers realized handsome profits, and competition among big buyers
                    tended to lower—not raise—acreage prices. In addition, he painstakingly
                    explains the manner in which the warrants were processed and issued by the federal government as
                    well as the way they were used by sellers and settlers in the upper 
                        Mississippi
                     valley.
            Yet to describe is not to explain. Anticipating the corruption of the Gilded Age, Oberly suggests
                    that veterans lobbies, interest-group politics, and congressional land giveaways together signaled
                    "the end of the old republic of 
                        Washington
                    …." Perhaps. Early national and Jacksonian debates over the
                    disposition of the public domain were structured and informed by a political culture defined by the
                    interaction and tension between classical republicanism and nascent liberal capitalism. Oberly,
                    however, roots the land bounty system in opportunism and pragmatism. That the older debate was
                    eclipsed is clear; why it failed to resonate with the public is not. Nor is Oberly's
                    assessment of the dynamics of interest-group politics wholly persuasive. Many Jacksonian scholars
                    contend that the function of antebellum politicians was to identify a hobby and ride it to power:
                    that is, to give the public what it wanted. And by Oberly's own account, the language and
                    arguments employed by veterans organizations were rooted in the assumptions of that political
                    environment.
            The strengths of Oberly's book are many. Its organization, research, and in-depth analysis
                    shed light on a dimly understood, albeit narrow, development in national economic policy. Oberly
                    also provides a number of healthy correctives to assumptions in the extant literature on land usage.
                    Yet the absence of a broader historiographic context and, specifically, the failure to root this
                    policy in the fluid political economy of the 1840s and 1850s, limits understanding of the transition
                    to and popular appeal of the land bounty system. By extension it vitiates Oberly's
                    contribution to the economic history of antebellum America.

            A 
                        Virginia
                    -born slaveholder and career military man once indicted for treason against the 
                        United States
                    , Robert E. Lee somehow  mythically entered the
                    mainstream of American culture. Lee's reservations about slavery, his initial reluctance to
                    fight against the old Union, his audacious military successes in the face of overwhelming odds, his
                    magnanimity, his dutiful persistence, and his final realistic adjustment to defeat appealed to
                    Americans in ways that transcended sectional politics.
            Alan T. Nolan is suspicious of all these claims to national stature made by Lee's partisans
                    over the years. When looked at closely, Nolan argues persuasively, the life of Robert E. Lee appears
                    to be that of a 
                        Virginia
                     planter-aristocrat who was a Pierce Democrat before the war and, during Reconstruction,
                    a supporter of Andrew Johnson and Horatio Seymour. Lee believed that slavery, for all its
                    embarrassing and sorry consequences for whites and blacks alike, ultimately benefited the
                    "African." He always associated the black race with degradation and believed the
                    races were best separated.
            As a general, Lee, though fiercely effective on the battlefield, lacked a grasp of national strategy.
                    The result, Nolan would have readers believe, is that Lee's aggressiveness, and the
                    consequent heavy Confederate casualties, undermined the only grand strategy that might have
                    succeeded for the Confederacy, the obstinate prolongation of conflict until the North lost the
                    political will to fight. In fact, if the Lee legend is read closely, the general's military
                    achievements appear dazzling only if one assumes they were doomed from the start. And his dogged
                    persistence in bloody fighting seems downright inhumane if one believes, as some writers have
                    argued, that Lee knew his cause was militarily hopeless as much as twenty months before 
                        Appomattox
                    . In other words, Nolan says, Robert E. Lee was a rather ordinary southerner with
                    considerable military talent who honored his privileged birth with an irrational or unthinking
                    devotion to duty.
            The evidence for this revised portrait is solid—mostly Lee's own
                    words—but slender. Lee seldom wrote about politics and rarely articulated his national
                    vision. Nolan makes the most of the few letters where such subjects arise, but Lee was neither a
                    politician nor visionary. He was a man of action, and to cross-examine his skimpy intellectual
                    testimony is to judge him by a part of the record where even Lee's partisans have always
                    admitted weakness: the general could rarely write with eloquence or verve.
            Lee's actions, however, embodied an eloquence that persuaded even his military adversaries
                    of his greatness, and the core of the myth may survive Nolan's attack because he chose to
                    look more at Lee's words than his behavior.

            James W. Geary's well-researched, well-written, and well-illustrated inquiry into the
                    operations of the Federal draft system during the Civil War is worthy of high praise. His account
                    covers the entire Union from 1861 to 1865 but has special appeal for those interested in the
                    situation in Indiana. Although Hoosiers made massive contributions to the Union war effort, their
                    collective and individual adherence to the cause was neither as unqualified nor as enthusiastic as
                    some historians have suggested. The state's ferociously partisan Governor Oliver P. Morton
                    was accused of selling Indiana's naval recruitment credits to maritime 
                        Massachusetts
                    . Women in the state were vocal in their opposition to the draft after the bloodbath at 
                        Fredericksburg
                    . In October, 1863, part of the Indiana quota was met by the enlistment en
                        masse of 150 Confederate deserters and prisoners of war. Home guard personnel were
                    reluctant to serve in Federal army units in 1864 because they feared an outbreak of guerrilla
                    activity in their home districts. On several occasions Union recruiting agents were attacked, and at
                    least one, in 
                        Brown
                     County, was murdered. Prior to the general election of 1864 Schuyler Colfax of Indiana,
                    speaker of the 
                        United States
                     House of Representatives, counseled President Abraham Lincoln to furlough Indiana
                    regiments so that they might vote at home and advised the president to keep
                    "pending" the draft in the state before polling day. During a special draft
                    designed to free seasoned troops from garrison duty, the Hoosier state distinguished itself by
                    having the greatest deficiency among participating states—a whopping 64 percent.
            To be sure, the author is correct in emphasizing the difficulties the Federal conscription program
                    experienced in Indiana. His final judgment, however, is that the draft was not quite as successful
                    anywhere as earlier historians have suggested. Once the volunteer enthusiasm of the first months of
                    conflict had evaporated, Lincoln and his civilian and military coadjutors were hard put to it to
                    keep the ranks of the Union army filled by the unprecedented conscription method or the threat of
                    it. And despite the problems faced by the Lincoln administration in raising men in Indiana and
                    elsewhere, one cannot deny that approximately 200,000 Hoosiers—out of a military manpower
                    pool of perhaps 300,000 and a total population of roughly 1.35 million—served (some in
                    multiple enlistments) in the Union army and home guard.
            An extensive bibliography of archival and printed sources bears witness to the thoroughness of the
                    author's research. Two  sections of illustrations offer
                    contemporary views of recruiting stations and officials, their clientele, bounty jumpers, and other
                    players in the deadly game.

            Seven essays on social developments in the North during and after the Civil War comprise the contents
                    of this slender volume. Maris A. Vinovskis's central purpose is to provide examples of work
                    "that can and should be done" (p. vii). Of the seven pieces, only his
                    "Have Social Historians Lost the Civil War? Some Preliminary Demographic
                    Speculations" has appeared previously. The substance of the remaining essays are derived
                    from master theses and dissertations by "scholars in their twenties and thirties"
                    (p. vii). He finds that this age factor is important because it "suggests that the next
                    generation of scholars will pay more attention to the social history of the Civil War than have
                    their predecessors" (p. vii).
            Vinovskis's call for more emphasis on social history is hardly new. Almost two decades ago,
                    Eric Foner in an essay in Civil War History admonished both political and social
                    historians of the era to give more attention to each other's area of interest. Among those
                    who have done so are Iver Bernstein, Joseph T. Glatthaar, Randall C. Jimerson, Philip Shaw Paludan,
                    Judith Lee Hallock, and Emily J. Harris.
            Vinovskis's splendid and provocative article on demography definitely warrants reading.
                    Among the remaining essays that contain major findings are Amy Holmes's study of Union
                    widows and Stuart McConnell's analysis of Union veterans who joined the Grand Army of the
                    Republic in the postwar era. Some of the other case studies are not as important or relevant. For
                    example, Reid 
                        Mitchell
                    's discussion of the influence that home had on the discipline and bravery of
                    Union soldiers and the difficulties that officers experienced in maintaining distance between
                    themselves and enlisted men who were their neighbors at home are subjects that have been treated
                    earlier by Gerald F. Linderman. One wonders too why the editor chose to include Robin
                    Einhorn's, "The Civil War and Municipal Government in 
                        Chicago
                    " in a work on social history when Harris's excellent article on
                    Deerfield, 
                        Massachusetts
                    , would have been more in keeping with the volume's spirit and intent. Finally,
                    none of the essays treats significantly the  war's
                    effect on African Americans, a surprising omission given the war's far-reaching social
                    impact on this particular group.
            The main value of Toward a Social History of the Civil War lies in providing
                    additional information about the war through more case studies. Although Vinovskis provides an
                    excellent point of departure for stimulating further interest with his "Preliminary
                    Demographic Speculations," this same level of thought-provoking inquiry is not sustained in
                    the rest of the volume. Rather the book is more a compilation of case studies than exploratory
                    essays. Only Civil War historians who specialize in social history will find it of interest. Had
                    this work contained at least a bibliographical essay, which discussed the major works on the
                    war's social history and identified areas for further study, its value and utility for
                    undergraduate classes and the general reader would have been enhanced greatly.

            Kenneth Marvin 
                        Hamilton
                     relates the history of five of sixty-four documented black towns in the
                    trans-Appalachian West between 1877 and 1915. While the book's sub-title implies broader
                    coverage, the five towns he studies were located in the trans-
                        Mississippi
                     West. They are Nicodemus, 
                        Kansas
                    ; Mound Bayou, 
                        Mississippi
                    ; Langston City and Boley, 
                        Oklahoma
                    ; and Allensworth, 
                        California
                    . A chapter is devoted to each town.
            
               
                        Hamilton
                     discusses black town development as an entrepreneurial enterprise. This is in contrast
                    to the traditional literature which largely deals with the ideological aspects of the subject. 
                        Hamilton
                     concludes that the patterns of founding and developing black towns were essentially
                    similar to those of white towns during the period. The developers of black town sites were primarily
                    motivated by an interest in profit. The activities used to promote black towns paralleled those used
                    to promote white towns. Promoters of black towns used newspaper advertisements, round-trip railroad
                    excursions to the development site, promotional literature, and other techniques commonly used in
                    town development at the time. Likewise, the typical black town developer tried to obtain vital
                    railroad connections to the town site, investments in local business and industry, and support for
                    the town's educational and community institutions.
            
            While emphasizing the similarities in the promotion and development of black towns and white towns,
                    the author minimizes the role of race in this history. 
                        Hamilton
                     states, "America's racial ideology produced few notable differences
                    in the early evolution of black towns and their white and biracial counterparts" (p. 152).
                    Yet information contained in his book indicates that race was clearly an important factor in black
                    town history. Black nationalist philosophy was featured in promotional literature, and it appealed
                    directly to persons having a black separatist ideology. The fortunes of black towns were affected by
                    the disinclination of white railroad magnates, industrialists, bankers, government officials, and
                    farmers to do business with blacks in the years before 1915.
            Nevertheless, students of black business history will find Black Towns and Profit
                    to be a valuable scholarly work using a variety of primary sources including railroad company
                    records. The considerable secondary literature on the topic is discussed at length in a
                    bibliographic essay (Appendix Two). This unusual volume also contains much of interest to the
                    general reader. Hoosier readers will note that no Indiana sites are listed in Appendix One,
                    "Black Towns in the Trans-Appalachian West," thereby ignoring places like the
                    Roberts settlement and Lyles Station.

               Promise to the Land: Essays on Rural Women. By Joan M. Jensen. (Albuquerque:

               Promise to the Land is a collection of essays, first started in 1977, by Joan M.
                    Jensen. Half of the essays have been previously published; one essay is co-authored with Susan
                    Armitage. The book is divided into five sections, which include traditional subjects such as rural
                    history but also new topics such as rural social welfare. The essays cover the activities of farm
                    women in a wide geographical area including 
                        New York
                    , Pennsylvania, 
                  Wisconsin, Maryland, Washington
               , and 
                        New Mexico
                    . They also touch a wide variety of ethnic groups including the Seneca Indians,
                    Hispanics, African-American slaves, and even the life of a Lithuanian immigrant farm woman. They
                    further cover a wide array of work areas such as picking hops, making butter, and keeping boarders.
                    In the introduction Jensen writes, "The study of women in agricultural development begins
                    with the inescapable reality that women have seldom had control over the land they have labored
                    on" (p. 1). Jensen returns to this observation again and again as she deals with women in
                    different regions and in different areas of agricultural production.
            
            While not all essays are equally well developed, Jensen's work denonstrates a remarkable
                    diversity of scholarship and writing. Several of the essays are personal, relating the lives of the
                    author's mother and grandmother and the author's life in a commune. Several essays
                    discuss research methods such as oral history and the use of iconography and material culture; these
                    essays are intended as models for other scholars who work in this field. Throughout, the essays
                    present significant findings on rural women across the entire nation. Jensen frequently reiterates
                    the fact that much more work needs to be done in this area and that nontraditional methods of
                    research will have to be used since rural women often did not leave written records.
            Jensen's essays represent a treasure trove of material on American rural women. A pioneer in
                    this field, Jensen writes with authority and understanding. Her book will now be the starting point
                    for anyone interested in the subject. The reader will find not only a rich source of information but
                    also suggestions of ways to continue research in the field.

            Though both of these books focus on the ideas that motivated and sustained the American settlement
                    house movement, Rivka Shpak Lissak and Mina Carson have very different stories to tell.
                    Lissak's, the more controversial, claims that the most influential settlement in the 
                        United States
                    , Hull House, was "designed to perpetuate the existing social order"
                    (p. 22), that Jane Addams and 
                        Chicago
                    's "Liberal Progressives" tried and failed to "force
                    their leadership…upon both ‘new immigrants’ and their
                    leaders" (p. 76), and that they had as their "ultimate objective…the
                    dissolution of the ethnic group" (p. 131). Carson, by contrast, while acknowledging
                    conflicts between settlement leaders’ motives of social control and their ideals for
                    "social democracy," concludes that Addams and some other leaders "made
                    imaginative and influential contributions to new conceptions of cultural pluralism that
                    recognized…‘immigrant gifts’ to American society" (p.
                    197). Carson sees settlements as the embodiment of a religious conviction of  "the value of every human life and its vital connection to
                    every other human life" (p. 198).
            Lissak's book is based on her 1981 doctoral dissertation at the Hebrew University of
                    Jerusalem, and it reflects the 1970s spirit of ethnic pride, even militance. (It also reflects that
                    decade's and earlier scholarship; there are only seven references to post-1981 work, two of
                    which are references to Lissak's own articles.) In Lissak's view ethnics were
                    united in their determination not to become assimilated into American society; any apparent
                    differences among immigrants within a given ethnicity were insignificant; only
                    "marginal" ethnics were interested in assimilation, and they were few. Horace
                    Kallen's view of cultural pluralism—i.e., that the ethnic group was and should
                    be the fundamental unit of the society—she takes to be self-evidently right and the
                    standard by which all views toward ethnics should be measured.
            Lissak finds a similar unity in the "Liberal Progressives," the group of 
                        Chicago
                     social workers and intellectuals she indicts in her book. Despite their apparent value of diversity and respect for immigrant cultures, Lissak concludes that
                    ultimately these people were anti-ethnic because they viewed the individual rather than the ethnic
                    group as the fundamental unit of society and because they aimed toward an eventual cosmopolitan
                    unity in the ongoing creation of an American national culture. Lissak's view is that anyone
                    who is not "for" ethnic segregation is anti-ethnic.
            Lissak's book is provocative and bellicose (the derisory adjective
                    "so-called" rings like a leitmotiv through the volume), but her evidence often
                    does not support her conclusions. Chapter Seven, for example, attempts to show that Hull House
                    failed "even to become an important source of influence to the younger generation of
                    immigrants" (p. 122); evidence there and elsewhere (pp. 85, 99, 122) suggests instead that
                    Jewish and Italian social centers were organized to counter the Americanizing influence of Hull
                    House. Lissak regularly fails to recognize ambiguity and problems of evidence, relying without
                    comment, for example, upon the self-serving accounts of elderly ethnics to prove that Hull House was
                    ineffective in its efforts to assimilate immigrants. She simply ignores critiques of cultural
                    pluralism by John Higham, Arthur Mann, and Stephan Thernstrom, among others.
            Carson's book, based on her doctoral dissertation at 
                        Harvard
                     (1984), is more finely tuned in its analysis. She concentrates on two basic themes: (1)
                    the foundation of the settlement movement in the Victorian idealization of individual character as
                    the key to social progress and (2) the radically fluid "method" of the
                    settlements, which was an infinite confidence in the efficacy of friendly face-to-face interaction
                    between individuals of different classes. Carson acknowledges and examines the contradictions within
                    the movement: the tension between a commitment to democracy and 
                    a belief in social science and expertise; between respect for other cultures and cultural/class
                    chauvinism; between fostering the immigrant family's authority and usurping that authority
                    by intervening between the generations. But, whereas for Lissak these tensions inevitably signify
                    that Addams was really anti-democratic and anti-immigrant, for Carson settlements
                    can be seen as agents of both social control and social democracy, since the
                    process of interaction subsumes both elements.
            
               Settlement Folk is an intelligent study of an important social movement led
                    preponderantly by women. Because Carson speaks, like the settlement folk themselves, in quiet tones
                    with a tolerance for complexity and ambiguity, her nuanced book may be overshadowed by
                    Lissak's account. That would be a shame.

                    presidents to build a modern university. Three administrators stand out: Walter Jessup, who built up
                    the university in the 1920s; Virgil Hancher, whose "inertial" policies crippled
                    the school after World War II (he strongly disliked educational innovators such as Indiana
                    University's Herman B Wells); and Howard R. Bowen, who began a revival in the 1960s.
                    Special chapters focus on the influential graduate dean Carl Seashore, on the rise of the medical
                    college, and on efforts to reform undergraduate education.
            Conceptually, Persons identifies three periods of development at the University of 
                        Iowa
                    . The earliest, beginning with the founding of the school, was characterized by
                    capricious management and lack of purpose. Individuals inside and outside the university showed
                    little understanding of the institution. The distinction between policy making and administration
                    was not understood by regents or lawmakers; no one grasped the significance of delegated authority.
                    During the second stage, institutional forms developed. The situation was ripe for
                    "creative anarchy" as aggressive individuals 
                    seized the opportunity to build their own programs within the institution. They laid the foundations
                    for the university's lasting strengths in psychology, literature, creative writing, the
                    arts, physics, speech, and medicine. The last stage—institutional inertia—
                    emerged at midcentury. The university had become thoroughly stabilized, running on its own momentum.
            Although Persons's book will have special meaning for anyone who has known the University of 
                        Iowa
                    , it deserves a far wider audience. The writing is lively, laconic, and graceful. The
                    author's long affiliation with the university does not dull his critical perceptions.
                    Students of American higher education will find valuable comparative data in his description of the
                    problems of interinstitutional rivalry and the struggles of departmentalists versus generalists and
                    interdisciplinarians versus specialists. The description of the impact of the 
                        Vietnam
                     War on academe is among the best yet written. In short, Persons has set a high standard
                    for future institutional studies in American higher education.

            State histories are a difficult genre for writer and reader alike. The focus should not be so narrow
                    as to be parochial nor so broad as to minimize the distinctiveness of the state's
                    experience. This volume, the penultimate in the series, generally succeeds in steering between those
                    opposing tendencies.
            Paul W. Glad begins with World War I, an event that transcended state boundaries. The strong German
                    ethnic community in the Badger state, however, divided 
                        Wisconsin
                     more sharply than did ethnic diversity in most other states. Senator Robert La Follette
                    opposed 
                        United States
                     involvement in the war and subsequently opposed the draft, earning President Woodrow
                    Wilson's scorn as one of "a little group of willful men, representing no opinion
                    but their own" (p. 21). Later, when Milwaukee elected socialist Victor Berger to the House
                    of Representatives, Congress refused to seat him. Even though many Wisconsinites would have
                    preferred neutrality, when war came the University of 
                        Wisconsin
                     sent more of its faculty to serve as officers in the war than did any other university.
            The Red Scare that ushered in the New Era of the 1920s did not divide the state nearly as much as had
                    the war nor as much as  would prohibition and women's
                    suffrage. Milwaukee breweries that catered to German immigrant traditions accommodated to the
                    Eighteenth Amendment by switching to production of low- or nonalcoholic beverages. They had earlier
                    joined Catholics and Lutherans in a losing battle against women's suffrage, fearing that a
                    large influx of female voters would assure prohibition. Glad also discusses how the Ku Klux
                    Klan's demands for immigration restriction contributed to an influx of African Americans
                    from the South in response to industrialists' recruiting efforts.
            
               
                        Wisconsin
                     has justifiably prided itself on its state university, which achieved considerable
                    national prominence for its activism during the Progressive Era. During the New Era, the
                    university's College of Agriculture played an important role in bringing scientific
                    applications to the state's farmers. Patent income from its research faculty contributed to
                    the development of one of the first university research foundations. WHA, the university's
                    radio station, extended education to isolated hamlets, villages, and farms.
            The dominant personalities of the book are the La Follettes— father and sons. While they
                    accomplished major reforms, Glad points out how their progressive rhetoric also contributed to class
                    consciousness and interest-group politics. During his three terms as governor, Philip evolved an
                    imaginative program to meet the challenge of the Depression. His administration often anticipated
                    New Deal policies and occasionally contributed to tensions with 
                        Franklin
                     D. Roosevelt, who tended toward less radical solutions in an effort to keep his New
                    Deal coalition intact.
            While the author places 
                        Wisconsin
                     in the larger national perspective, he seldom sees the state in a regional framework.
                    He succeeds, however, in giving the reader a solid understanding of events that have profoundly
                    shaped the recent history of the state.

                    James Curtis. (

            Cameras do lie. Today's computer imaging technology simply extends previous photographic
                    manipulation. Whether it be the "ghosts" seen in nineteenth-century double
                    exposures or the recent 
                        New York
                    
                    Times image of Sylvester Stallone as "Rocky" posing with 
                        Franklin
                     D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Groucho Marx at Yalta,
                    photography—"the mirror with the memory"—does not always
                    depict reality in a truthful manner.
            
            In Mind's Eye, Mind's Truth, James Curtis examines the work of
                    four of the world's most celebrated photographers. Employed by Roy Stryker for the Farm
                    Security Administration (FSA), they traveled across the 
                        United States
                     documenting the impact of the Great Depression and World War II on the lives of
                    everyday Americans. Curtis contends that the results were not inherently objective renderings but
                    subjective, artistic creations; in his words, "deliberate images" that conformed
                    to urban, middle-class values.
            That photographers compose and edit the scenes they are shooting is a given. That others, whether
                    Stryker, his staff, or anyone using the vast FSA Collection of the Library of Congress, may select,
                    crop, interpret, and even misread the photographs is also self-evident. That the FSA photographers
                    deliberately acted in ways suggested by Curtis is conjecture, a point underscored by his continual
                    use of such terms as "apparently," "may have,"
                    "perhaps," and "more likely." While this is not a
                    "neo-obscurantist" work, the major contribution is the excellent quality of the
                    reproductions not the labored attempts by Curtis to explain the captioned FSA photographs.
            Dorothea Lange's 1936 image at a pea picker's camp near Nipomo, 
                        California
                    , may be the best-known black-and-white image ever taken. "Migrant
                    Mother" has come to symbolize stoic determination amid great adversity. Curtis tells us
                    that Lange selected this image from a series of six, noting that the father and four of the
                    family's seven children are not depicted. He concludes that Lange sought to create a
                    "transcendent image" by deciding what to feature and what to leave out. Walker
                    Evans, considered the most artistic by the author, moved objects and deliberately set his camera
                    angle to eliminate unwanted items as he filmed the austere life of three tenant families in 
                        Alabama
                    . Arthur Rothstein staged his image, "Fleeing a Dust Storm," to
                    photograph a farmer and his two sons leaning into the 
                        Oklahoma
                     wind. An earlier incident created a fury of publicity when Rothstein moved a
                    steer's skull in the Badlands.
            While these understandings help to place the FSA images, considered to be cultural icons of the
                    1930s, into historical context, misinterpretations and errors seriously limit this book. The author
                    repeats Stryker's statement that he never took a picture. Yet the series Russell Lee took
                    in 
                        Minnesota
                    , which Curtis discusses at some length, includes several images by Stryker that can be
                    found in the FSA collection. Perhaps most revealing is Curtis's analysis of Lee's
                    1939 series from San Augustine, 
                        Texas
                    . Curtis contends that images of the "closed society of 
                        Texas
                     politics" were manipulated to depict the democratic character of smalltown
                    America. Specifically, Lee used "a wide angle perspective to demonstrate the size of the
                    crowd and to imply a high degree of citizen participation in local government…. Had Lee
                    taken this picture from the balcony,

                    seats, the effect would have been totally different" (p. 109). A careful review of other
                    photographs taken that day reveal that the image in question served to diminish, not enhance, the
                    size of the crowd. Moreover, black members of the community sat in the balcony while the county
                    commissioners sat in the jury box on the main floor. Cameras may be used to manipulate, and
                    photographers do not always record objective facts. Historians are no less immune to criticism for
                    misreading the evidence.

               The Beginnings of a New National Historic Preservation Program, 1957 to 1969. By

                    bibliography, index. Paper-bound, $9.95.)
            Relying heavily on archival material and interviews with key participants, James A. Glass has
                    produced a fascinating, "inside-the-beltway" look at the origins of the national
                    historic preservation program. Glass has filled a significant gap for anyone interested in the
                    origins of a public policy that has helped revitalize cities and towns across the nation. He has
                    also set the stage for further analysis of the federal role in a major movement in twentieth-century
                    architecture.
            This slim volume, an outgrowth of Glass's 1987 dissertation at Cornell, focuses on the
                    passage of the National Historic Preservation Act (1966). Most preservationists know the act from
                    the protections it affords historic places from any adverse federal action, from the matching grants
                    to states for development of historic sites, and from the act's expansion of the National
                    Register of Historic Places. Glass, now director of the Indiana Division of Historic Preservation
                    and Archaeology, reveals that the genesis of the act and its subsequent implementation can be traced
                    to high-level activism bolstered by the threat of urban renewal, an interstate highway system, and a
                    renewed interest in the disposal or replacement of historic federal properties. The well-intentioned
                    "preservation community" of the period was no match for the billions of dollars
                    fueling the federal bulldozer. If the nation's man-made heritage were to survive, it became
                    obvious in the late 1950s and early 1960s that the answer rested with the very federal government
                    that posed the greatest harm. How the wheels began to turn in the other direction, Glass argues, was
                    partly the product of the environmentalism  of the Kennedy,
                    Johnson, and Nixon administrations.
            Glass begins with the intriguing story of how the congressional committee headed by Albert M. Rains
                    acted as a catalyst for the changes embodied in the 1966 National Historic Preservation Act. Glass
                    skillfully pieces together how committee members laid the groundwork for the legislation and saw it
                    through its infancy. He also shows how the committee brought together the first generation of
                    leaders for the modern preservation movement. With liberal access to their files—as well
                    as seventeen interviews—Glass reveals how the historians, architects, and planners framed
                    the "new" preservation, an approach that stresses the broad patterns of
                    architectural significance over the "greatness" of isolated landmarks.
            Glass is the first to admit the shortcomings of his work. Time, money, and restricted access to vital
                    private records limited his analysis in places. But the broad sweep of his effort is as solid as his
                    contribution to the field.

                    historian whose family has designed and managed cemeteries for four generations, Sloane is uniquely
                    qualified for his task.
            Drawing upon a vast array of primary sources, Sloane describes an "American mosaic of
                    death" characterized by "a vast diversity of…burial customs and burial
                    places." Nevertheless, this mosaic has a "discernable pattern" (p. 1).
                    Until the early nineteenth century most Americans were interred in isolated frontier graves, family
                    farm graveyards, churchyards, or potters' fields. But shortly after the Revolution the
                    first of four overlapping American cemetery models began to emerge.
            Between the 1790s and the 1850s the dominant mode was the urban cemetery, typified by the 
                        New Haven
                     Burying Ground. Normally situated inside the municipal boundary, it usually was family-
                    or government-owned, managed by a sexton, and featured a formal garden design with stone and marble
                    markers and sculpture.  During the 1830s the rural cemetery,
                    located outside the city limits and inspired by Mount 
                        Auburn
                     Cemetery in 
                  Cambridge, Massachusetts
               , emerged. Privately owned and
                    frequently managed by a superintendent, it was picturesque but economically inefficient, with
                    serpentine roadways, wide pathways, and large marble and granite markers and monuments. While the
                    rural cemetery prevailed into the 1870s, it was eclipsed soon thereafter by the suburban lawn-park,
                    typified by Spring Grove Cemetery in 
                        Cincinnati
                    . This model was marked by a pastoral landscape featuring large lots, artistic use of
                    water, and markers set close to the ground. Its entrepreneurial ownership stressed management by a
                    professional superintendent well versed in cemetery design and maintenance. The lawn-park yielded in
                    the 1920s to the memorial park. Modeled on Forest Lawn in Glendale, 
                        California
                    , the memorial park retained the pastoral and entrepreneurial character of the
                    lawn-park, but it rejected three-dimensional markers in favor of ground level markers and central
                    sculptures. Management also aggressively promoted pre-need lot sales.
            Reinforcing Sloane's typology is his close attention to the conceptual context, including
                    changing religious and social attitudes about death, developments in landscape architecture,
                    advances in disease theory, the rise of the funeral industry and cremation, and other forces that
                    influenced the American way of death.
            This otherwise excellent volume has the footnotes at the rear rather than at the bottom of the page
                    where they belong, and on page 105 the word "Perspective" is used where
                    "Prospective" is meant. Despite these quibbles Sloane has produced an outstanding
                    contribution to the scholarship of the American urban landscape.
