                            <l>Then it spoke no more, but walked a little behind me and silent, at
                                my side,</l>
                            <l>While the fever and the dull pain in my breast were there to remind

                            <l>Then I cried and prayed in my agony, but for a long time always in

                            <l>It seeks not to clutch me as of old with passionate eagerness,</l>

                            Atalanta was the daughter of Schoenus. The Delphic oracle had warned her

                            their love the temple of Cybelet and were metamorphosed into lions and
