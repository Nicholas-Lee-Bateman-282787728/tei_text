                <head>PREFACE.</head>
                <p><hi>POETRY</hi> has ever been a transcript of those impressions made upon the
                    human mind by scenes and circumstances, sentiments and emotions; which, while
                    they are common to human nature in general, familiarity cannot vulgarize, nor
                    critical examination deprive of intensity and interest. This transcript, when
                    made with simplicity and faithfulness, has invariably found an answer in the
                    human heart; for as the ear naturally delights in music, and, when deprived of
                    the enjoyment which music affords, feels an indescribable longing for the
                    refreshment of melodious sounds; so naturally do the feelings of the heart
                    expand and exult in that higher and more<pb n="vi" xml:id="VAB7162-002"/>
                    exquisite music of the mind, conveyed at once to the understanding and the
                    affections, through the medium of poetry.</p>
                <p>Such being the case, it seems impossible, so long as human beings think and feel,
                    observe and experience, that poetry should vanish from the earth. There are,
                    however, states of society, and stages of civilization, in which it appears to
                    be less acceptable than in others; and popular opinion has pronounced upon the
                    present time as being peceuliarly unpropitious to the gratification of poetic
                    taste; nor would the apparent presumption of sending forth a poem at such a
                    time, and from such a pen as mine, be sufficiently justified, but for the
                    peculiar views I have been led to entertain on the subject of poetry as it
                    exists at the present day.</p>
                <p>It appears to me, that public taste has not yet recovered from a series of
                    over-excitements, produced in rapid succession, by the legends of Scott, the
                    lyrics of Moore, and the deep and more impassioned strains of Byron. All, or
                    nearly all, the poets who have followed these, have attempted to follow in the
                    same course; until the flowers—and they were many—which grew beside their path,
                    have been trodden<pb n="vii" xml:id="VAB7162-003"/> down by the pressure of
                    numerous feet; and from the very frequency and familiarity with which such
                    subjects have been presented to our view, chivalry has lost its romance, love
                    and beauty have almost ceased to charm, and passion has raved itself to
                    death.</p>
                <p>Does it then follow, that poetry must die also? Let us not admit the thought of
                    such a stigma falling upon our country, or our age. One thing, however, is
                    necessary; and it has been overlooked by almost all who have lately attempted to
                    write poetry.</p>
                <p>After the over-excitement which created so false and unnatural a taste has
                    entirely subsided, we must return to nature, and simplicity. It is more than
                    probable that many will return in vain, beeause the ear long accustomed to the
                    higher symphonies of genius, will scarcely condescend, for some time at least,
                    to listen to the humbler melody of simple bards. But nature must prevail at
                    last; and whatever the event of the experiment I have made may be, its failure
                    or success will in no way affect my conviction, that by returning to
                    simplicity—by making simplicity without weakness or puerility the constant
                    companion of his studies, the poet who is true to nature may<pb n="viii" xml:id="VAB7162-004"/> yet find acceptance with intelligent and feeling
                    minds.</p>
                <p>In the “Poetry of Life,” I have endeavoured to prove that four qualifications are
                    necessary for an able and successful poet—power, imagination, impression, and
                    taste. To only one of these—a capability for receiving lively and lasting
                    impressions, do I make any pretension: yet such is my confidence in the power of
                    simplicity and truth, that I commit my poem to the public, not doubting but
                    there will be found amongst that public some whose experience will testify to
                    its faithfulness, and more whose hear will respond to its truth. It contains no
                    exaggerated statements. I know that such things are, as I have here
                    described.</p>
                <p>It has suited my purpose, amongst other illustrations, to have actual
                    representations made of the home of my childhood, as well as of my father's
                    present residence; but in making this confession, I should wish to have it
                    clearly understood, that the representation of real scenes extends no farther.
                    The description of the habits of the farmer's family, as well the conduct of his
                    landlord, has arisen entirely out the imagination of the writer; and, in the
                    latter case<pb n="ix" xml:id="VAB7162-005"/> especially, would be very unjustly
                    regarded as a specimen of the conduct of landed proprietors in general.</p>
                <p>I cannot, in the usual manner, explain my reasons for selecting the subject which
                    occupies the following pages; because, instead of saying that I have chosen it,
                    I must say that it is almost ever present to my mind. The story is adventitious,
                    and has arisen out of the popular evils of the day; but some of the scenes I
                    have attempted to describe are such as are well calculated to force themselves
                    into verse; and if they fail to present to others the same vivid colouring which
                    distinguishes them amongst my early associations, the fault is in the writer, as
                    a poet—not in the rural scenes of England, as a subject for poetry. Indeed, it
                    has been chiefly when contemplating such scenes, and the habits and feelings of
                    those who are connected with them, that I have renewed my confidence in the
                    conviction, that poetry never can become extinct.</p>
                <p>It is the fashion of the day to overlook, as unworthy of attention, much that is
                    connected with the happiness and misery of social life; and to bring every
                    effort of industry and mental application to<pb n="x" xml:id="VAB7162-006"/>
                    bear upon the machinery of mere animal existence. In conformity with the same
                    mode of thinking, we hear perpetually of our national prosperity being
                    calculated in exact proportion with our commerce, and with the competition
                    England is enabled to maintain with the markets abroad. Thus we are too much
                    disposed to forget, that the real prosperity of a nation ought to be calculated
                    by its elevation in the scale of moral feeling, rather than by its facility in
                    supplying the bodily wants of the community at large.</p>
                <p>That much of this true elevation of feeling belong to the agricultural classes,
                    no one can deny who has become familiarized with their social and domestic
                    habits; and it ought to be esteemed as highest amongst the many privileges of
                    rural life, that the circumstances in which the farmer is placed have a natural
                    tendency to induce a tone of feeling, the value of which can never be computed
                    by the greatest physical advantages this world is able to supply.</p>
                <p>In his association with the more laborious classes, the agriculturist is placed
                    on a footing very different from that of the manufacturer. The simple fact, that
                    in one case the workiing people are called “men,” and in the other “hands,”
                    implies of itself a wide <choice>
                        <orig>dif-</orig>
                        <reg>difference</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="xi" xml:id="VAB7162-007"/> ference. To the manufacturer, they
                    are, for the most part, but instruments of labour—mere hands; and they are taken
                    into his employment when trade is said to be brisk, and dismissed when he needs
                    them no more, just as so many tools are taken up, or laid aside, to suit the
                    service of the day.</p>
                <p>But the farmer dwells, as it wrere, amongst his own people. He has most probably
                    grown up from infancy beside them. His children may have been playmates with
                    theirs. He knows all the internal economy of the cottages around him. His people
                    come to him for advice in their domestic and social transactions; and he feels,
                    too sensibly for his peace of mind, that when his own altered circumstances
                    render it necessary for him to dismiss any of them from his service, that
                    distress, which he is well able to picture, will cast a gloom over the humble
                    abodes, and darken the cheerful hearths, whose evening glow has so often
                    imparted gladness to his heart. He does not hear of this distress as of the
                    visitation of some public calamity diffused amonost an unknown multitude; but he
                    is acquainted with its every feature, and in a manner compelled to trace it
                    home; to picture to his mind the well-known countenances of<pb n="xii" xml:id="VAB7162-008"/> those who sutfer, and to hear the individual voices
                    that have so often responded to his own, deepened into the tones of bitterest
                    complaint.</p>
                <p>It is almost impossible but that this kind of intimate association should produce
                    a degree of mutual interest and fellow-feeling, highly advantageous to both
                    parties in their intercourse with each other; and it seems equally reasonable to
                    conclude, that circumstances of a similar nature should attach the same people
                    to their native country in a more than ordinary manner. The mechanic, or the
                    worker in manufactories, dwells, for the most part, in towns, where nothing but
                    the house he inhabits—sometimes the single chamber he occupies—can be called his
                    own; and that only for a week, a month, a year, or a short term of years, as the
                    fluctuations of trade may render necessary, or desirable. He leaves his lodgings
                    as a traveller leaves his inn, if not quite as often, at any rate with as little
                    regret, except so far as the inconveniences of a removal may affect his comfort.
                    But the agricultural labourer has a feeling of property, not only in his own
                    cottage and garden, but in his master's farm—in the scenes of his boyish
                    rambles, in the fields he has been accustomed to<pb n="xiii" xml:id="VAB7162-009"/> cultivate, the trees he has planted, and, above all,
                    the animals he has watched and fed for his master's use. His children, himself,
                    and his parents have, in many cases, been born in the same parish. He feels an
                    interest in the very soil on which they have grown and flourished. And if this
                    be the case with the poor labourer, how powerful must be the same feeling in the
                    mind of his employer, whose attachment to the soil may reasonably be supposed to
                    bear a relative proportion to the property he holds.</p>
                <p>Modes of thinking peculiar to the present day have rendered somewhat obsolete the
                    old-fashioned virtue of patriotism; and I am quite willing to admit, that the
                    widest expansion of enlightened benevolence must carry out the views of the
                    philanthropist to the utmost range of human existence; but until the mind is
                    thus enlightened, it is certainly better that the benevolent affections should
                    extend to a village, a district, or a whole country, than that they should never
                    be awakened at all. And if we admit patriotism to be a virtue, I feel little
                    hesitation in saying, that it exists in all its genuine simplicity and force
                    amongst those whose local interests have taken deepest root in their native
                    soil.</p>
                <pb n="xiv" xml:id="VAB7162-010"/>
                <p>It is not my desire so far to oveistretch the point of merit, as to attempt to
                    prove that the agricultural classes, in any thing that relates to their
                    religious advancement, are at all superior to the rest of the community. I am
                    even prepared to admit, that there is less fervency of religious zeal, and
                    certainly less religious kuowledge diffused amongst them as a body; but, in
                    admitting this, I must not forget how much less has been done for them than for
                    others, through the agency of Christian benevolence. Compared with the
                    inhabitants of towns, they may be said, except in particular districts, to be
                    almost entirely left to themselves. The consequence is, that the vices into
                    which they fall are more of a personal and individuital character; and that,
                    while they are exempt from some of the popular evils which prevail amongst
                    congregated masses of mankind, they are equally exempt from the benign influence
                    of combined effort, as it flows through the channels of Christian instruction,
                    and public beneficence.</p>
                <p>There is something in their circumstances, however, which, if they could be more
                    effectually reached by this influence, might tend very much to forward the views
                    of Christian benevolence on their behalf.<pb n="xv" xml:id="VAB7162-011"/> It is
                    the constant reference they are almost compelled to make to the superintendence
                    of Divine power.</p>
                <p>The mechanic has little inducement, from the circumstances by which he is
                    surrounded, to refer the success or the failure of his efforts, to anything
                    beyond mere physical causes. The rate of wages, the employment of other hands,
                    the patent inventions of the day, or the nature of the material in which he
                    works, are, with him and his fellow-labourers, the chief topics of calculation
                    and thought. But the farmer, even when he does limit his views to what is merely
                    physical, has a far wider field of observation, as regards the phenomena of
                    nature; and when he is sufficiently enlightened to look beyond this, he must be
                    insensible indeed not to be reminded every day, and every hour, by the changes
                    in the atmosphere, the aspect of the heavens, the chemical processes going
                    forward in the earth, the instinct of animals, and the economy of vegetation,
                    that a supreme and superintending power is above and around him—pervading and
                    governing the world—the secret spring of all movement—the source of all life—the
                    giver of all good.</p>
                <pb n="xvi" xml:id="VAB7162-012"/>
                <p>It would be idle to assert that all who are employed in cultivating the soil are
                    addicted to trains of thought in unison with such subjects. But the occupations
                    of the agricultural classes, and the scenes and circumstances with which they
                    are necessarily associated, are unquestionably conducive to an elevated tone of
                    mental exercise, and moral feeling; and there is much in their simple lives, and
                    in their recent and present experience, calculated to excite the deepest
                    interest in the minds of their countrymen.</p>

                    <l>And noontide shadows stealing o'er the plain</l>
                    <l>Warned them that nightfall soon must come again,</l>

                    <l>It was the harvest-home, and evening came</l>

                    <l>To tell the golden glories of that sky,</l>
                    <l>Where every tint of beauty seemed to lie</l>
                    <l>Sleeping in splendour, bathed in floods of light,</l>

                    <l>The harvest moon, above the distant hill,</l>

                    <l>Whose task of household toil had all been done</l>

                    <l>Demanding freedom for this happy day,</l>
                    <l>Sported, and laughed their merry thoughts away.</l>
                    <l>She heard the shouts, and listening, heard again,</l>

                    <l>O'er the wide board with rural plenty crowned,</l>
                    <l>Then turned from out her lowly door, to see</l>

                    <l>With eager hand she seized the sparkling draught,</l>
                    <l>And deep and long the cool clear liquid quaffed.</l>

                    <l>So well his sturdy frame was schooled and nerved,</l>

                    <l>There have been nights like this. Let memory tell</l>

                    <l>With more of natural impulse, and she spoke</l>
                    <l>In feeble accents, words that almost broke</l>

                    <l>That oft as keenly feels, when more resigned.</l>
                    <l>His outward bearing looked like patience too,</l>
                    <l>His brow was calm, his lamentations few,</l>
                    <l>But the deep grief within his soul that raged,</l>
                    <l>A fearful strife with every virtue waged.</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>There is a season of the waning year,</l>
                    <l>When, if the heavens are blue, and bright, and clear,</l>
                    <l>If cloudless sunshine sleeps along the plain,</l>
                    <l>We half believe that summer smiles again,</l>
                    <l>And deem the lingering flowers more bright and fair,</l>
                    <l>Fanned by the freshness of autumnal air.</l>
                    <l>But if the rains descend—the winds arise—</l>
                    <l>If clouds or tempest overcast the skies,</l>
                    <l>Or if a dull cold mist hangs on the day,</l>
                    <l>Too light to fall, too dense to float away,</l>
                    <l>Then winter reigns at once, with gloomy power,</l>
                    <l>And mournful looks each little opening flower,</l>

                    <l>As if misplaced, upon the sterile bed,</l>
                    <l>By faded leaves, and withering herbs o'erspread.</l>

                    <l>'Twas on such wintry morn of autumn day,</l>
                    <l>That William Herbert rose, but not to pray,</l>
                    <l>Not to look out upon his garden green,</l>
                    <l>That once his chosen paradise had been,</l>
                    <l>Not to look up to heaven with thankful heart,</l>
                    <l>He could not yet feel gratitude, apart</l>
                    <l>From her who taught him what was earthly bliss,</l>
                    <l>Who ne'er again would blend her smiles with his.</l>
                    <l>He rose the earliest, for he could not sleep,</l>
                    <l>And walked into his fields, and tried to weep;</l>
                    <l>But though he put away his manly pride,</l>
                    <l>Tears were a luxury to him denied.</l>
                    <l>So he returned, with restless wandering feet—</l>
                    <l>Where was the welcome his return to greet?</l>
                    <l>His home was silent, his domestics sad,</l>
                    <l>His children, in their first deep mourning clad,</l>

                    <l>Looked half abashed, the younger ones half pleased;</l>
                    <l>Their girlish airs his goaded spirit teased,</l>
                    <l>To think the sable trappings of the tomb</l>
                    <l>Should yield them other thoughts than grief and gloom.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>It was that day—the heaviest day of all,</l>
                    <l>When pent-up tears again begin to fall;</l>
                    <l>When that lone thing, its chamber shared by none,</l>
                    <l>The very dearest now begin to shun;</l>
                    <l>When distant friends arrive, and neighbours come</l>
                    <l>In solemn vestments to the mourner's home;</l>
                    <l>When business ceases, and all things give way,</l>
                    <l>To mark with more distinctness that one day.</l>

                    <l>It is not parting when the loved one dies,</l>

                    <l>And while the heart-wrung mourner stands and weeps,</l>
                    <l>Fond fancy whispers that the loved one sleeps.</l>
                    <pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7162-054"/>
                    <l>For there we see the same unclouded brow</l>
                    <l>That looked in hours of quiet, calm as now,</l>
                    <l>The meekly folded hands, the braided hair,</l>
                    <l>All—all the same, except more cold and fair.</l>
                    <l>But the true parting comes, with hearse and plume,</l>
                    <l>And strange rude sounds in that late silent room,</l>
                    <l>Breaking the sanctity we loved to keep,</l>
                    <l>Wakening, we almost fear, the dead from sleep,</l>
                    <l>Touching with hired hands—oh! name it not!</l>
                    <l>How can they violate that sacred spot!</l>
                    <l>Yet this true parting must be—the deep grave</l>
                    <l>Must have its own—no human power can save;</l>
                    <l>And we must look our very last, and know</l>
                    <l>The real depth—the bitterness of woe.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>With wintry aspect had that day begun,</l>
                    <l>There was no wind—no rain—but yet no sun;</l>
                    <l>A dreamy silence slumbered all around,</l>
                    <l>And damp and chill the dews lay on the ground,</l>
                    <pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7162-055"/>
                    <l>No movement stirred the air, save, now and then,</l>
                    <l>A leaf came flickering down upon the plain,</l>
                    <l>Or lonely robin from the leafless spray,</l>
                    <l>Tuned a sad song, then winged his flight away.</l>
                    <l>Such was the day, when forth the mourners came,</l>
                    <l>Some real mourners, others but in name,</l>
                    <l>Swelling the train with aspect sad and slow,</l>
                    <l>While half they mimicked, half partook the woe.</l>
                    <l>And now they reach the little churchyard green,</l>
                    <l>Where solemn priest in sacred stole is seen,</l>
                    <l>And place their burden down, and weep again,</l>
                    <l>All unabashed, before the eyes of men.</l>
                    <l>But he wept not, who mourned the most of all,</l>
                    <l>His shrouded eye no natural tears let fall.</l>
                    <l>Lonely, and wrapt in his deep anguish, there</l>
                    <l>He stood apart; he had no grief to share</l>
                    <l>With friend or neighbour. It was all his own.</l>
                    <l>He was a miser in this wealth alone.</l>
                    <l>He stood apart, no marble form more still;</l>
                    <l>Nor watchful eye could mark the withering thrill</l>
                    <pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7162-056"/>
                    <l>That ran through all his frame, at that deep sound</l>
                    <l>Of “dust to dust” within the hollow ground.</l>
                    <l>And when the silent mourners turned away,</l>
                    <l>He also turned. Why should he longer stay?</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>'Twas well for him, or for his outward mien,</l>
                    <l>His sister had arrived to grace the scene,</l>
                    <l>To deck his children in their costly black,</l>
                    <l>And now to lead him from the churchyard back,</l>
                    <l>To bid his neighbours to the plenteous board,</l>
                    <l>And smile as if all comfort was restored.</l>

                    <l>And William Herbert sate among the rest,</l>
                    <l>His silent thoughts deep locked within his breast.</l>
                    <l>He knew no single heart in all that throng</l>
                    <l>Could understand his grief. Then why prolong</l>
                    <l>The fruitless sympathy that touched him not,</l>
                    <l>But fell like rain upon some desert spot.</l>

                    <l>He sate among them, not a silent host,</l>
                    <l>Though few the words his quivering lip that crossed.</l>
                    <l>He bore their presence with a patient brow,</l>
                    <l>And seemed to hear, and understand, and know</l>
                    <l>All their small converse, and the smaller balm</l>
                    <l>They kindly offered him, to soothe and calm.</l>
                    <l>At last the day declines, and evening comes,</l>
                    <l>And they depart to seek their different homes,</l>
                    <l>While he retires to that familiar room</l>
                    <l>Where darkly falls the night, in tenfold gloom.</l>
                    <l>Again the couch is spread, the curtains drawn,</l>
                    <l>The unpressed pillow with its snow-white lawn,</l>
                    <l>Cold—cold as winter, and the silence there—</l>
                    <l>No voice to answer, and no ear to hear.</l>
                    <l>Lowly he falls upon his bended knee,</l>
                    <l>“It is too much!—kind Heaven, I come to thee.</l>
                    <l>Bear with me, gracious Father, yet awhile,</l>
                    <l>For I have been too happy in thy smile,</l>
                    <l>Unschooled in all the chastenings of thy rod,</l>

                    <l>Thus William Herbert met the world again,</l>
                    <l>And mixed in all the wonted ways of men,</l>
                    <l>Unchanged in things that common friends would mark;</l>
                    <l>Yet altered was that world to him, and dark.</l>
                    <l>One bitter drop mixed with his daily cup,</l>
                    <l>One spring of life—the sweetest—all dried up.</l>
                    <l>As yields the leading branch of goodly tree</l>
                    <l>Unto the cankerworm, so yielded he;</l>
                    <l>All its fresh boughs but that, still green and gay,</l>
                    <l>That one consumed by premature decay.</l>
                    <l>Thus he went forth again, and bought, and sold,</l>
                    <l>And gained new influence, and amassed more gold;</l>
                    <l>For all things prospered with him, and he grew</l>
                    <l>A man of weight amongst the simple few,</l>

                    <l>And round his hearth a fairy band was seen</l>

                    <l>Or on the flowery bank, or in the dell,</l>
                    <l>Where rippling streams were wont to sink and swell.</l>
                    <l>A lovely band they were, and full of glee,</l>
                    <l>Rich in the bloom of untamed infancy.</l>
                    <l>Sweet liberty 'twas yet their bliss to boast,</l>
                    <l>No native tone, no inborn gladness lost</l>
                    <l>Thought was just leading through their infant minds</l>
                    <l>That endless clue that human knowledge winds,</l>
                    <l>While vague conclusions, such as nature draws,</l>
                    <l>Awoke some glimmerings of effect and cause.</l>

                    <l>Had far outstripped stern wisdom, even here.</l>

                    <l>And wreathing curls around their brows of snow,</l>
                    <l>And rosy smiles that quickly come and go,</l>
                    <l>With some faint touch of mournfulness the while,</l>
                    <l>As if those fair lips might not always smile;</l>
                    <l>And the deep shadow of their soft dark eyes</l>
                    <l>More of tenderness than men deem wise.</l>

                    <l>Brought by his aunt from the next market town;</l>
                    <l>And every week a fresh supply came down.</l>
                    <l>These had he found, and greedily devoured,</l>
                    <l>While the sweet poison o'er his bosom poured.</l>
                    <l>Here had he learned what time could ne'er unteach,</l>
                    <l>By all that sage might say, or pastor preach;</l>
                    <l>And, absent, moody, dreamer as he was,</l>
                    <l>His aunt looked on, nor knew to check the cause.</l>

                    <l>Matilda Herbert was more fair than wise,</l>
                    <l>She had not dim, but undiscerning eyes.</l>
                    <l>Books were to her amusement, nothing more,</l>
                    <l>To kill the weary time she read them o'er.</l>
                    <l>So that a maiden loved, a hero bled,</l>
                    <l>Enough for her, the volume soon was read.</l>
                    <l>She had been trained in city schools, and thought</l>
                    <l>Good manners should at any price be bought,</l>
                    <l>Good clothing and good looks beyond even these,</l>
                    <l>Nor failed good furniture her eye to please.</l>
                    <l>Thus she looked down upon the farmer's home,</l>
                    <l>And deemed it much to quit the town, and come</l>
                    <l>To scenes so humble, rustic, and obscure,</l>
                    <l>Which, but for novels, she could ne'er endure.</l>
                    <l>Still she was kind, and had the heart to love</l>
                    <l>Sweet children, if they would but learn to move</l>
                    <l>Softly and gracefully, and curtsy low,</l>
                    <l>And go about as well-bred children go.</l>
                    <l>'Twas in such teaching, here she found a band</l>
                    <l>Of idle rebels under her fair hand.</l>

                    <l>Nature was yet too strong within their hearts,</l>
                    <l>For all to learn at once their different parts,</l>
                    <l>And scorn crept in sometimes, and marred the rule</l>
                    <l>She sought to establish in her polished school;</l>
                    <l>And they rushed forth, when hours of play came round,</l>
                    <l>Like pent-up torrents, with such bursts of sound</l>
                    <l>From silvery voices, and such laughter wild,</l>
                    <l>As left small hope to make them soft or mild.</l>

                    <l>Rosy, and dimpled o'er with smiles of glee,</l>
                    <l>The worst of all that rebel band was she.</l>
                    <l>For if one moment she looked grave or shy,</l>
                    <l>Some frolic fun flashed from her hazel eye,</l>
                    <l>Or mimic majesty set forth the grace</l>
                    <l>With which her aunt embellished all her ways.</l>
                    <l>Yet was she grave sometimes—by Henry's side,</l>
                    <l>And to be near him was her joy and pride;</l>

                    <l>To share his sport was bliss enough for her,</l>
                    <l>Yet much she strove his sorrows too to share;</l>
                    <l>And oft would check her mirth, to think, and pause,</l>
                    <l>But ne'er could fully comprehend their cause.</l>
                    <l>The world to her was all so fair and bright,</l>
                    <l>Its petty cares so transient and so light;</l>
                    <l>No thought had she for maladies of mind,</l>
                    <l>While those she loved were happy, good, and kind.</l>
                    <l>Thus when her brother's moody fit came on,</l>
                    <l>And she beheld him wandering all alone,</l>
                    <l>She ran to join him, that he might not be</l>
                    <l>So lonely, and so wrapt in mystery.</l>
                    <l>Then would she tell him sportive tales, and gay,</l>
                    <l>And try to win him to his favourite play,</l>
                    <l>Till he became a wiser, happier boy,</l>
                    <l>And smiled again with gratitude and joy.</l>

                    <l>Love was her element, nor could she live</l>
                    <l>Without this richest of all boons to give.</l>
                    <l>She would have loved her aunt, and often tried,</l>
                    <l>When evening came, to nestle to her side;</l>
                    <l>Till quick repulse forbade the child to press</l>
                    <l>So closely as to spoil her silken dress.</l>
                    <l>Then would she sit apart, and wait, and watch</l>

                    <l>And bloody field, with glory in its sound,</l>
                    <l>And gentle eyes awhile forgot to weep,</l>
                    <l>So strong the patriot call—so loud and deep.</l>
                    <l>And Britain answered from her northern dales,</l>
                    <l>Her peaceful hamlets, and her southern vales;</l>
                    <l>Her yeoman bands forsook their flocks, and rose</l>
                    <l>With sword in hand, to guard their country's cause.</l>
                    <l>The w aving plume, the glittering helm and spear,</l>
                    <l>With bold defiance of all doubt and fear,</l>
                    <l>Dazzling the wary, deafening the distressed,</l>
                    <l>Stunning the voice of pity in the breast;</l>
                    <l>Till war became a sort of demon-god,</l>
                    <l>And men could bleed and worship under his fierce rod.</l>

                    <l>Keen avarice, too, with tearless eye, looked on.</l>
                    <l>And men who would have mourned a single death,</l>

                    <l>And thus their greedy gains they counted o'er,</l>
                    <l>Blessing themselves for prosperous men in trade,</l>

                    <l>Was William Herbert such a man as these?</l>
                    <l>Why question we? Our simple tale agrees</l>
                    <l>With other tales of human nature told,</l>
                    <l>How grows the insidious love and thirst of gold.</l>
                    <l>Yet let us vindicate his name again,</l>
                    <l>From taint of avarice, that foulest stain.</l>
                    <l>He was no miser, but he knew that wealth</l>
                    <l>Though it could neither purchase life, nor health,</l>
                    <l>Nor peace of mind—could purchase good esteem</l>
                    <l>Before the world, could make the humble seem</l>
                    <l>Exalted, and the silent sufferer blest,</l>
                    <l>Softening the pillow of the sore distressed.</l>
                    <l>Thus, though he truly grieved such tales to hear</l>
                    <l>Of wide destruction from the fields of war,</l>
                    <l>Yet fired with that old-fashioned patriot zeal,</l>
                    <l>That but for one dear spot of earth can feel,</l>
                    <l>Deeming each Frenchman too a deadly foe,</l>
                    <l>Created, formed, and fated to be so,</l>
                    <l>That death most glorious for one's country's good,</l>

                    <l>Were bright with verdure, and the gales that come</l>
                    <l>Laden with summer perfume, softly blew</l>
                    <l>And woke the early flowers 'mid summer dew.</l>

                    <l>Green was the grassy plot before that door,</l>
                    <l>The sloping border richly spangled o'er;</l>
                    <l>For nice the eye that watched that garden now,</l>
                    <l>And choice the flowers her care had brought to blow.</l>
                    <l>While all within the rural dwelling too</l>
                    <l>Assumed a look less rustic, and more new.</l>
                    <l>For there were carpets wrought by foreign looms,</l>
                    <l>And costly curtains to the ancient rooms,</l>
                    <l>Save to one window, narrow-paned, and low,</l>
                    <l>Whose verdant screen was still allowed to grow.</l>
                    <l>There rose the cherry-tree with blossoms white,</l>
                    <l>Spreading its page of promise to the sight,</l>
                    <l>While on each side there grew a rosy bower.</l>
                    <l>With sweetbriar wakening to the balmy shower,</l>
                    <l>And darker jessamine its stars displayed,</l>
                    <l>Gleaming and twinkling through the leafy shade,</l>
                    <l>Like fairy moonlight; and above them all,</l>
                    <l>The ambitious ivy climbed along the wall.</l>
                    <l>Within that lattice low, a clustering vine</l>
                    <l>Was trained, and taught its tendrils green to twine</l>

                    <l>Into a leafy canopy, and throw</l>
                    <l>Its soft cool shadow on the room below,</l>
                    <l>Tempering the noontide radiance of the sun,</l>
                    <l>When o'er that rustic roof his light was thrown.</l>
                    <l>It was a wide bow-window, never now</l>
                    <l>Hath modern taste a scene like that to show;</l>
                    <l>But such a scene for moonlight! There would come</l>
                    <l>Pale glancing beams into that ancient room,</l>
                    <l>With deepest shade from venerable trees</l>
                    <l>That slowly waved their branches in the breeze,</l>
                    <l>While over the green turf and silvery dew</l>
                    <l>Each stately stem a line of darkness threw.</l>
                    <l>And then the stillness! Not a sound was there,</l>
                    <l>But the low whisper of the evening air,</l>
                    <l>And shivering poplar, with its trembling leaves,</l>
                    <l>That oft a tale of midnight mystery weaves.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Who could have lingered long mid such a scene</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Nor was it in this lovely room alone</l>
                    <l>That comfort reigned, or taste; for there was thrown</l>
                    <l>An air of beauty over every one:</l>
                    <l>Something that bade you welcome—woo'd your stay,</l>
                    <l>And seemed your lingering footsteps to delay;</l>
                    <l>Something that new-built rooms can never bring</l>
                    <l>With all their pomp of modern furnishing</l>
                    <l>To bear upon the feelings, or to pay</l>

                    <l>Upon these pleasant rooms, they were so low.</l>
                    <l>It was no use to paper or to paint,</l>
                    <l>The walls were old, the mantel-pieces quaint,</l>
                    <l>The entrance mean; she never saw a door</l>
                    <l>That looked so like the master's being poor.</l>
                    <pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7162-082"/>
                    <l>Entrance was every thing. There was no space</l>
                    <l>To meet a guest with courtesy or grace,</l>
                    <l>No drawing-room! She really never knew</l>
                    <l>A house where comforts were so small and few.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>“Comforts!” the farmer thought, “with all this stir</l>
                    <l>I see them not so plenteous as they were.</l>
                    <l>Yet be it so. These trifles touch not me,</l>
                    <l>So that the children and their aunt agree.”</l>
                    <l>For they would sometimes break from her control,</l>
                    <l>And tell him tales that vexed his very soul,</l>
                    <l>Of idle strife, in which they scarce were brought</l>
                    <l>At last to yield, and rarely deemed they ought.</l>
                    <l>Yet was each cause of contest so minute,</l>
                    <l>No sapient judge might settle the dispute.</l>
                    <l>Thus would they teaze the parent's spirit more,</l>
                    <l>Until, in hope some quiet to restore,</l>
                    <l>He sent his daughters to a distant school,</l>
                    <l>To learn submission to a wiser rule.</l>
                </lg>
                <pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7162-083"/>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>But ere they went, a most important cause</l>
                    <l>For consultation, made the parties pause.</l>
                    <l>Where should they send them to? The aunt believed</l>
                    <l>Her brother oft in his sage views deceived.</l>
                    <l>Thus would she guide his judgment by her own,</l>
                    <l>That bright results her happier hopes might crown.</l>
                    <l>Good schools were all her theme. The farmer, too,</l>
                    <l>Sought a good school to send his daughters to.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>But never yet was word less understood,</l>
                    <l>Than that plain word of simple meaning—good.</l>
                    <l>Good is to many what they most desire,</l>
                    <l>To others, only what will raise them higher.</l>
                    <l>And thus the aunt believed those schools were good,</l>
                    <l>Where vulgar persons never might intrude,</l>
                    <l>Where terms were high, and ladies all were taught</l>
                    <l>To sit, and stand, and curtsy as they ought,</l>
                    <l>To sing with skill, to touch the harp with grace,</l>
                    <l>To paint a landscape, or a human face,</l>
                    <pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7162-084"/>
                    <l>To speak Italian, French, and sometimes Greek,</l>
                    <l>To write in angles sharp, and lines oblique.</l>
                    <l>These were the schools Matilda Herbert meant</l>
                    <l>By good, and here the wondering girls were sent.</l>
                    <l>For she was one who brought her ends about,</l>
                    <l>By talking long, and wearing patience out;</l>
                    <l>And little knew her brother of the skill</l>
                    <l>To win or wind a woman to his will.</l>
                    <l>Thus inly wishing that her words would cease,</l>
                    <l>He oft resigned, for very love of peace.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>And now, the girlish band of idlers gone,</l>
                    <l>The farmer turned for pleasure to his son.</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Vain thought! But still it lingered in his brain,</l>

                    <l>And there were many voices, quick, and clear,</l>
                    <l>That in their various tones assailed his ear</l>
                    <l>All on one side—“That ancient house must fall!”</l>

                    <l>And pitying much the occupants within,</l>
                    <l>He gave his word—the builders should begin.</l>

                    <l>All that would make the house substantial, large,</l>
                    <l>Good, and respectable, should be his charge;</l>
                    <l>But if the farmer's thoughts were raised more high,</l>
                    <l>His own resources must the rest supply.</l>

                    <l>Then came the architect, with curious look</l>

                    <l>Yes, every pane of that low window made</l>
                    <l>Part of his calculation—'twas his trade.</l>
                    <l>And followed soon the unrelenting band</l>
                    <l>Of sturdy workmen, each with able hand,</l>

                    <l>He saw them all prepared, and then withdrew,</l>
                    <l>Wending through fields of tufted corn and hay,</l>

                    <l>Was that which now the farmer called his home;</l>
                    <l>And all sat down with well-contented air</l>
                    <l>To watch improvement still progressing there.</l>
                    <l>The aunt looked on, and, smiling, gave command,</l>

                    <l>Consulting others, acted for herself.</l>
                    <l>Lucy was wrapt in thought. Above, below,</l>
                    <l>Visions of future comfort seemed to grow,</l>
                    <l>But while she mused, a sigh would sometimes tell</l>
                    <l>The past to her, was yet remembered well.</l>
                    <l>Helen cared little for the humble past,</l>
                    <l>Her soul's proud anchor in the future cast.</l>
                    <l>That unknown future seemed a world of wealth,</l>
                    <l>From whence she drew for her young spirit's health;</l>
                    <l>For satisfying draught had never yet</l>
                    <l>Passed her warm lips. Her morning sun might set.</l>
                    <l>Were there not brighter worlds to win elsewhere,</l>
                    <l>Beyond the circle of her native sphere?</l>

                    <l>Genius, that wildfire of the brain, was hers;</l>
                    <l>Taste, that too oft the impossible prefers;</l>
                    <l>Ambition, searching for some untried good;</l>
                    <l>With vague emotions, still less understood;</l>
                    <l>Pleasures, and pains, a vacillating host,</l>
                    <l>That never yet the vulgar pathway crossed;</l>
                    <l>All these, implanted in her ardent mind,</l>
                    <l>If not more happy, made her more refined;</l>
                    <l>Gave to her spirit, even in early youth,</l>
                    <l>Its quenchless thirst for beauty, more than truth.</l>
                    <l>And with this impulse came—how oft it comes,</l>
                    <l>Disdain for humble means, and lowly homes,</l>
                    <l>And all the intercourse of rural life,</l>
                    <l>With homely matron, or domestic wife.</l>
                    <l>These Helen shunned, scarce wishing to offend,</l>
                    <l>Yet wishing less to call such neighbour friend.</l>
                    <l>Her friends were in the books of taste she loved,</l>
                    <l>The woods, the hills, the valleys where she roved,</l>
                    <l>The landscapes she designed, the scenes she drew</l>

                    <l>Reflecting in its light her Hebe form,</l>
                    <l>With Grecian forehead, but with blushes warm—</l>
                    <l>Too warm, too true, to woman's early prime,</l>
                    <l>For sculptured goddess of the olden time.</l>
                    <l>Nor less her passion for the sister art,</l>
                    <l>Whose power more quickly thrills the human heart.</l>
                    <l>Martha was musical, and had the skill</l>
                    <l>To sing and warble like a woodland rill;</l>
                    <l>But Helen loved the science, and her ear</l>
                    <l>Was pained by sounds to untaught minstrels dear.</l>
                    <l>Thus many a joy her happier sister knew,</l>
                    <l>Was unrevealed to her exalted view;</l>
                    <l>And while on Mlartha's brow contentment sat,</l>
                    <l>Helen aspired to share some loftier fate.</l>
                    <l>With deeper fondness for poetic lore,</l>
                    <l>Henry was formed to live with nature more;</l>
                    <l>With his own favourite Burns, by wood and stream,</l>
                    <l>Of summer birds and autumn gales to dream.</l>

                    <l>While Lucy, her own feelings unexpressed,</l>
                    <l>Seemed but to smile or suffer for the rest.</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Yet did the happy band united rove,</l>

                    <l>Along the flowery paths of early life,</l>
                    <l>Free from its cankering care, and sordid strife.</l>
                    <l>If melancholy sometimes touched their brows,</l>

                    <l>The farmer's mansion now was all complete,</l>

                    <l>Yet even to him, insensibly, had grown</l>

                    <l>For one still brought another in its train,</l>
                    <l>If this was elegant, must that be plain?</l>
                    <l>Good taste forbade—“If modern couches here,</l>

                    <l>Thus grew the scene, as all such scenes will grow;</l>
                    <l>Though few philosophers can tell us how:</l>

                    <l>What boots the wealth by ceaseless toil attained,</l>
                    <l>The pomp, the splendour, by ambition gained,</l>
                    <l>If lost, or hidden from admiring gaze,</l>
                    <l>Through scenes retired our silent steps we trace:</l>
                    <l>If rural shades conceal it from the world,</l>

                    <l>How sped those moments to the fluttering throng,</l>
                    <l>Bright garden vistas, and green bowers among?</l>
                    <l>The proudest day that dawned on Helen—this</l>
                    <l>The hour most redolent of fancied bliss.</l>
                    <l>Lord William Douglas was an honoured name,</l>
                    <l>Known to the world, and could he be the same?</l>
                    <l>He was; and Helen heard him talk, and tell</l>
                    <l>Of battles fought, and wounds remembered well.</l>
                    <l>Battles? and he so young!—wounds? and so fair!</l>
                    <l>With princely hand, and waves of golden hair!</l>
                    <l>Tall and majestic was his martial mien,</l>
                    <l>In visions Helen such a form had seen.</l>

                    <l>What could induce him thus to condescend—</l>
                    <l>With his vast store of knowledge to unbend?</l>
                    <l>Say, was he all the courtly man he seemed?</l>
                    <l>No, of his distant native vale he dreamed;</l>
                    <l>And rural sights, and pastoral scenes, had power</l>
                    <l>To win his spirit back to childhood's hour.</l>
                    <l>Then would the pride of rank, the pomp of arms,</l>
                    <l>Lose in his eye their artificial charms;</l>
                    <l>Then would he cast the hero from his brow,</l>
                    <l>While o'er his lip truth's simple tide would flow..</l>
                    <l>And Helen listened, like a wood-nymph wild</l>
                    <l>Caught by some strain of music, soft, and mild.</l>
                    <l>Her eye intent, her rosy lips apart,</l>
                    <l>Her cheek suffused with blushes from her heart.</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Soon passed that hour. The lordly train were gone,</l>
                    <l>The farmer's family were left alone;</l>
                    <l>And even those who wished them gone before</l>

                    <l>Long did the aunt expatiate on their dress,</l>
                    <l>And sage opinion of its cost express;</l>
                    <l>While Martha, half admiring, half in doubt,</l>
                    <l>Hinted how strangely they had peeped about;</l>
                    <l>As if they felt they had the right to come</l>
                    <l>And see the furnishing of every room.</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Then rose the warm defence on Helen's part,</l>
                    <l>With those keen jests that troubled Martha's heart;</l>
                    <l>For she was listening to the manly suit</l>

                    <l>Than worthy tradesman of the neighbouring town,</l>
                    <l>And many a sneer upon his love was thrown.</l>
                    <l>Not by the farmer, for he knew him well,</l>
                    <l>And oft his worth and generous deeds would tell:</l>
                    <l>How he had fostered with parental care</l>
                    <l>His orphan sister, sickly, young, and fair;</l>
                    <l>How he had laboured to retrieve his name</l>

                    <l>And how, before his fellow-men he stood,</l>
                    <l>With character unblemished, staunch, and good.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Such was the man who sued for Martha's hand,</l>

                    <l>He had her father's praise, and that was much,</l>
                    <l>But yet to woman's heart how keen the touch</l>
                    <l>Of sisters' satire, and of brother's scorn.</l>
                    <l>This she might brook—that never could be borne.</l>
                    <l>For they would talk, with many a droll grimace,</l>
                    <l>Of tapes, and trimmings, calicoes, and lace,</l>
                    <l>Of pence and halfpence, counted out with care,</l>
                    <l>And oftener still, of Gilpin's trip to Ware;</l>
                    <l>Till Martha caught the same infectious smile,</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>At last she roused herself. This would not do—</l>

                    <l>This would not do She went at evening hour,</l>
                    <l>And found her brother in their favourite bower;</l>
                    <l>She saw him musing, lost in gloomy thought,</l>
                    <l>And wished some joyful tidings she had brought.</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>“Henry,” she said, and kissed his mournful brow,</l>

                    <l>Had spared her youth with discipline to train,</l>
                    <l>And thus consigned her to a world of pain.</l>
                    <l>True, she appeared most gentle, kind, and fair,</l>
                    <l>As untried characters so often are;</l>
                    <l>But a spoiled child to feeble woman grown,</l>

                    <l>It was the time for waving woods to show</l>

                    <l>For golden grain to wave alone the field,</l>

                    <l>Here Henry found them, not like nymphs of old</l>

                    <l>Declared she never could the streamlet pass,</l>

                    <l>While trembling, laughing, she would step within</l>
                    <l>The brook's clear margin, with her slipper thin,</l>
                    <l>Then say she needs must die, for never yet</l>

                    <l>No labour lost to satisfy or please,</l>
                    <l>No fear the keenest hunger to appease.</l>
                    <l>Vast had the preparation been, and vast</l>
                    <l>The admiring wonder of each rural guest.</l>
                    <l>Dishes were there of which they ne'er had heard,</l>
                    <l>While those best known, so strangely were prepared,</l>

                    <l>Thus ignorant what to ask for, or to trust,</l>

                    <l>And thus she feared not that fair path to tread.</l>

                    <l>Nothing was wanting now: she once had been</l>
                    <l>Lonely and sad, when gazing on that scene—</l>
                    <l>The village church—the trees—and that low grave,</l>
                    <l>O'er which the elms their dark green branches wave.</l>
                    <l>Here had she wandered, and had ofttimes thought</l>

                    <l>No future bliss could ever soothe her pain,</l>

                    <l>Here had she mused, and wept those tears unseen,</l>
                    <l>Which but for secret channels ne'er had been;</l>
                    <l>Tears that will sometimes dim the sunny eye,</l>

                    <l>The maid was startled into helplessness.</l>

                    <l>To share the comforts of his father's home;</l>
                    <l>For there was room enough for him and her,</l>

                    <l>To deem herself the most ill-fated woman.</l>
                    <l>“Wait, Henry dear,” the prudent sister said,</l>

                    <l>To gaze admiring on this glorious world—</l>
                    <l>The flag of smiling plenty wide unfurled,</l>
                    <pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7162-220"/>
                    <l>Floating afar from every verdant height,</l>
                    <l>In every valley waving to the sight.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>What floods of life then swell the tide of hope!</l>
                    <l>The white flocks grazing on the mountain slope,</l>
                    <l>The peaceful herds in the green pastures laid,</l>
                    <l>And sweet songs echoing through the leafy glade.</l>
                    <l>For all this fulness—this extreme of good,</l>
                    <l>What can we render but our gratitude?</l>
                    <l>That how withhold? or, while we feel and live,</l>
                    <l>Our heart's best incense how refuse to give?</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>So felt the farmer ofttimes, when he gazed</l>
                    <l>On nature's face, and then he inly praised</l>
                    <l>That gracious hand, which freely spread the whole</l>
                    <l>Like a perpetual banquet for his soul.</l>
                    <l>'Twas thus he roamed, with Henry by his side,</l>
                    <l>From field to field, while yet the flowing tide</l>

                    <l>Of hope and joy had scarce attained its height,</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>But soon dark evenings came, and winds blew loud,</l>
                    <l>And the wide heavens were clothed as with a shroud:</l>
                    <l>No sunshine pierced the gloom, and yet no rain</l>
                    <l>Fell on the earth its ripening bloom to stain.</l>
                    <l>There seemed a darkness in the very air—</l>
                    <l>Something that bade the boding soul prepare—</l>
                    <l>At length it came. Fierce northern gales blew wild,</l>
                    <l>And tore the leafy boughs where beauty smiled;</l>
                    <l>The floods fell heavily, and bowed the grain</l>
                    <l>Beneath the tempest and the sheeted rain.</l>
                    <l>It ceased awhile. The reapers had begun</l>
                    <l>Their task of hope, though still the clouded sun</l>
                    <l>Kept far aloof, and hid his smiling brow;</l>
                    <l>Yet they resumed their joyless labour now</l>
                    <l>Uncheered, and doubtful how the end would prove,</l>
                    <l>So cold the earth, so dark the skies above.</l>
                    <pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7162-222"/>
                    <l>Nor waited long the tempest-laden gales.</l>
                    <l>Again they come—the hissing shower prevails:</l>
                    <l>Low pools arise, and widen into floods;</l>
                    <l>Like rushing waves resound the leafy woods;</l>
                    <l>While cornfields, beaten level as the plain,</l>
                    <l>Lie, lost and hopeless, blackening in the rain.</l>

                    <l>And William Herbert saw the ruin spread,</l>
                    <l>And oft arose at midnight from his bed,</l>
                    <l>To listen if the rushing rains had ceased,</l>
                    <l>Or if the wrath of heaven was yet appeased.</l>
                    <l>But midnight only seemed to darken o'er</l>
                    <l>All that was bleak and desolate before;</l>
                    <l>While louder rushed the foaming torrent then,</l>
                    <l>And heavier fell the rain-drops on the pane.</l>
                    <l>How dreary were those hours of midnight gloom</l>
                    <l>To the lone parent in his cheerless room!</l>
                    <l>And sorely did he need a hand to smooth</l>
                    <l>His restless couch—a gentle voice to soothe.</l>

                    <l>But she was gone, who would have stayed his soul</l>
                    <l>From sinking, by the silent sweet control</l>
                    <l>Of woman's influence, and of woman's love,</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Sad were the scenes which met the farmer's eye</l>

                    <l>Thick-matted heaps, o'er which the rank weeds threw</l>
                    <l>Their clustering arms, and down the burden drew;</l>
                    <l>While sprouting corn in coarse luxuriance lay</l>
                    <l>Prone on the ground—embedded in the clay.</l>
                    <l>These met his view; and furrows filled with rain</l>
                    <l>Soaking and saturating all his grain.</l>
                    <l>And then his labourers, dripping with the showers,</l>
                    <l>Wasting in idleness their noontide hours,</l>
                    <l>Beneath the hawthorn hedge, behind the sheaves,</l>
                    <l>Or where the sycamore extends her leaves;</l>
                    <l>Yet all expecting payment on the day</l>
                    <l>When their full wages he was wont to pay.</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>It was a sight to move the farmer's heart—</l>
                    <l>Almost to make the unmanly tear-drop start</l>
                    <l>In Henry's eye; for he had much at stake,</l>
                    <l>His home to lose—his fortune all to make.</l>
                    <l>And he was young, and life to him was fair,</l>
                    <l>How could he look around, and not despair?</l>
                    <l>How could he look around, and see the waste—</l>
                    <l>The desolation o'er his prospects cast,</l>

                    <l>How had he sinned, to merit such a doom?</l>
                    <l>Or, worse—why Heaven should blast the generous boon</l>

                    <l>By which this world is governed, and sustained.</l>
                    <l>Enough for us, that God's own end is gained;</l>
                    <l>That end beyond the range of human mind,</l>

                    <l>Was sad but silent, and no murmuring word,</l>
                    <l>Or sound impatient, from his lips was heard.</l>
                    <l>But Henry, restless as a fretful child,</l>
                    <l>With dark anticipations almost wild,</l>
                    <l>Reckoned his loss, and counted o'er his fears;</l>
                    <l>While his fair bride reproached him with her tears,</l>

                    <l>So passed that gloomy season, and there grew</l>

                    <l>Small, but yet frequent—who should most give up,</l>

                    <l>Some felt themselves arrayed for any court,</l>
                    <l>While others thought their utmost power fell short</l>
                    <l>Of what they wished, 'mid such a scene, to wear,</l>
                    <l>And still, to all, the appointed hour drew near.</l>

                    <l>How fared it then in William Herbert's home?</l>
                    <l>It seemed as if no summons there had come—</l>
                    <l>No preparation—no consulting there—</l>
                    <l>Could they not mean that festival to share?</l>
                    <l>Truth was, they were prepared for such a scene,</l>
                    <l>And only wished their family had been</l>
                    <l>Passed by—forgotten—anything but asked.</l>
                    <l>How should their hatred of the thing be masked?</l>
                    <l>To go, a vassal rather than a guest,</l>
                    <l>And sit with hungry boors at that great feast!—</l>
                    <l>It was too humbling to their secret pride;</l>
                    <l>And yet their landlord's bidding they must bide.</l>

                    <l>“And since it must be,” William Herbert said,</l>
                    <l>“Let us all hope some good may yet be made</l>
                    <l>Of this strange meeting. Such there used to be</l>
                    <l>Between the landlords and their tenantry</l>
                    <l>In days of yore; and we may go to hear</l>
                    <l>Of rents being lessened for the coming year.”</l>

                    <l>Matilda Herbert recollected then</l>

                    <l>Must needs be there; while Emma thought aside</l>
                    <l>Henry would like to show his lovely bride.</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>It had been difficult for Helen's mind</l>

                    <l>Against her pride hope's glimmering of faint joy,</l>
                    <l>Which still she strove by reasoning to destroy.</l>

                    <l>Amongst those grooms Lord William's servant seen,</l>
                    <l>So she resolved, more complaisance to show,</l>
                    <l>Her father's wishes to consult, and go.</l>

                    <l>Lucy was held excused: she had no heart</l>
                    <l>To grace a pageant, or to act a part;</l>
                    <l>And thus she lent her willing hand to all,</l>
                    <l>To braid the hair, and fold the graceful shawl.</l>
                    <l>Her aunt she decked, magnificently gay,</l>

                    <l>Emma, adorned in colours pure and chaste,</l>

                    <l>No tear had yet bedewed her feverish cheek,</l>
                    <l>No word of sorrow had she deigned to speak;</l>
                    <pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7162-242"/>
                    <l>But through the silent night, when none are near,</l>
                    <l>A wounded spirit is too hard to bear</l>
                    <l>Without some natural overflow of grief—</l>
                    <l>And tears were surely given to bring relief.</l>
                    <l>Lucy was sleeping, or appeared to sleep,</l>
                    <l>So Helen fearlessly began to weep.</l>
                    <l>With such excess the tide of sorrow grew,</l>
                    <l>She heard not the soft step that near her drew,</l>
                    <l>Nor saw the gentle form beside her bed,</l>
                    <l>That bent with deepest feeling o'er her head.</l>

                    <l>It was Lucy's voice,</l>
                    <l>Sweet as an angels, and she had no choice</l>
                    <l>But to disclose the secret of her woes,</l>
                    <l>While darkness hid her blushes as they rose.</l>
                    <l>For there was shame—deep-burning shame, with all</l>
                    <l>That else had pained; but this was mingling gall</l>

                    <l>She told how Douglas had appeared that night</l>
                    <l>Like some bright vision, dazzling to her sight;</l>
                    <l>How he no sign of memory betrayed,</l>
                    <l>How, with another pleased, he scorned the rustic maid.</l>

                    <l>Yet this was nothing. “Can I tell the rest?</l>
                    <l>Yes; and for ever tear him from my breast.</l>
                    <l>The titled guests had joined the merry dance,</l>
                    <l>Ladies, and lords, and waiting-maids from France;</l>
                    <l>All blending in one many-coloured maze,</l>
                    <l>While those who could not dance stood round to gaze.</l>
                    <l>At length the ladies of the hall retired,</l>
                    <l>When louder grew the glee, and more inspired</l>
                    <l>Each booted jockey, and each turbaned dame,</l>
                    <l>That forth from out their hiding-places came.</l>

                    <l>I would have left, but heard my father say</l>
                    <l>We must not be the first to turn away.</l>
                    <l>Thus came my punishment. Oh, Lucy, hide</l>
                    <l>Thy searching eyes, and spare thy sister's pride!</l>
                    <l>Douglas returned, and now he came alone,</l>
                    <l>All the proud revellers but him were gone.</l>
                    <l>He came with smiles upon his altered brow,</l>
                    <l>And the poor farmer's daughter he could know;</l>
                    <l>Could touch her hand familiarly, and say</l>
                    <l>How well she looked, how happy was that day.</l>
                    <l>I fear there was a blush upon my cheek</l>
                    <l>As he drew near; and when I tried to speak,</l>
                    <l>I could not quite my trembling voice control;</l>
                    <l>For something came like gladness to my soul,</l>
                    <l>After long grief. But, oh! it passed away,</l>
                    <l>And left such blackness! Lucy, never say</l>
                    <l>One word of this to any human ear.</l>
                    <l>Keep it, dear Lucy, and be more than dear.</l>
                    <l>I thought his words were somewhat strange, and free,</l>
                    <l>And when I looked into his face to see</l>

                    <l>His real meaning, there I read the whole!</l>
                    <l>His brow was flushed—his eye-balls seemed to roll—</l>
                    <l>Wine was the secret of his gallantry,</l>
                    <l>And I, amid those dancing grooms, might be</l>

                    <l>Their landlord, kind and complaisant of mood,</l>
                    <l>Smiled on them all, and hoped they understood</l>
                    <l>What the great pressure of the times required;</l>
                    <l>How able men, in what they most desired</l>
                    <l>As best and wisest for the state, should be</l>
                    <l>Supported by their faithful tenantry.</l>
                    <l>In short, amid the wreck of that sad year,</l>
                    <l>He plainly told them, that they must appear</l>
                    <l>On the next rent-day with an added sum;</l>
                    <l>That he was going abroad; but one would come</l>
                    <l>Well authorized, and able to enforce,</l>
                    <l>In all he wished, to adopt the surest course.</l>
                    <l>“You have your choice,” he said, “to go, or stay;</l>
                    <l>But I must have my money, come what may.”</l>

                    <l>How did they bear those tidings? Some went home</l>
                    <l>Early, and sullenly. Like children, some</l>
                    <l>Pleaded, and strove to modify their doom;</l>
                    <l>While others, reckless—maddened with despair,</l>

                    <l>And one went home to spend that evening cold</l>

                    <l>They closed the gate, whose echo brought to mind</l>

                    <l>They turned, and saw the glimmering of his fire,</l>

                    <l>Where want complained, or hopeless suffering wept.</l>
                    <l>Her sister Martha, generous still, and true</l>

                    <l>Her heart's warm interest from the lowly few</l>
                    <l>Who used to claim her sympathy and care;</l>

                    <l>And her mild speech, and earnest looks, could win</l>
                    <l>Entire belief, when argument had been</l>
                    <l>Fruitless and vain, as breath of idle wind,</l>
                    <l>To check the impulse of a wounded mind.</l>
                    <l>Thus had she felt more earnestly the need</l>

                    <l>Of discontent amongst the village poor,</l>
                    <l>Driven, as they called it, from the farmer's door.</l>

                    <l>That bares too soon its bosom to the blast,</l>
                    <l>She went, regardless of herself, and strove</l>
                    <l>To waken for her father, thoughts of love;</l>
                    <l>To prove him blameless, and to still the sigh,</l>

                    <l>Nor vague desire might ever there intrude,</l>

                    <l>Bearing her up, life's troubled waves above.</l>
                    <l>And thus it was, that when this sacred chain</l>

                    <l>That strength had failed her: haply it was well,</l>

                    <l>A few brief months—it might be only days,</l>

                    <l>In birds that fluttered on the joyous wing,</l>
                    <l>And firmer felt the ground beneath the tread,</l>

                    <l>Heard the old rook, that in the elm-tree sate,</l>
                    <l>Soothe his companions with a solemn caw,</l>
                    <l>Bidding them fear not—he no danger saw.</l>

                    <l>Rich beds, and costly curtains hung with taste,</l>

                    <l>But most on things they did not understand;</l>
                    <l>While some long treasured with peculiar care,</l>

                    <l>It was a sickening sight to one whose eve</l>

                    <l>Which curious trifling never yet could brook;</l>
                    <l>And many a tongue, as he drew near that day,</l>

                    <l>Attract attention, and invite regard;</l>

                    <l>Gazing—no busy meddler questioned why;</l>
                    <l>But gazing still, when all had passed him by—</l>
                    <l>For there were names prolonged amongst his herds</l>
                    <l>Through many generations—sacred words—</l>
                    <l>Mary, and Lucy—well could he recall</l>
                    <l>How, when, and where, they had been given to all;</l>
                    <l>And childish fancy had been pleased to hear</l>
                    <l>Strange application of those names so dear;</l>
                    <l>And one had smiled, who ne'er would smile again.</l>
                    <l>Away! away! ye bitter thoughts of pain!</l>
                    <l>That thrilling touch the spell of memory broke,</l>
                    <l>And from his dream of by-gone days he woke.</l>

                    <l>On the third morning met that crowd again,</l>

                    <l>And rare inventions, framed by modern skill,</l>

                    <l>Wagons, and carts, and carriages were there,</l>
                    <l>Curious machines, contrived the roots to tear</l>

                    <l>And great the loss that consequently fell</l>
                    <l>Upon this property, though loved so well,</l>
                    <l>And bought so eagerly each part had been;</l>

                    <l>Like troubled waters o'er his sinking soul.</l>

                    <l>He was alone, for younger hearts had been</l>
                    <l>Less patient, or less firm, to bear that scene.</l>
                    <l>Henry was busy at the neighbouring port,</l>
                    <l>Where they were both accustomed to resort</l>
                    <l>To sell their produce; but his errand now</l>
                    <l>Cast a far different look upon his brow.</l>
                    <l>Martha had kindly offered to the rest</l>
                    <l>Her hospitable home, where many a guest</l>
                    <l>Found peace and comfort. Could they ask for more?</l>
                    <l>Blessing was hers, in basket and in store,</l>
                    <l>For she had followed, not her woman's whim,</l>
                    <l>Nor fashion's ignis fatuus, vague, and dim;</l>
                    <l>But justice first had ruled with equal sway</l>
                    <l>Her guarded conduct, through each untried way;</l>
                    <l>Then generous feeling, with exhaustless store,</l>
                    <l>Followed, and strewed with flowers her pathway o'er.</l>
                    <l>This was the real luxury of life</l>
                    <l>To her, the recompense for all its strife.</l>
                    <l>And she had pleaded with her father oft</l>
                    <l>By strongest argument, persuasion soft,</l>
                    <pb n="282" xml:id="VAB7162-293"/>
                    <l>And all the touching eloquence of love,</l>
                    <l>Now in his trying hour, to let her prove</l>
                    <l>The blest experience of a real friend;</l>
                    <l>Through life's decline her kindness to extend;</l>
                    <l>As he had cherished her in early youth,</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>It might not be. He smiled, and shook his head.</l>
                    <l>“My child, I have another path to tread—</l>
                    <l>A sterner path; yet willingly I go.</l>
                    <l>Stay not my steps, and check thy tears of woe.</l>
                    <l>Though waves may flow between us, deep, and wide,</l>
                    <l>Nor time, nor space, affection can divide.</l>
                    <l>The same eternal Father will look down</l>
                    <l>Upon us both, our separate bliss to crown;</l>
                    <l>And prayer will find us at the mercy-seat,</l>

                    <l>Here then he leaned upon his staff, and stood,</l>
                    <l>Till the grey mist obscured the distant wood;</l>
                    <l>And wished to go, but could not break away</l>

                    <l>That hope foretells, amid despair profound—</l>
                    <l>Some tidings strange, that will not let us go,</l>

                    <l>Some spell around our parting footsteps cast—</l>
                    <l>Some voice to bid us stay, even at the last.</l>
                    <l>Is it, that from the fairy tales of youth,</l>
                    <l>We learn this lesson, rather than from truth?</l>
                    <l>Or that the human heart would surely break,</l>

                    <l>'Tis not the least, to drag from social ease</l>

                    <l>And she must learn to meet the wind and storm.</l>
                    <l>With other thoughts, he had enough to bear;</l>
                    <l>It was his chosen duty to prepare</l>
                    <l>All needful things—a task that suited best</l>

                    <l>But they were poor, and hardy—trained to toil,</l>

                    <l>Fair rosy girls, the wives of yesterday,</l>
                    <l>Gathered, and stowed their little wealth away,</l>
                    <l>In that small cabin, where the matron sate</l>
                    <l>With her poor babes, all ignorant of their fate.</l>
                    <l>And still the aged parent came to see,</l>
                    <l>With tears renewed, that scene of misery;</l>
                    <l>And friends flocked in, to make confusion worse,</l>
                    <l>And more confounded; till, with accents hoarse,</l>
                    <l>The impatient captain bade them all depart:</l>
                    <l>No time had he for sorrows of the heart.</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>The hour approached; and Emma's faith grew faint,</l>
                    <l>And faint alike her accents of complaint.</l>
                    <l>Her lip was pale, and quivering, and her hand</l>
                    <l>Relaxed its hold, when Henry's firm command</l>
                    <l>Bade her prepare; for he had tried all power</l>
                    <l>Of kindness to console her till that hour.</l>

                    <l>And now, while fled the life-blood from her cheek,</l>
                    <l>And sank her voice as if no more to speak,</l>
                    <l>He pressed one kiss of pity on her lip,</l>
                    <l>And bore her senseless to the heaving ship,</l>
                    <l>Placed her upon a couch with gentlest care,</l>
                    <l>And called on Phebe to attend her there.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Worse yet remained; for stronger hearts had now</l>

                    <l>All had been calm until the parting scene,</l>
                    <l>And great the strife to bear that hour had been;</l>
                    <l>But lovely cheeks had lost their rosy bloom,</l>
                    <l>And restless feet paced through the silent room</l>
                    <l>On fancied errand; though all things were done</l>

                    <l>A sad procession through the streets they passed,</l>
                    <l>No wandering look on either side was cast;</l>
                    <l>And Henry waited in the tossing boat,</l>
                    <l>While the rude sailor strained his lusty throat</l>
                    <l>With shouts that vainly bade them hasten on,</l>
                    <l>To leave the shore before the tide was gone.</l>

                    <l>Well was it then that gazing crowds stood by,</l>

                    <l>It seemed to stun the agony of heart</l>
                    <l>That William Herbert felt at last to part;</l>
                    <l>For Helen hung upon her father's neck,</l>
                    <l>Lost to all care her woman's tears to check;</l>
                    <l>And Martha's sobs of anguish came too near,</l>
                    <l>And too distinctly, to a parent's ear.</l>

                    <l>By which the vision of the aching eye</l>
                    <l>Its loved and lovely forms may yet descry.</l>

                    <l>Cold dreary twilight clothed the earth and sea;</l>

                    <l>For there were shrieking babes, untended all,</l>

                    <l>Of helpless wives. Most desolate of these</l>

                    <l>With her poor child, safe from the billows' roar.</l>
                    <l>Then did she pray for shelter from the storm,</l>
