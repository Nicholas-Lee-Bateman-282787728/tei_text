                            Governor, for the convening of the General Assembly having arrived, we

                            proceed with the call of the members' names, by counties.
                        
                            
                                
                                    The Secretary of the last session, (JAMER N. TYNER,) called
                                        the roll, and 42 Senators answered to their names, as

                        The PRESIDENT. There being present a quorum of the whole number of
                            Senators elected, the Senate will now proceed with its organization by
                            the election of a Principal and Assistant Secretary.
                        Mr. SLACK. I nominate THOMAS M. BROWNE, of Randolph county, for Principal
                            Secretary. The roll was called, and, Mr. Browne having received 42
                            votes-
                        The PRESIDENT said: THOMAS M. BROWNE having received a majority -a
                            unanimous vote- I hereby declare him elected Principal Secretary.
                        Mr. STUDABAKER. I move the nomination of WM. H. DRAPIER, of St. Joseph
                            county, as Assistant Secretary of the Senate.
                        
                            
                                
                                    The roll being called, Mr. DRAPIER received 41 votes.
                                
                            
                        
                        The PRESIDENT. Wm. H. Drapier, having received all the votes cast, he is
                            therefore unanimously elected Assistant Secretary of the Senate.
                        Mr. CONNER. I move that we now proceed to the election of a Principal
                            Doorkeeper, and nominate for that office SAMUEL G. THOMSON, of Wabash
                            county.
                        
                            
                                
                                    After the roll call the PRESIDENT declared Mr. Thomson
                                        elected - he having received 42 votes.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. LINE. I present the name of HENRY VANDEGRIFT, of Marion County, for
                            Assistant Doorkeeper.
                        
                            
                                
                                    After the roll call the PRESIDENT declared Mr. VANDEGRIFT
                                        elected, he having received 42 votes.
                                
                            
                        
                        The officers elect of the Senate then took the prescribed oath, at the
                            hands of JOHN PAUL JONES, Esq., Clerk of the Supreme Court, and
                            severally entered upon the discharge of their duties.
                        Mr. SLACK offered the following, which was adopted, by consent:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Secretary inform the
                                        House that the Senate has organized by electing Thomas M.
                                        Browne, Principal Secretary, William H. Drapier, Assistant
                                        Secretary Samuel G. Thomson, Doorkeeper, Henry Vandegrift,
                                        Assistant Doorkeeper, and that the Senate is now ready to
                                        proceed to business.
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            INDIANA LOYAL.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL offered the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That Indiana is a unit in
                                            sustaining the Government, in enforcing the laws,
                                            maintaining the Union of the States, and protecting the
                                            honor of the American flag, and to that end this
                                            Legislature will vote all the men and money
                                            necessary.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        And be it further resolved, That the
                                            Governor of the State be and he is hereby requested to
                                            hold and retain all the volunteers now in Camp Morton
                                            not included in the six regiments, until otherwise
                                            ordered by the Legislature.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL said that the Governor feels a responsibility in
                                reference to the retaining of these volunteers, and is anxious that
                                they may be retained.
                            Mr. STEELE. The main portion of that resolution I must subscribe to,
                                but I do not know whether it is policy to pass it at present. It
                                appears to me that we should have reserved troops; but whether it
                                would be proper to keep therm here when they could be kept at home
                                much cheaper, I am not able to say. I do take it that it is not
                                policy for this Legislature, at present, to pass these resolutions.
                                Although I am willing to vote every dollar and every man necessary
                                for the protection of that flag, I am not willing to vote an expense
                                that is not necessary. There should be no troops in this place at
                                the expense of the State. Today, with the exception of the
                                requisition from the President, they will amount to probably
                                forty-seven or eight hundred men. There is almost double the number
                                of troops here today that were demanded. Some troops that would have
                                been here, through my influence have been kept at home, in order not
                                to run the State into debt. Now the question is, whether we are
                                going to keep double the number of troops to spend all the money we
                                have got to spend before the war commences? I am willing to vote for
                                a large reserve, but let them be returned home; let them be kept
                                there where they will be kept off our expense. I am told there are
                                8,000 men here, and it is going to cost the State of Indiana  a sum we are not able to vote.
                                Let us count the cost before we commence.
                            Mr. WAGNER. I apprehend a majority of the Senate will want to go to
                                camp and hear the distinguished Senator from Illinois, [Mr.
                                Douglas,] and I apprehend that this resolution may be premature,
                                therefore I move that the Senate adjourn till to-morrow. I am in
                                favor of the resolutions - they are right exactly, but I think I see
                                a disposition to debate the question. If the Senate will come to a
                                vote, I withdraw my motion to adjourn.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. I apprehend that every Senator upon this floor will
                                vote for the resolution when they understand it. It is known that
                                many companies are in Camp Morton that are not enrolled in the six
                                regiments. They came upon the call of the Governor of the State, by
                                virtue of his requisition, and at the expense of the State of
                                Indiana, though it is true, without strictly legal authority. This
                                resolution simply contemplates that they shall be retained there
                                until the further order of this Legislature. To morrow, when this
                                Legislature convenes, they may discharge them. This resolution was
                                offered with a view of taking upon ourselves the responsibility of
                                holding them there.
                            Mr. STEELE. With that explanation I am satisfied. I understood that
                                the troops here were to be held until the call of the President. I
                                withdraw my objection.
                            The resolutions were then adopted.
                            On motion by Mr. Slack, the PRESIDENT appointed Senators Slack,
                                Claypool and Tarkington, "to act with a similar committee on the
                                part of the House, to wait upon the Governor, inform him of the
                                organization of the General Assembly, and ascertain at what time it
                                will suit his convenience to deliver his message to the General
                                Assembly."
                            Mr. STEELE. I had a conference with the committee appointed to wait
                                upon Judge Douglas, and they agreed to postpone his address. I will
                                say, for the information of the Senate, that I requested him to wait
                                his speech, as I thought the Legislature would like to hear him as
                                quick as their organization was over. The committee agreed, and
                                detained him till 3 1/2 o'clock.
                            Mr. LINE offered a resolution, which was adopted, directing the
                                Doorkeeper to place on members' desks, copies of the Secretary's
                                journal of the last session, the Revised Statutes, standing rules of
                                the Senate, and a copy of the acts of the last session, "or such
                                proportion of the same as can be obtained."
                            And then the Senate adjourned till to-morrow morning, 8 o'clock.
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            WEDNESDAY, April 24, 1861.
                        
                        The clerk of the former session, Hon. JONATHAN W. GORDON, called the
                            House to order at two o'clock, P. M., this day in conformity with the
                            Proclamation of His Excellency the Governor, dated April 17, 1861. He
                            stated that Mr. Speaker ALLEN had declined to take the chair till after
                            this proceeding.
                        
                            
                                
                                    He then called the roll, and 77 Representatives Responded,
                                        to-wit:
                                    Messrs. Anderson, Black, Brett, Brynn, Bundy, Burgess,
                                        Cameron, Campbell, Cason, Collins of Whitley, Collins of
                                        Adams, Combs, Cooprider, Crain, Dashiel, Davis, Dobbins,
                                        Edson, Epperson, Erwin, Ferguson, Fisher, Ford, Fordyce,
                                        Frazier, Gifford, Gore, Gresham, Hall, Harvey, Haworth,
                                        Hayes, Heffren, Henricks, Hopkins, Horton, Howard, Hudson,
                                        Hurd, Jenkinson, Jones of Vermillion, Jones, of Wayne,
                                        Kendrick, Lads, Lane, Lee, Lightner, McLean, Moormau, Moss,
                                        Nebeker, Orr, Packard, Parrett, Pitts, Polk, Prow, Randall,
                                        Roberts, Sherman, Sloan, Smith, of Bartholomew, Smith, of
                                        Miami, Stevenson, Stotsenburg, Treer, Thomas, Thompson,
                                        Turner, Underwood, Warrum, Wells, Williams, Wilson,
                                        Woodhull, Woods, Mr. Speaker.
                                
                            
                        
                        So it was declared that a quorum to do business was now present.
                        Mr. Speaker ALLEN. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives, as your
                            late Speaker, I here now resign that position. At the same time I
                            present the resignation of AZUR P. NEW-KIRK. Assistant Clerk, and JAMES
                            F. JOHNSTON, Principal Doorkeeper; and I also present a letter of
                            resignation on the part of JONATHAN W. GORDON, the Principal Clerk. The
                            letter was read as follows:
                        
                            
                                
                                    CAMP MORTON, Indiana, April 23,
                                        1861.
                                    
                                        Hon. CYRUS M. ALLEN,
                                            Speaker of the House of
                                                Representatives: DEAR SIR
                                    
                                    - The present condition of National affairs makes it improper
                                        and indeed impossible for me to remain at home to attend to
                                        the comparatively unimportant duties of Clerk of the House.
                                        A contest involving the existence of the Union and the
                                        Constitution has been thrust upon us by a combination of
                                        traitors whose power makes their efforts against the
                                        Government formidable, if not dangerous. We are called upon
                                        to aid the legitimate authority of the country in breaking
                                        up that combination, and if possible, extinguishing the last
                                        spark of treason against the freest and best Government in
                                        the world. I have resolved to render obedience to the call.
                                        I shall go with the armies of the Union to re-establish the
                                        Government in the full possession of all its rights of
                                        property, dominion and sovereignty in every part of the
                                        country, nothing doubting that the people of Indiana,
                                        through their General Assembly, will give us every
                                        encouragement necessary to our success in so good and so
                                        holy a cause; and that He who is supreme over both armies
                                        and people, will enable us to return in triumph, bringing
                                        back the star spangled banner with not a
                                        stripe erased nor polluted, nor a single star obscured, and
                                        still "bearing for its motto" that sentiment dear to every
                                        American heart"Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and
                                        inseparable."
                                    I have the honor to resign into your hands, and through you
                                        into those of the House, the office of Clerk of the House of
                                        Representatives of the General Assembly of Indiana, which I
                                        do with gratitude for the kindness and confidence that
                                        called me to so honorable a position.
                                    
                                        I am yours truly,
                                        J. W. GORDON.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            REORGANIZATION OF THE HOUSE.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Mr. Clerk, scarcely four months since, you and I met in
                                this Hall as members of two opposite political parties. At that time
                                the honorable gentleman from Knox, (Mr. Allen,) was selected as a
                                candidate for Speaker of this House, by one of those political
                                parties, and I was selected as the candidate of the other political
                                party. Times have changed. The Union that you and I love, and we all
                                love - the star spangled banner, which my hands and the hands of my
                                gray haired friend here, assisted in raising over the dome of this
                                building, is in danger. Union and harmony and concession should now
                                be our motto. Our coming together now falls upon a time when our
                                country is menaced with danger, and when our homes and our firesides
                                should be protected. It is therefore that on  this occasion, I take great pleasure
                                in having the privilege of nominating for Speaker of the House of
                                Representatives, the Hon. Cyrus M. Allen, of the county of Knox.
                            The CLERK announced the order of the vote to be viva
                                    voce, which being taken resulted as follows:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Whole number of votes cast 88, of which Cyrus M. Allen
                                            received all.
                                        So the election was declared unanimous.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The CLERK called on Messrs. Heffren, Gresham and Burgess to conduct
                                the Speaker to the chair; which service being performed - The
                                SPEAKER. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: - In this
                                renewed manifestation of your confidence, you will accept my
                                heartfelt thanks. The unanimity with which I have been called to
                                preside over your deliberations during this session, evidences to me
                                that we have come up here actuated sincerely by the desire to
                                promote the interests of our country, the Union, the Constitution
                                and the institutions of civil and religious liberty.
                            It affords me great pleasure to be able to say that we come up here
                                divested of all party prejudices and actuated by the single,
                                unanimous desire to promote the best interests of our whole
                                country.
                            We come together under extraordinary circumstances and upon an
                                extraordinary occasion. We have been called together by the
                                proclamation of the Governor to consider questions arising out of
                                the present excited state of the country. Of the reasons for that
                                call it does not become me to say anything by way of address at this
                                time. It is for us, when the Governor advises, to act promptly and
                                efficiently for the best interests of the whole country.
                            The House will now proceed to the election of a Principal Clerk, that
                                being the first business in order.
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Mr. FISHER. I nominate H. M. Crawford, of Floyd county.
                                            No other nominations being offered, the election
                                            proceeded, and Mr. Crawford was unanimously elected - 85
                                            members voting, and thereupon he received the oath and
                                            entered upon the duties of his office.
                                    
                                
                            
                            A message from the Senate, by Mr. Tyner, late Secretary, announced
                                that that body is organized by the election of the usual

                            On the motion of Mr. FRASIER, Mr. CHARLES G. CHAPMAN, elected

                                colleague, the honorable Thomas G. Boydston, deceased, came forward,
                                received the oath of the Constitution, and took his seat.
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Mr. BUNDY nominated John Mathes for Doorkeeper, and he
                                            also was unanimously elected - receiving 85 votes.

                                            Governor, be directed to make provision for the
                                            accommodation of all military companies now here and not
                                            mustered into the service of the United States, until
                                            otherwise ordered by the General Assembly.

                            On the motion of Mr. CAMERON, it was

                            This order being duly executed, with hearty applause and cheerings -
                                and it being formally announced that Judge Douglas was to speak to

                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            THURSDAY, April 25, 1861.
                        
                        Mr. LINE offered a resolution, which was adopted, making the rules of the
                            last Senate in full force during the present session.

                            Principal Secretary to employ one assistant, the Assistant Secretary
                            two, and the Doorkeeper, one messenger and two pages.

                        
                            THE VOLUNTEER SOLDIERY,
                            On motion by Mr. STEELE it was
                            Ordered,That the Governor be requested to inform
                                the Senate of the number of companies now in Camp Morton mustered
                                and sworn into the service, also the number of companies offered
                                from the different counties of the State that can be ready for
                                service at short notice, also the order in which they are presented
                                here.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON offered the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Adjutant General be instructed to
                                            receive and organize the forty-nine companies of the
                                            Indiana volunteers who have reported themselves to said
                                            Department and who have not been received as part of the
                                            six regiments, and that they be held ready for a further
                                            call of the General Government, or directions from the
                                            present General Assembly.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. CONNER moved that the resolution be referred to the
                                    committee on military affairs.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON. I do not see any objection. I have been induced to
                                offer the resolution from the fact that a great many companies have
                                not been received, and a portion of the 49 companies are in
                                encampment. The motion to refer was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            NEWSPAPERS FOR MEMBERS.
                            Mr. SLACK offered the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Door-keeper procure,
                                            for the use of the Senate, three copies each of the Daily Journal and Daily
                                                Sentinel, for each member and officer of the
                                            Senate, two copies of each to be stamped and enveloped,
                                            and that the price therefor be the same that was paid at
                                            the last session of this Senate.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. WAGNER. I hope this Senate will not be cumbered with these daily
                                papers again. As far as I am concerned, I scarcely ever sent them
                                out, and they are not even a favor for which I  would thank the State. I hope that
                                gentlemen I who will not accept them will be exempt from the
                                provisions of the resolution.
                            Mr. HAMILTON. My experience in this matter is similar to that of the
                                Senator from Warren. There is no earthly use, it appears to me, to
                                spend the people's money in this way.
                            Mr. LINE. For the purpose of testing the sense of the Senate, I move
                                to strikeout the word "three" and insert "one."
                            Mr. STEELE. I do not want to be factious, but I do think that three
                                papers is not too much one for each member to read, and two to send
                                home. Many counties have papers that have no exchanges with the
                                dailies of this city, and we want to send copies to such. I prefer
                                that the amendment should not pass.
                            
                                
                                    
                                        The amendment was rejected, and the original resolution
                                            adopted by yeas 18, nays 17.
                                    
                                
                            
                            [Mr. SLACK, from the select committee appointed to wait upon the
                                Governor, reported that the message of the Governor would be
                                delivered In the hall of the House to-day at 10 o'clock, A.M.]
                        
                        
                            NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                            The following bills were introduced and severally passed to the first
                                reading:

                                equipment of the same, and fixing the compensation of the officers

                                Divisions of the military volunteers of the State of Indiana, when
                                preparing for or in actual service; laid on the table and ordered
                                printed.
                            By Mr. MILLER: [S. 4] Supplementary to an act entitled an act
                                defining felonies and prescribing punishment therefor ; approved
                                June 10, 1852. Laid on the table, and 200 copies ordered
                                printed.
                            By Mr. CRAVENS of Jefferson: [S. 5] To define certain felonies, and
                                to provide for the punishment of persons guilty thereof. Laid on the

                            By Mr. CLAYPOOL: [S. 6] To authorize the Board of County
                                Commissioners of the several counties in the State of Indiana, and
                                the authorities of any incorporated city or town in said State to
                                make appropriation in certain cases, and legalize certain
                                appropriations therein specified.

                                and others that may become witnesses from the trial of any cause in
                                this State, and providing punishment therefor.
                            Mr. WAGNER hoped we would not have any general legislation, for the
                                general feeling is to suspend the whole operations of the courts for
                                the time being.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER. If the Senate saw proper to take that course, it
                                would be in compliance with his ideas; he should not press his
                                bill.
                            On motion by Mr. WOLFE it was -
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That in the opinion of the
                                            Senate it is inexpedient to enter into matters of
                                            general legislation at the present session of the
                                            Legislature, beyond what may be recommended by the
                                            Governor, and what may be necessary to supply such
                                            casual omissions as may have occurred in the legislation

                                        Resolved, That the Committee

                            Mr. STUDABAKER offered the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Military Affairs be instructed to
                                            inquire into the expediency of returning home all
                                            volunteer troops over and above that required to fill
                                            the requisition of the President upon this State, and
                                            that they report at the earliest practicable
                                            opportunity.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. STUDABAKER. There is no danger that while the excitement is up we
                                will run too fast. We had better economize as much as we can, and
                                examine this question as early as we can, so as to save expense to
                                the State.
                            Mr. WAGNER. The effect of this resolution will only be to create
                                excitement among these men. It is the intention of some of us to
                                test the sense of this Legislature as to whether it will organize
                                these men into an army absolutely. The bill on this subject will be
                                pressed to a vote as soon as it can be. We must immediately
                                determine whether we take or refuse to take them.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER. Can we ever take action without creating the
                                excitement which the  gentleman
                                deprecates? The argument, then, is, that if the Legislature see
                                proper to retain these troops here, that kind of action will create
                                no excitement; but if we see proper to send them home, that kind of
                                action will produce excitement. I did not know that a bill had been
                                introduced which will bring up the question, but so understanding
                                it, I withdraw the resolution.
                            Mr. MURRAY offered the following, which was adopted by consent:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Banks inquire into and report whether
                                            any legislation is necessary to maintain the credit of
                                            the banks of this State against financial embarrassments
                                            in consequence of the present war upon the United States
                                            Government.

                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Military Affairs be instructed to
                                            inquire into the possibility of the State furnishing
                                            arms to companies organized for home defense at cost
                                            price.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The Senate then repaired to the Hall of the House for the purpose of
                                receiving the message of Governor Morton.
                            When Senators returned
                            The Senate took a recess till 2 o'clock.

                                disruption, therefore,
                            
                                
                                    
                                        1. Be it Resolved by the General Assembly of
                                                the State of Indiana, That we, the
                                            Representatives of a free people who love liberty and
                                            hate despotism and anarchy, determined to preserve our
                                            institutions as handed down to us by the Fathers
                                            unsullied, do hereby tender to the General Government
                                            all the aid, both in men and means, which this
                                            Commonwealth can afford, to put down treason, preserve
                                            the Union, enforce the laws and perpetuate the liberties
                                            of the people.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        2. Resolved, That we call upon all true
                                            American citizens, irrespective of party, to rally in
                                            solid phalanx to the rescue of their common country,
                                            pledging their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred
                                            honor to redeem it from the danger in which it has been
                                            placed by the hands of traitors.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        3. Resolved, That the Governor be
                                            requested to transmit a copy of these resolutions
                                            forthwith to the President of the United States.
                                    
                                
                            
                            On motion by Mr. HEFFREN, by unanimous consent, it was
                            Ordered, That the proposition be referred to a
                                select committee of one from each Congressional District.
                            The Speaker subsequently constituted this committee as follows: First
                                District, Mr. Veatch; Second District, Mr. Heffren; Third District,
                                Mr. Bingham; Fourth District, Mr. Roberts; Fifth District, Mr.
                                Haworth; Sixth District, Mr. Warrum; Seventh District, Mr. Grain;
                                Eighth District, Mr. McClurg; Ninth District, Mr. Hurd; Tenth
                                District, Mr. Jenkinson; Eleventh District, Mr. Fisher; Mr. Roberts,
                                Chairman.
                            Mr. LANE desired an early appointment of the committee, and a report
                                as soon as possible.
                        
                        
                            PRAYERS.
                            A message from the Senate announced a concurrent resolution for
                                opening the business of the session with prayers.
                            On motion by Mr. BUNDY it was taken up.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG proposed to amend by requiring daily prayers, but was
                                dissuaded from pressing it here.
                        
                        
                            RULES.
                            On motion by Mr. BUNDY it was
                            Ordered, That the Standing Rules and Joint Rules of
                                the last session of the General Assembly be adopted a the Rules of
                                this session till changed or modified.
                        
                        
                            NEWSPAPERS.
                            Mr. HAYS submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Doorkeeper be
                                            directed to contract with the publishers of the Indiana State Sentinel and the Indiana State Journal for three copies
                                            of their respective papers for each member of the House
                                            of Representatives during the present session two copies
                                            to be enveloped and stamped; also six copies of the two
                                            German papers and one of the Indiana
                                                American, published in this city.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. GRAIN was not willing, and would not consent to take more than
                                one copy of the two papers first named in the resolution. We have
                                too much to pay for military purposes to allow of this expenditure. 
                            


                            Mr. ROBBINS hoped the number of copies would be made specific this
                                time. He was in favor of taking at least three copies each of the
                                    State Sentinel and State
                                    Journal.
                            Mr. HEFFREN had thousands of constituents unable to read the English
                                language, and he named other Representatives who could say the same.
                                He considered that the rejection of the German papers in the
                                resolution would be treating these people with neglect and contempt.
                                We always had taken the Journal and Sentinel, and we might now talk about the matter half a
                                day or so, and we would take them then; and while raking these he
                                would say let us take the German papers also, as a claim of right,
                                that those whose eyes first beheld the light of the sun in another
                                country may have still something like an equal privilege of seeing
                                what we are doing here.
                            Mr. FRASIER would just as soon not take any paper at all. They were
                                more a nuisance than anything else. They were never promptly sent to
                                the people. They kept coming to his constituents some time after he
                                returned home from the regular session. This was to be a session of
                                not probably more than eight or ten days, and these papers would not
                                reach the people till after we shall get home.
                            Mr. DAVIS was uniformly against any unnecessary public expense; but
                                it seemed to him that the present condition of the country demanded
                                this resolution. The people were never more desirous of the news
                                than at this time. He was willing, therefore, and more anxious than
                                ever before, that they should see what we do here now; and, as far
                                as he was concerned, a part of them should have this information, if
                                he paid for it out of his own pocket.
                            Mr. PARRETT noticed that this dislike to taking papers came chiefly
                                from us who live in the backwoods. He looked to the service of all
                                the people of the State: and whether the people of Elkhart and
                                Lagrange were better accommodated in this respect than those of
                                other counties was no question with him. He believed, with the
                                gentleman from Scott, (Mr. Davis,) that the little expense of these
                                papers would be repaid to the State a thousand fold. The news in the
                                morning's papers before us was worth more than the money involved in
                                this resolution. He wanted also the German papers.
                            Mr. FRASIER made an ineffectual motion to lay the resolution on the
                                table.
                            Mr. BUNDY proposed to substitute one copy for each member, of the State Journal and State
                                Sentinel.
                            Mr. RAGAN was generally on the parsimonious side of all questions;
                                but, when it comes to disseminating light, he hoped the House would
                                not hesitate at a reasonable expenditure. His policy had been to
                                send the papers publishing our proceedings here to his country
                                constituents, where they do not get the news daily. The importance
                                of the matter before us, and the exciting character of the times,
                                admonish us to be liberal in this respect. He hoped the original
                                resolution would pass.
                            Mr. DOBBINS. There seemed to be a more extensive demand among his
                                people for information from the Legislature than ever before.
                                Hundreds of men from all parts of his county had urged him to send
                                them the papers, stating that they were perfectly willing to be
                                taxed for them that they would be willing to pay for double the
                                number actually taken. He moved to lay Mr. Bundy's substitute on the
                                table.
                            The motion was agreed to - yeas 55, nays 32.
                            Mr. PACKARD moved to amend the resolution by striking out the Indiana American. He did this on acccount of the
                                following paragraph, printed in that paper of the 23d inst:
                            MARK THE TRAITORS - Of course, Ray and Conley and Cobb and Wolfe, and
                                such men in the Senate, and Heffren and Packard and Dobbins in the
                                House, having emboldened the traitors to strike the flag of our
                                country, under assurance that they would sanction the treason, will
                                not forget their brethren of the South, now that they have induced
                                them to do a mean thing.
                            Mr. DOBBINS had stated before from his place here, that he did not
                                care what that reverend editor might say about him. He was willing
                                to submit his record to honest men everywhere, as to whether he had
                                ever deserted his country's flag. The charge came from the heart of
                                a man who had himself been constantly fighting against the interests
                                of that flag, and who was a traitor at heart to the best government
                                in the civilized world. Such was the man bringing this charge
                                against him. He regarded it not, and he hoped the Legislature would
                                not distinguish him with any stigma, nor with any notice
                                whatever.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. If this were the first time that editor had attacked him
                                and his course here, he would not, perhaps, regard it so lightly.
                                But we have got used to it. Nobody pays any attention to him. He is
                                a disgrace to his calling and his city, and a coward at heart.
                            Mr. PROSSER. If he is so bad as that, I am not in favor of voting the
                                people's money for the purpose of keeping up his press.
                            Mr. PARRETT. Although Mr. Goodwin was his friend, he would vote for
                                the amendment.
                            Mr. FERGUSON moved to lay the resolution and amendment on the
                                table.
                            On a division, the House refused to lay the amendment on the
                                table.
                            Mr. ORR. If the editor of the American is a friend
                                of our country and a supporter of the laws, I am for retaining his
                                paper. We are not here to take notice of personal matters.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG demanded the previous question, and there was a
                                second.
                            Mr. Packard's amendment was adopted - yeas 70, nays 16.
                            Mr. PROSSER. Neither of the German papers is a daily.
                            The resolution, as amended, was then adopted - yeas 58, nays 31.
                            Mr. BITNDY, from the select committee to wait on the Governor,
                                reported that they had performed that duty, and were informed that
                                His Excellency would communicate his message this day at half past
                                ten o'clock.
                            Mr. ORR, submitted a resolution, which was adopted, admitting
                                reporters for the press to desks within the bar.
                        
                        
                            RETURNING VOLUNTEERS.
                            A message from the Senate announced the passage of a joint resolution
                                authorizing the Governor to make arrangements for the return home it
                                the cost of the State of such volunteers as have been discharged and
                                may desire to go home.
                            
                            On motion of Mr. FISHER, this resolution was at once considered and
                                adopted - yeas 80, nays 0.
                            Mr. HEFFREN submitted an order, which was adopted, inviting the
                                Senate into a joint session to hear the message, &c.
                        
                        
                            STATIONERY.
                            Mr. HEFFREN submitted an order, which was adopted, that the State
                                Librarian furnish the House with stationery for the session through
                                the Principal and Assistant Clerks to be obtained by the Librarian
                                through the Secretary of State.
                        
                        
                            TREASON - ITS PUNISHMENT.
                            Mr. GRAIN introduced a bill [No. 1] entitled, An act declaring and
                                defining what shall be treason against the State of Indiana, and
                                prescribing the punishment therefor; declaring who are accessories
                                thereto, and the punishment therefor: which was passed to the second
                                reading.
                            Mr. FRASIER. A bill [2] to amend section three of the act entitled an
                                act providing for the election, and prescribing certain duties of
                                the Clerk of the Supreme Court, approved May 13, 1852.
                            Mr. NEBEKER objected to the introduction of this bill, believing that
                                we ought not now to go into general legislation. For this reason
                                alone he moved that the bill be rejected, and not from any
                                disrespect to the author of the bill.
                            Mr. HEFFREN also objected to going now into general legislation,
                                except as to the indispensable work on the school law, &c., but
                                preferred that this bill be allowed by courtsey to go to the second
                                reading.
                            Mr. FRASIER supposed it was understood that there were some matters
                                in legislation which had been omitted in the regular session. This
                                was a bill of that character. It contained matter which should have
                                been incorporated into one of the bills of the regular session, and
                                he had put it in with that view.
                            Mr. Nebeker's motion was rejected; so the bill by Mr. Frasier was
                                passed to the second reading.
                            Mr. McLEAN submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That it is the sense of this
                                            House that no business in general legislation be
                                            transacted during the present session, except such
                                            legislation as may be deemed of special and immediate
                                            interest to the people of the State.
                                    
                                
                            
                            It was adopted by consent.
                            Mr. VEATCH introduced a bill [3] to authorize the Board of
                                Commissioners of the several counties, and the corporate authorities
                                of each of the cities and incorporated towns in this State, to make
                                appropriations for defense against invasion and unlawful violence,
                                and to authorize them to levy a tax therefor, and to authorize such
                                appropriations already made.
                            On motion of Mr. HEFFREN, the rules and constitutional provision were
                                suspended, and the bill was passed to the second reading, and
                                referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
                            The SPEAKER stated here that the committees would stand as they were
                                for the present. A few changes were contemplated in the committees
                                on Ways and Means, on Military affairs, and on the Judiciary.
                        
                        
                            EXEMPTION.
                            Mr. HOLCOMBE presented the petition of sundry citizens, praying for a
                                law prohibiting seizure or sale of property of any citizen of the
                                State who may enter the military service of the Government during
                                the term of their service; which was referred to the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary.
                            The SPEAKER laid before the House the proceedings of a public meeting
                                of citizens of Laporte county - A. L. Osborn in the chair - asking
                                for a law to authorize the Boards of County Commissioners to make
                                such appropriations as they may deem necessary and proper for the
                                relief of families of volunteers to aid in the suppression of the
                                Southern rebellion.
                        
                        
                            POSTAGE.
                            Mr. ROBBINS submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Door-keeper of the
                                            House be instructed to procure, for the use of each
                                            member and officer of the House, one dollar's worth of
                                            postage stamps.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. FRASIER proposed two dollars' worth.
                            Mr. CASON. This is uncalled for. Let us pay our own postage. I move
                                to lay the resolution and amendment on the table.
                            On a division of this question, only the amendment was laid on the
                                table.
                            Mr. RAGAN suggested, that the late and very valuable report of the
                                Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the report of the
                                    Committee on Investigation of the Northern
                                    Penitentiary, printed since the adjournment of the
                                regular session, were yet undistributed.
                            The resolution was adopted, - yeas 53, nay 33.
                        
                        
                            JOINT CONVENTION FOR THE MESSAGE,
                            At 10 1/2 o'clock, according to previous arrangement, the Senators
                                appeared in the Hall, and were seated on the right - the President
                                of the Senate on the right of the Speaker.
                            The PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE. By a concurrent resolution this morning
                                adopted, this joint session of the General Assembly will be opened
                                with prayer. The Rev. Mr. Nixon will now address the Throne of
                                Divine Grace.
                            The prayers having been said -
                            The PRESIDENT. Gentlemen, you have to-day been convened, in
                                compliance with a requirement of the constitution of our State, to
                                receive any communication which His Excellency, the Governor, may
                                have to make to you. That officer being now present, he will
                                communicate with you in person.
                            Governor MORTON then advanced, and standing behind the Speaker's
                                table, read the following:
                            Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives:
                            You have been summoned together under circumstances of the most grave
                                and important character. Our country is placed in a condition
                                hitherto unknown in her history, and one which all patriots and
                                lovers of liberty throughout the world had fondly hoped would never
                                occur. Civil war, that has ever been the bane of Republics, has been
                                inaugurated by certain rebellious States, which, unmindful of their
                                constitutional obligations, and regarding not our common history,
                                blood, interests, and institutions, are seeking to dishonor the
                                Nation, and overthrow the Federal Government, so wisely, and, as we
                                had hoped, permanently established by our fathers.
                            The origin of this most wicked rebellion dates  back more than thirty years. It is
                                well known that distinguished Southern statesmen, as early as 1820,
                                cherished the dream of a vast Southern glaveholding confederacy,
                                comprehending the conquest of Cuba, Mexico, and Central America. The
                                determination was then formed to break our Republic into pieces by
                                any available pretext. The first one seized upon by South Carolina
                                was the Tariff question, and had not the Nation had for its
                                Executive a man greatly distinguished for patriotism, courage, and
                                decision of character, wide-spreading and disastrous consequences
                                might have followed. By prompt and energetic action, the rebellion
                                was crushed out for the time, to be revived, as subsequent events
                                have shown, on new features and in another form.
                            The election of a President of the United States, through the forms
                                of the Constitution, entertaining opinions obnoxious to certain
                                States of the Confederacy, is boldly published to the world as just
                                cause for the dissolution of the Union, and bringing on if necessary
                                for that purpose all the horrors of a bloody revolution. It would be
                                an insult to your intelligence to argue that the admission of this
                                pretense as a justification would be clearly fatal to all Republican
                                Government; that popular institutions can only be sustained by
                                submission to the will of the people as expressed through the forms
                                of the Constitution, trusting to the peaceful remedy of the ballot
                                box for the redress of grievances. And the wickedness of this
                                pretence is greatly aggravated by the reflection that it is utterly
                                hypocritical, that was only put forward in furtherance of schemes
                                entertained for years and supported by notoriously false assumptions
                                of fact and logic. When we read the history of the late Democratic
                                Convention at Charleston, by the light of subsequent events, can we
                                fail to see that the scheme of secession and dismemberment of the
                                Union was one of the steps towards its consummation? If confirmation
                                of this opinion were needed, it will be found in the fact that
                                certain traitorous members of Mr. Buchanau's cabinet were
                                systematically engaged for many months before the late Presidential
                                election, in placing the arms and defences of the nation in a
                                position to be readily seized by the seceding States.
                            Secession was first argued as a right springing from the Constitution
                                itself, but as the movement gained strength, the flimsy pretext was
                                abandoned, and ceased to be a subject of discussion, and what in an
                                hour of weakness was claimed by feeble argument, is now boldly
                                asserted by military power.
                            The North, conscious of her strength, and the rectitude of her
                                intentions, has hitherto remained quiet, making no preparations
                                whatever for a conflict of arms. Her forbearance has been construed
                                into, cowardice, and her efforts to keep the peace have but provoked
                                increased insolence and aggression. The secession movement has from
                                its beginning been an act of war. Ordinances of secession have been
                                immediately followed and sometimes preceded by the violent seizure
                                and plunder of national property, and the forcible expulsion of the
                                agents and officers of the Federal Government. From the very first,
                                and at every step in its progress, it has been distinguished by acts
                                of hostility and outrage, alike injurious to the nation and
                                insulting to the people of the loyal States.
                            The secessionists were profoundly convinced that the co-operation of
                                the border slave States could not be procured without a conflict of
                                arms between them and the Federal Government, and hence have labored
                                assiduously to place the Government in a position that a collision
                                could not be avoided except by the most abject submission and
                                humiliation. The intention to force a conflict has been most
                                apparent, and delay was suffered only that they might complete their
                                preparations; and when at last their preparations were complete, and
                                wearied by the long forbearance of the Government, they inaugurated
                                hostilities by assaulting and reducing Fort Sumter.
                            The place where Fort Sumter is situated had been regularly ceded by
                                the State of South Carolina to the Federal Government, and by an
                                express provision of the Constitution was under the exclusive
                                jurisdiction of the United States. It was unfinished and held by a
                                garrison of less than one hundred men, and while in this condition
                                was invested by a large army. The stock of provisions was almost
                                exhausted, and the immediate prospect was presented to the feeble
                                garrison of starvation, or yielding up into the hands of an armed
                                and avowed enemy a fortress of the United States. At this juncture
                                the Federal Government, which had waited long, perhaps too long,
                                declared its determination to send provisions to the feeble
                                garrison. Before this attempt could be made, and before a single
                                sail of the fleet was seen off the harbor, a powerful cannonade was
                                opened upon Sumter, which resulted in its destruction and
                                surrender.
                            Every day brings us intelligence of new outrages and assaults.
                                Throughout the rebellious States is heard the note of preparation
                                for an extensive and aggressive campaign. The National Capital is
                                menaced, and every avenue of approach for Federal troops and
                                provisions is attempted to be cut off. The free navigation of the
                                Mississippi river, the great artery of commerce of the Northwest, is
                                obstructed, and the usurping government of the rebellious States has
                                issued a proclamation inviting the freebooters of all the world to
                                prey upon our National commerce.
                            We have passed from the field of argument to the solemn fact of war
                                which exists by the act of the seceding States. The issue is forced
                                upon us and must be accepted. Every man must take his position upon
                                the one side or upon the other. In time of war there is no ground
                                upon which a third party can stand. It is the imperative duty of all
                                men to rally to the support of the Government, and to expend in its
                                behalf, if need be, their fortunes and their blood. Upon the
                                preservation of this Government depends our prosperity and greatness
                                as a nation- our liberty and happiness as individuals. We should
                                approach the contest not as politicians, nor as ambitions partisans,
                                but as patriots who cast aside every selfish consideration when
                                danger threatens their country. The voice of party should be hushed,
                                and the bitterness that may have sprung out of politicial contests
                                be at once forgiven and forgotten. Let us rise above these paltry
                                considerations, and inaugurate the era when there shall be but one
                                party, and that for our country. The struggle is one into which we
                                enter with the deepest reluctance. We are bound to the people of the
                                seced-  ing States by the
                                dearest ties of blood and institutions. They are our brothers and
                                our fellow countrymen, but if they regard not these tender
                                relations, how can we? If they wage war upon us, and put themselves
                                in the attitude of public enemies, they must assume all the
                                responsibilities incident to that position. But while I deplore
                                deeply the character of the contest in which we are engaged,
                                nevertheless we should meet it as men.
                            To our sister State of Kentucky we turn with hope and affection. She
                                has grown rich and prosperous in the Republic; could she do more if
                                she was out of it? It would, be a sad day that would sever the bond
                                which binds these States together, and place us in separate and
                                hostile nations. I appeal to her by the ties of our common kindred
                                and history; by our community of interest; by the sacred obligations
                                to maintain the Constitution inviolate, to adhere to the Union, and
                                stand fast by that flag in defense of which she has so often shed
                                her best blood. I pray her to examine her past history and perceive
                                how the tide of her prosperity has flowed on unbroken, and ever
                                increasing, until her limits are filled with material wealth, and
                                her people respected, elevated and happy; and then inquire if all
                                this is not the result of that Union she is called upon to break,
                                and of that Government she is invited to dishonor and overthrow. To
                                ask Kentucky to secede, is to ask her to commit foul dishonor and
                                suicide. I trust that the good sense and patriotism of her people
                                will not suffer her to be dragged by the current of evils, which has
                                been cunningly invented for that purpose, into the vortex of
                                disunion: nor permit her to be artfully inveigled into an armed
                                neutrality between the rebellious States and the Federal Government.
                                Such a position would be anomalous and fatal to the peace and
                                perpetuity of the Union. There is no ground in the Constitution
                                midway between a rebellious State and the Federal Government, upon
                                which she can stand, holding both in check and restraining the
                                Federal Government from the enforcement of the laws and the exercise
                                of its constitutional authority.
                            Such an attitude is at once unconstitutional and hostile. At a time
                                like this, if she is not for the Government, and for maintaining it
                                by the observance of all her constitutional obligations, she is
                                against it. If the voice of her people can be heard, I fear not the
                                result. Secession can only triumph, as it has in other States, by
                                stifling the voice of the people, and by the bold usurpations by
                                demagogues and traitors of the powers which rightfully belong to
                                them alone. And, I might here remark, it is quite manifest that the
                                schemes of the authors and managers of the rebellion extend far
                                beyond the dissolution of the Union, and embrace the destruction of
                                the Democratic principle of government, and the substitution of an
                                aristocracy in its stead. In the seceding States the control of
                                public affairs has been withdrawn, substantially from the people,
                                and every proposition to submit to their consideration measures of
                                the most vital importance, has been contemptuously overruled; and we
                                are, in truth, called upon to fight not only for the Union, but for
                                the principle upon which our State and National Governments are
                                founded.
                            If the rebellious States hope to profit by the dissensions in the
                                North, they have erred egregiously, and have wholly failed to
                                comprehend our people. Our divisions were mere political and not
                                fundamental; and party lines faded instantly from sight when the
                                intelligence went abroad that war was being waged against the
                                Nation. When the sound of the first gun reverberated through the
                                land, the people of the North arose as one man, and declared that
                                the Government must be sustained and the honor of our flag preserved
                                in violate at whatever cost. The events of the last ten days are
                                pregnant with instruction and moral grandeur. They present the
                                action of a people who have suffered much and waited long; who were
                                slow to take offense and were incredulous of treason and danger; but
                                who, when the dread appeal to arms was made, and the issue could no
                                longer be avoided with honor or safety, promptly abandoned the
                                peaceful pursuits of life and devoted themselves to the service of
                                their country I trust that the force of this lesson may not be lost
                                upon our erring brethren of the South, and that they will at once
                                perceive they have inaugurated a contest from which they can not
                                emerge with honor or profit.
                            On the 15th day of the present month the President of the United
                                States issued his proclamation calling upon the loyal States to
                                furnish 75,000 men for the protection of the Government, the
                                suppression of rebellion and the enforcement o the laws subsequently
                                the quota to be furnished by Indiana was fixed at six regiments of
                                seven hundred and seventy men each. In obedience to this call I
                                issued my proclamation calling for volunteers, and in less than
                                eight days more than 12,000 men have tendered their services, and
                                the contest among the companies has been earned and exciting as to
                                which should secure a place within the quota. This response has been
                                most gratifying and extraordinary, and furnishes indubitable
                                evidence of the patriotism of Indiana, and her entire devotion to
                                the Union. Without distinction of party, condition or occupation,
                                men have rallied around the national standard, and in every part of
                                the State may be heard the sound of martial music and witnessed the
                                mustering of companies into the field.
                            In view of this remarkable response made to the proclamation on the
                                30th inst., I tendered to the President, for the service of the
                                United States, six additional regiments, but telegraph and postal
                                communication having been cut off with Washington, no answer has
                                been received up to this time. A camp was formed in the neighborhood
                                of this city for the reception of the troops, and Major Wood, of the
                                United States army, has been busily engaged for several days in
                                mustering them into the service. There are in the camp companies,
                                being an excess of the number called for by the President, and, in
                                addition to that, every company largely exceeds, and in some
                                instances more than doubles, the number that can be finally received
                                into the company, Some companies came, by mistakes unavoidably
                                occurring in the office of the Adjutant General, and others without
                                marching orders. They will be retained in camp, and provided with
                                quarters and subsistence, awaiting the action of the Legislature. I
                                can not refrain from here expressing the opinion  that has been uttered by many who have
                                visited she camp, that finer material for a gallant army wits never
                                assembled.
                            The report of the Adjutant General, Lewis Wallace, is herewith
                                transmitted, and I beg leave hi this manner to tender him my hearty
                                thanks for his able and efficient services in that department.
                            In view of all the facts, it becomes the imperative duty of Indiana
                                to make suitable preparations for the contest by providing ample
                                supplies of men and money to insure the protection of the State and
                                support the General Government in the prosecution of the war to a
                                speedy and successful termination. I therefore recommend that one
                                million of dollars be appropriated for the purchase of arms and
                                munitions of war, and for the organization of such portions [of the
                                militia as may be deemed necessary for the emergency; that a militia
                                system be devised and enacted, looking chiefly to volunteers, and
                                which shall ensure the greatest protection to the State, and unity
                                and efficiency of the force to be employed; that a law be enacted
                                defining and punishing treason against the State; that a law be
                                enacted suspending the collection of debts against those who may be
                                actually employed in the military service of the State or the United
                                States; that suitable provision be made by the issue of the bonds of
                                the State or otherwise for raising the money herein recommended to
                                be appropriated; and that all necessary and proper legislation be
                                had to protect the business, property, and citizens of the State
                                under the circumstances in which they are placed.
                            O. P. MORTON.
                            Mr. HEFFREN submitted an order to print 5,000 copies of the
                                Governor's Message for the use of the House of Representatives -
                                2,000 copies of which shall be in the German language and that the
                                State Printer be requested to furnish said copies at the earliest
                                possible moment.
                            Mr. CAMERON proposed 1,000 copies in German.
                            Mr. RAGAIST proposed to increase the whole number to 10,000.
                            Mr. DAVIS. Needless to order so large a number. We never got the
                                large number of messages printed by order of the last session.
                            Mr. BUNDY proposed to compromise on 5,000 copies in English and 2,000
                                copies in German, which was agreed to.
                            Mr. PARRETT proposed an order, which was adopted, for a special
                                committee of three to see that the messages are duly delivered to
                                members. Whereupon the SPEAKER appointed Messrs. Parrett, Davis and
                                Ragan.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            Mr. COLLINS of Adams submitted the following:
                            WHEREAS, differences of opinion prevail among County Surveyors in
                                this State, in reference to the proper manner of subdividing
                                exterior quarter sections on the north and west sides of townships;
                                therefore
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That a committee of five be
                                            appointed to investigate the matter, and report on the
                                            same at their earliest convenience.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. GRESHAM. If we go into these various subjects of legislation, we
                                shall be here the forty days. He desired to get through in eight or
                                ten days, and that could not be, if we were going to raise
                                committees, and set them to work in this way.
                            Mr. COLLINS of Adams did not propose legislation - nothing more than
                                a report to settle a question amongst surveyors.
                            The resolution was adopted by consent, and the SPEAKER appointed the
                                committee, viz: Messrs. Collins of Adams, Jones of Wayne, Williams,
                                Grain and Lane.

                            
                                ORDER OF BUSINESS.
                                The SPEAKER announced the order of business for the session as
                                    follows: Presenting petitions, memorials, and resolutions,
                                    several and joint, from 9 till 10 o'clock; Reports from Standing
                                    and Select Committees, from 10 to 11 o'clock; Introduction and
                                    second reading of bills, from 11 o'clock to Recess.
                                Afternoon sessions will be devoted to bills on their passage.
                                On motion by Mr. RAGAN, it was
                                Ordered, That the Principal and Assistant Clerks of this House be
                                    required to appoint three assistants each, and that the
                                    Doorkeeper appoint two pages and one Assistant Doorkeeper.
                                Mr. HEFFREN submitted an order, which was adopted, requiring the
                                    Governor, (if not in his opinion incompatible with the public
                                    interest,) to inform the House of the condition and use of the
                                    public arms.
                            
                            
                                GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE.
                                Mr. PARRETT, from the Committee on the
                                        Distribution of the Governor's Message, reported
                                    that the 5,000 copies in the English language would be ready
                                    Saturday morning, and the 2,000 German copies some time early
                                    next week.
                                On motion by Mr. BUNDY, the House took up the consideration of
                                    the Governor's Message.
                                On motion by Mr. HEFFREN, so much of the Governor's Message as
                                    relates to the matter of raising money for pay and provisions
                                    for the volunteers, was referred to the Committee on
                                        Ways and Means, and so much of the Message as
                                    relates to the military and Military Affairs, was referred to
                                    the committee on that subject.
                                On motion by Mr. BUNDY, all such matter of the Message as relates
                                    to the subject of treason, and the suspension of legal process
                                    against volunteers, was referred to the Committee on
                                        the Judiciary.
                            
                            
                                GOVERNOR'S CONTINGENT FUND.
                                Mr. FISHER introduced a bill [4] making an appropriation to
                                    defray the expense of preparing to respond to the call of the
                                    President of the United States for troops. [It appropriates
                                    $100,000 to the Governor's contingent fund.]
                                The bill was passed to the second reading; and under a suspension
                                    of the rule and constitutional provision, it was read the second
                                    time, and referred to a Select Committee of Five, namely:
                                    Messrs. Fisher, Buridy, Hays, Ford, and Stotsenberg.
                            
                            
                                PAY OF MEMBERS AND OFFICERS.
                                Mr. HEFFREN submitted the following, which was adopted:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, by the House of
                                                Representatives, (the Senate concurring,) that the
                                                Auditor of State be directed to draw his warrant on
                                                the Treasurer of State for the per diem of  members and
                                                officers, and the mileage of members of the General
                                                Assembly for the present session, upon the
                                                certificate of the presiding officer of each House;
                                                and that appropriation for the same be made in the
                                                Legislative appropriation bill.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. OUR submitted an order which was adopted, authorizing the
                                    Doorkeeper to employ some suitable person to carry the
                                    mail-matter hence to the post-office, provided it shall not cost
                                    more than was paid for the same service at the last session.
                            
                            
                                RELIEF OF BANKING INSTITUTIONS.
                                Mr. BINGHAM introduced a bill [5] for the relief of banking
                                    institutions, and providing for changing their place of
                                    business. [A majority of the Directors shall have power to
                                    remove their place of business when in danger of invasion and
                                    destruction by violence.]
                                The bill was passed to the second reading.
                                On motion by Mr. HEFFREN, (under a dispensation for the purpose,)
                                    it was read the second time.
                                Mr. CRAIN said the bill should be guarded so that $20,000 of
                                    their bills presented for payment should not authorize a
                                    removal. The bill was right in purpose.
                                The SPEAKER. It might very seriously affect the rights of
                                    individuals who have taken notes payable at a particular
                                    bank.
                                On the motion of Mr. BUNDY, it was referred to the
                                        Committee on the Judiciary.
                            
                            
                                DEATH OF MR. BOYDSTON.
                                Mr. FRASIER. Mr. Speaker - I take this occasion to announce, in a
                                    more formal manner than has yet been done here, the decease of
                                    my late colleague, the Hon. THOMAS G. BOYDSTON. He died the 16th
                                    day of March last, but a few days after his arrival at home from
                                    the adjournment of the regular session of the General Assembly.
                                    Upon his arrival at home, he was violently attacked with lung
                                    fever, which caused his death the following Sabbath morning. [He
                                    proceeded in a brief eulogy on the character of the deceased,
                                    and was followed by Messrs. Dobbins, Thomas, Parrett, Heffren
                                    and Bundy.]
                                On motion by Mr. MOORMAN, it was ordered that a committee of five
                                    be appointed to report appropriate resolutions; and the SPEAKER
                                    appointed Messrs. Moorman, Frasier, Dobbins, McLean and
                                    Underwood.
                                The House then adjourned till to-morrow morning, 9 o'clock.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            FRIDAY, April 26, 1861.
                        
                        The PRESIDENT announced the following Committee on Trade and
                                Commerce authorized yesterday: Messrs. Jones, Claypool,
                            Hamilton, Wagner, Tarkington, Steele, Line, Anthony and March.
                        Mr. CLAYPOOL, from the Committee on Finance, returned
                            his bill (6) introduced yesterday, with a substitute therefor, embracing
                            the idea of the original bill, recommending passage. The report was
                            concurred in.
                        Mr. CLAYPOOL moved that the bill be considered as engrossed and read the
                            third time now.
                        The motion was agreed to, and the bill read the third time.
                        Mr. RAY feared that this bill was giving little too loose a rein to the
                            counties, which might involve the State in difficulty.
                        Mr. LINE, by consent, amended the bill by inserting in the proper place
                            the words:
                        "And the County Boards and the authorities of incorporated towns and
                            cities are hereby empowered to make such regulations as they may think
                            right and proper in the disbursement of said appropriations."
                        Mr. FERGUSON, by consent, amended the bill by inserting the words: "and
                            for home defense" after the words "Union of the States" in section
                            1.
                        The bill, as amended, was then finally passed the Senate by yeas 45, nays

                            SIX REGIMENTS MORE.
                            Mr. WOLFE, from the Committee on Military Affairs,
                                returned Mr. Tarkington's resolution, introduced yesterday,
                                recommending passage with amendments, making the same a concurrent
                                resolution; striking out the words and figures, "the 49 companies,"
                                and inserting "all the companies, not to exceed regiments:" and
                                after the word "regiments," inserting the following "called for by
                                the President of the United States."
                            On Mr. STEELE'S motion, this report was concurred in, with the
                                following amendment:
                            That the companies accepted by the Adjutant General should date in
                                the new requisition in the order in which they were received by the
                                dispatches of the Adjutant General.
                            Mr. MELLETT moved to fill the blank with "six."
                            Mr. WAGNER proposed "twelve." If we are to have a great war, I say
                                that I will vote all the money of my people, and I will ask
                                volunteers of my constituents, and they will respond in both money
                                and men to protect our citizens on the border. In my county a
                                traitor could no live long enough for the echo of his voice to die
                                before he would be torn in pieces. Whatever the honor of the State
                                or the preservation of the government demand, I am willing to vote,
                                I care not whether it is one million or ten.
                            Mr. MARCH. We must proceed with caution and prudence. Wind and bottom
                                is as necessary in the race of war as in the race of speed. I hope
                                we will all keep cool. Now, sir, if this proposition is to be the
                                final disposition of this whole matter, and it is to commit the
                                State to a final policy, I am not ready to vote for it as it stands
                                but if it is a mere temporary proposition to justify the Governor in
                                what he has done until w can enact a law governing the whole
                                subject, then I am willing to vote for it. I think six regiments is
                                an ample number. Ohio has only six, and the State is much more
                                exposed. * * * If we act prudently, we can not doubt the issue of
                                this contest. I trust we will act soberly - act as though we
                                comprehended the whole field, an were prepared to meet it, whether
                                it be one, two, an hundred or a thousand years.
                            Mr. STEELE. I think if we authorize twelve regiments it would be
                                going farther than we should at this time. Put six in the field;
                                have them properly drilled and ready at a moment's warning, and they
                                will be more efficient than twelve regiments untrained. I say twelve
                                or twenty regiments whenever the exigency requires  them. I am willing to vote every cent
                                I have on earth for the support of this Government rather than let
                                it go down. If we vote six regiments to-day, in four days six more
                                may be needed, and it would be an easy matter for us to vote
                                them.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER. The State of Indiana would not call out a larger
                                number of regiments than she can maintain permanently.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. There is no necessity requiring immediate and final
                                action on this question. I am ready at any time to act in consonance
                                with the duty we owe to the southern portion of our State.
                            After a few remarks by Messrs. Campbell and Steele -
                            Came the recess till 2 o'clock.

                                Hamilton's resolution of yesterday afternoon, stating that he had
                                "been compelled by circumstances to purchase supplies from day to
                                day which has been done, by consultation from time to time with the
                                different State officers, and on such terms as would enable me to
                                obtain good and wholesome provisions at the lowest possible prices,
                                holding in view at the same time the best interests of the

                            On motion of Mr. STUDABAKER it was farther amended by adding these
                                words:
                            All the companies that have already been accepted are enrolled as a

                                accepted, if any additional companies are required they shall, as
                                far as the same may be tendered, be accepted from those counties
                                that have not yet furnished any.
                            The resolution, (now a concurrent resolution,) as thus amended, was
                                then adopted.

                            THE MILITIA.
                            Mr. ORR submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Military Affairs inquire into the
                                            expediency of enacting a law that light in-  fantry and rifle companies

                            RELIEF LAWS.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on the Judiciary be instructed to report a
                                            bill to the House, providing for the relief of the
                                            citizens of our State, either by a temporary suspension
                                            of our Courts, the extension of the time upon
                                            executions, or such other mode of relief as may meet the
                                            present emergency.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            MONEY FOR DEFENCE.
                            Mr. VEATCH, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                returned his bill, [3] To authorize the Boards of Commissioners of
                                the several counties, and the corporate authorities of each of the
                                cities and incorporated towns of this State, to make appropriations
                                for defense against invasion, and unlawful violence, and to
                                authorize the levy of a tax therefor; and to authorize such
                                appropriations already made, with an amendment incorporating a
                                section, viz:
                            SEC. 2. The said Boards of Commissioners, and the corporate
                                authorities of said cities and towns, are hereby authorized to
                                contract debts and borrow money, and to pledge the faith of such
                                counties, cities, or towns for the payment of the same and the
                                interest thereon, by the issuance of bonds, notes or drafts, which
                                shall be duly signed, registered, &c.
                            The amendment was adopted, and so the bill was ordered to be
                                engrossed.
                            Mr. VEATCH moved that the bill be considered and engrossed, and read
                                the third time now.
                            Mr. McLEAN. In our county, the Board of Commissioners, without any
                                law, have made an appropriation of $5,000 for the support of
                                families of volunteers, and it strikes me that there ought to be a
                                provision in this bill to legalize such an act as that already
                                past.
                            Mr. VEATCH. I have another bill for that purpose. The bill under
                                consideration contemplates defense, and for that purpose, authorizes
                                borrowing money. I have a separate bill here for the aid of
                                volunteers and their families.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. It seems to me that this bill ought to be ordered to
                                be published immediately in the city papers, that it may go into
                                effect at once.
                            Mr. MOORMAN objected to the publication clause. He would not place it
                                in the power of any man, by refusing to publish the bill, to prevent
                                its going into effect.
                            Mr. EDSON. I understand the object is to give general information of
                                the provisions of the act; that the Secretary of State shall cause a
                                certified copy of this act to be sent and filed with the clerks of
                                the several counties.
                            Mr. Stotsenberg's amendment was agreed to, and so the bill passed the
                                third and last reading in the House of Representatives - yeas 85,
                                nays 0.
                        
                        
                            FAMILIES OF VOLUNTEERS.
                            Mr. VEATCH, from the Judiciary Committee, returned
                                the petition of sundry citizens of the county of Laporte, for the
                                enactment of a law authorizing county commissioners to make
                                appropriations for the support of the families of volunteers, and
                                thereupon reported a bill (6) to authorize the boards
                                of'commissioners of the several counties of the State of Indiana to
                                make appropriations for raising, equipping and furnishing companies
                                of volunteers, and for the support of the families of volunteers,
                                which was passed to the second reading.
                        
                        
                            "STATE OF THE UNION."
                            Mr. ROBERTS, from the select committee to which was referred his
                                joint resolution (J. R. No. 1) submitted yesterday, reported the
                                same back with amendments, so as to make it read as follows:
                            WHEREAS, Treason, as defined by the Constitution of the United
                                States, prevails to an alarming extent in several of the States of
                                this Union: and
                            WHEREAS, In view of this fact, it has become the duty of the
                                President of the United States to call upon the military power of
                                the country to quell the insurrectionary and rebellious proceedings
                                in the said States,and to enforce the laws and preserve the Union
                                from disruption: Therefore,
                            
                                
                                    
                                        1. Be it resolved by the General Assembly of
                                                the State of Indiana, That to suppress such
                                            insurrection, to enforce the laws of the General
                                            Government, and restore peace and good order to the
                                            country, the entire resources of the State are hereby
                                            tendered.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        2. Resolved, That we call upon all good
                                            citizens, irrespective of party, to rally in solid
                                            phalanx to the rescue of their cosamon country, pledging
                                            their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honors to
                                            redeem it from the danger in in which it has
                                            been placed by the hands of traitors.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        3. Resolved, That in our neighbors of
                                            Kentucky and other [border] States, whose loyalty to the
                                            Union has beep and is unshaken, we have the utmost
                                            confidence, and assure them of our faith in their
                                            patriotism.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        4. Resolved, That the Governor be
                                            requested to transmit a copy of these resolutions
                                            forthwith to the President of the United States and to
                                            the Governors of all the States.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The amendments were concurred in.
                            Mr. CRANE. I wish to amend further by, striking out the word
                                "border," so as to include all the States in our confidence.
                            Mr. FRASIER, If the language has reference to individual citizens of
                                Kentucky, Tennessee, and other States, it is all well enough. But if
                                it has reference to them as States as they are governed at present,
                                my faith in them is not as large as a grain of mustard seed. If it
                                is to give aid to Union then I am for the resolution.
                            Mr. ORR. I am perfectly satisfied with the resolutions, since that
                                word has been stricken out. I look to the people of Western
                                Virginia, and believe they are about taking such a course as will
                                relieve them from the error of the Eastern half of the State.
                            Mr. EDSON proposed to amend further, so as to require a copy of the
                                joint resolution to be sent to the Governors of the several
                                States.
                            The amendment was agreed to by unanimous consent.
                            And so the resolution was adopted - yeas 84, nays 0 - with an
                                amendment of title proposed by Mr. EDSON, viz.: "A joint resolution
                                tendering the aid of the State to the General Government to suppress
                                insurrection."
                        
                        
                            PAY OF THE VOLUNTEER SERVICE.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG, from the select committee thereon, returned Mr.
                                Fisher's bill (4) appropriating $100,000 to the Governor's
                                contingent fund, with an amendment of the first section, in the
                                ninth and tenth lines, striking out and inserting: "Under the recent
                                or any subsequent requisition of the President of the United
                                States."
                            
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I would like to inquire whether it is the
                                Quartermaster's or Commissary's opinion that this service will
                                require that amount of money?
                            Mr. NEBEKER. We shall be obliged to give some discretion here.
                            The amendment was concurred in.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG moved that the bill be now considered as engrossed,
                                and put on its final passage.
                            Mr. PARRETT. It is of the utmost importance that we should act
                                cautiously here. I move that the bill be referred to the
                                    Committee on Military Affairs.
                            The latter motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. GRESHAM asked and obtained leave for the Committee on
                                    Military Affairs to sit during the sessions of the
                                House.
                        
                        
                            CAVALRY - FLYING ARTILLERY.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Before this committee retires I would like to have the
                                sense of the House in regard to the different orders of troops to be
                                brought into service. For this purpose I submit the following
                                resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That it is the sense of this
                                            House that in any bill passed for the organization and
                                            equipment of the militia, the State should make
                                            provision for the organization of one or more regiments
                                            of light horse cavalry, and three or more companies of
                                            flying artillery.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. H. urged the consideration of the resolution with an earnest
                                statement of the necessity to meet cavalry with cavalry, and
                                artillery to meet artillery, and adding that the Governor had
                                expressed himself as desirous that something like this should be
                                provided for.
                            Mr. FRASIER. I have expected to rely almost entirely, in regard to
                                this military machinery, on the judgment of those who have made that
                                subject their study, and who know what is wanted. I do not pretend
                                to know whether it would be. best to raise one regiment of cavalry
                                or six. I expect to wait and be guided by the report we shall get
                                from the Military Committee.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Cavalry companies are to organized the same as infantry,
                                and tendered to the Governor to be under his control and subject to
                                his orders.
                            Mr. FRASIER. I hope the Committee will avail itself of the counsel
                                and advice of the best military men amongst us, and that a discreet
                                bill will be reported. I move to make the resolution, a resolution
                                of inquiry, and directory to the Committee on Military
                                    Affairs.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I wish merely to have an expression of the sense of the
                                House.
                            Mr. CASON. I hope the amendment will not prevail I also desire the
                                sense of the House to be taken on the proposition of the gentleman
                                from Washington and Harrison.
                            Mr. FRASIER withdrew his amendment and motion.
                            Mr. CASON. So far as I am concerned I am prepared to vote for
                                anything to put the State on a military footing. I hope that nothing
                                in relation to expense will be taken into consideration very
                                carefully now; but that the controlling question will be, what is
                                for the best interest of the State?
                            Mr. EDSON proposed to amend by adding: "Said companies to be raised
                                in counties bordering on the Ohio river." He said - I understand the
                                object is the protection of the border counties on the river, and I
                                think it is but fairness and justice that the people of those
                                counties should have the preference. Northern counties are not in
                                danger. I do not doubt the patriotism of the men there, nor in any
                                other part of the State. But as for the southwestern part of the
                                State, all they ask is that you shall place arms in their hands, and
                                they will defend themselves. We do not want foreign troops quartered
                                among us for our protection until a stronger force shall come
                                against us than yet appears. I have this morning information from my
                                county of the formation of companies of cavalry there - one under
                                the command of Capt. Richard Owen, lately our State Geologist.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I do not know any difference between Indianians. If they
                                were exposed on the north, I think it would be my duty to go and
                                help them; and when I go amongst them in that way I shall expect
                                them to feed me. And 1 want the people of the Northern portion of
                                the State to have the privilege now of coming forward and helping
                                us. ["We will."] I want no exclusive privileges here, as far I am
                                concerned. When the flag of our country needs protection, I am glad
                                to know that we are all ready to stand by it or fall in its defense
                                - ready to give our blood and treasure to a common cause, fighting a
                                common foe. I do hope that the amendment of the gentleman from
                                Vanderburgh and Posey will not prevail. We shall have enough to go
                                in protecting ourselves, our families and firesides from the
                                invader, and no one should be excluded from participation in the
                                contest. There should be no favoritism in such a cause. If I cannot
                                hope to be a general, no man can prevent me from standing in the
                                ranks and drawing a sabre as a private. Let us never forget to
                                recognize men coming from the North and the Centre as well as those
                                from the Southern portion of the State. Let us be accepted all
                                alike. Let us know no Sections in Indiana, but as Indianians let us
                                stand together and protect ourselves, if possible, and if not let us
                                do the best we can.
                            Mr. GRESHAM said this discussion was premature. He thought it
                                expedient to protect the border. His people were exposed. They had
                                spilt their blood on the Northern border, and they could not doubt
                                that the North would act as well. He desired no action like this
                                resolution; but that the committee might be allowed to go to work,
                                and the House get along with business.
                            Mr. NEBEKER moved to lay the motion on the table.
                            Mr. EDSON. (By consent.) The reason I made this proposition was
                                because the Governor had not called on the Southern part of the
                                State for troops, and we are yet staying at home.
                            On a division of the question, the amendment only was laid on the
                                table.
                            Mr. ORR. The resolution was introduced to obtain the sense of the
                                House. This is necessary. Any observing man can form an idea of the
                                formidableness of a corps of flying artillery. It is only necessary
                                to call to mind the efficiency of the "little more grape" of Capt.
                                Bragg's artillery in the Mexican war. I wish to God that we  had now twenty well appointed
                                and well-drilled companies of artillery.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG demanded the previous question, and under its
                                operation the resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            DECEASE OF THOMAS G. BOYDSTON.
                            Mr. MOORMAN, from the special committee appointed yesterday for that
                                purpose, reported the following:
                            WHEREAS, It has pleased an all - wise and overruling Providence to
                                remove by death the Hon. Thomas G. Boydston, of Kosciusko county, a
                                member of this body; therefore,
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That in his death we have
                                            lost a tried and faithful member, and the county a good
                                            and true patriot.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That we deeply sympathize
                                            with his afflicted ind disconsolate family in their
                                            distress.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the foregoing
                                            resolutions be spread upon the journals, and that a copy
                                            of the same be transmitted by the Clerk to the family of
                                            the deceased.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the dailies of this city
                                            be requested to insert the above resolutions.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolutions were unanimously adopted.
                            On motion by Mr. STOTSENBURG, Lieut. Grover obtained leave of absence
                                for the service at Camp.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS introduced a bill [7] to authorize the formation of a
                                military force on the border of the State; which was passed to the
                                second reading.
                            On motion of Mr. WILLIAMS, (the rules being suspended for the
                                purpose), it was read the second time. He then moved to refer the
                                bill to'a special committee of Representatives of the counties
                                bordering on the Ohio river.
                            Mr. PARRETT preferred that it should go to the Committee on
                                    Military Affairs, where we had perhaps the best
                                military talent from the border counties.
                            Mr. NEBEKE . This will make part of a system which the Military
                                Committee are perfecting, and the reference of the bill to a select
                                committee would be labor lost.
                            Mr. CRAIN concurred in this view.
                            The bill was referred to the Committee on Military
                                    Affairs.
                        
                        
                            POSTAGE.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Bartholomew, introduced a, bill [8] making an
                                appropriation of $150 to procure postage stamps for the use of
                                members of the General Assembly; which was passed to the second
                                reading, and (under a constitutional dispensation) read the second
                                time and considered.
                            Mr. HEFFREN said the bill would not pay the postage order of the
                                Senate, which was $3 for each officer and member. It did not embrace
                                the officers at all.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Bartholomew, was willing to accept an amendment. The
                                bill was to carry out the order of yesterday for stamps, and they
                                could not be obtained without the money. The bill could be amended
                                either here or in the Senate.
                            Mr. McLEAN proposed to make the appropriation $200.
                            Mr. BUNDY proposed $250.
                            Mr. PARRETT was unwilling to yield to the demands of the Senate, and
                                moved to lay the amendments on the table.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. LANE made an ineffectual motion to lay the bill on the table.
                            The bill was ordered to be engrossed; considered as engrossed and
                                passed the final reading yeas - 57, nays 24.
                            Mr. BLACK introduced a bill [9] to provide for refunding saline funds
                                to persons who have erroneously paid them into the treasury of such
                                fund; which was passed to the second reading.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS introduced a bill [10] to amend Sec. 5 of the act fixing
                                the times of holding the Courts of Common Pleas in the several
                                counties of this State, approved March 5, 1861, which bills were
                                severally passed to second reading.
                        
                        
                            DEFENCE BILL.
                            On motion by Mr. Frasier, the county and town defence bill [S. No. 6]
                                just reported by message, was taken up and passed the first
                                reading.
                            On motion by Mr. CRAIN, (there being a dispensation for the purpose,)
                                it was read the second time and referred to the Committee
                                    on the Judiciary.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The SPEAKER not yet returning -
                            On the motion of Mr. WOODHULL, Mr. Fisher, of Wabash, was continued
                                in the Chair.

                            
                                TREASON AND ITS PUNISHMENT.
                                On the motion of Mr. CRAIN, his treason bill [1] was taken up and
                                    considered on the second reading.
                                Mr. HOLCOMB moved that the bill be laid on the table, and three
                                    hundred copies be printed.
                                Mr. RAGAN thought it should be corrected a little before
                                    printing.
                                Mr. PARRETT preferred that it should be referred to the
                                        Judiciary Committee, as first proposed by
                                    the gentleman from Gibson.
                                Mr. WOODHULL preferred that it should be printed now.
                                Mr. CRAIN said the bill had been drawn with a good deal of care.
                                    It was thought by some that there should be another section
                                    making the expression of certain sentiments a misdemeanor; but
                                    he did not think so. He was advised that some eighteen of the
                                    States of this Union had statutes similar to this. The matter in
                                    the bill, he thought, could not be objectionable as far as goes.
                                    It might be necessary to add a section.
                                Mr. HEFFREN could see no necessity for this bill. He had heard of
                                    nothing transpiring to demand it in any section of the State. It
                                    used to be well enough understood what was treason - the overt
                                    act of war, and giving aid and comfort to the enemy. War could
                                    not be waged against the State of Indiana without waging war
                                    against the United States; and treason was sufficiently defined
                                    in the laws of the United States. He was for the reference.
                                Mr. RAGAN. Our statutes were deficient in the definition of
                                    treason. We want something more than a mere constitutional
                                    provision. We want a statute based on the Court decisions and
                                    the Constitution. We want it specifically defined what is giving
                                    aid and comfort to the enemy. He hoped the bill would first have
                                    the benefit of the legal reading and ability of the
                                        Committee on the Judiciary.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG demanded the previous question, and under its
                                    force the motion to print was rejected.
                            
                        
                    
                

                
                

                    BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS,

                        Vol. V.
                        INDIANAPOLIS, APRIL 30, 1861.
                        NO. 2.
                    
                    
                        On motion of Mr. HEFFREN the bill was then referred to the
                                Committee on the Judiciary.
                        
                            JUDGES COMPENSATION
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG introduced a bill (11) entitled an act to provide
                                compensation for judges performing official duties for other judges;
                                which was passed to the second reading.
                            Mr. SMITH of Bartholomew submitted the following, which, was
                                adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Auditor of State be
                                            requested to requested to report to this House what
                                            appropriations are necessary to pay the salaries of
                                            judges holding adjourned terms.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. HORTON submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That those members who are
                                            opposed to appropriations for postage stamps be governed
                                            aloud by their conscientious scruples about accepting
                                            them.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            BUSINESS OF THE SESSION.
                            Mr. EDSON submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That it is the sense of this
                                            House that no business be transacted during the present
                                            session except that upon matters which it has been
                                            called and matters properly connected therewith, as
                                            stated in the Governor's message.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. HEFFREN desired to say merely, that only about fifty or sixty of
                                the four hundred convicts in the Southern Prison were now hired out
                                to work. He thought the Legislature should take some action in
                                regard to that labor. Did gentlemen want to see the convicts turned
                                loose again all over the country? then let that resolution be
                                adopted. The Superintendent of Public Instruction was now engaged in
                                preparing the late school law for publication. He had found fatal
                                errors in the enrollment, and was correcting them making it really
                                as it passed here - and that ought to be looked at during the
                                present session. Some of the Judges in the Southern part of the
                                State could not hold court on account of the public excitement. One
                                Judge had adjourned his court in obedience to the call of a public
                                meeting; and this also should admonish us of our duty here. He did
                                not wish to be understood as in favor of going into general
                                legislation now. He desired to consider beyond the recommendations
                                of the Governor only such measures as are absolutely essential to
                                the best interests of the people.
                            Mr. EDSON. I think my resolution embraces that all matters relative
                                to or properly connected with the disturbed state of the country.
                                Its passage would not pervert needful legislation. Of course the
                                first thing was to attend to the business upon which we have been
                                called together. But if, after that, gentlemen shall consent to go
                                on for the forty days, then he had some business to prepare, and
                                would be ready to go on with it; otherwise he would be content. He
                                wanted, however, an expression of the mind of the House as to which
                                course should be adopted.
                            Mr. NEBEKER. If we go into general legislation upon what the State
                                imperatively demands, and every member is to judge of that, then we
                                shall be here for the constitutional limit of forty days. He was
                                willing to correct clerical errors, as suggested by the gentleman
                                from Washington and Harrison, but not to stay here for general
                                legislation and leave the fields unplowed. He gave notice of his
                                intention to vote against every bill not demanded by the national
                                crisis. He was opposed to the bill introduced by the gentlemen from
                                Floyd for this reason alone.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG showed that the defeat of his bill would be to defeat
                                the ends of justice. The worthy Judge in his circuit was now called
                                to hold court in three places, and must be paid for his service, or
                                it could not be rendered.
                            Mr. HEFFREN proposed to amend the resolution by substituting the
                                following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That it is the sense of this
                                            House that no legislation be entered into at the present
                                            session, except such as will be necessary to protect the
                                            persons and property of citizens of the State of
                                            Indiana, her rights and her territory, and to support
                                            the General Government in sustaining its authority, and
                                            such as may be necessary to correct errors in the
                                            enrollment of bills passed at the last session of the
                                            General Assembly.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. GRAIN desired expression on this question. But if it was
                                understood that we go on and introduce all sorts of bills, we shall
                                be here forty days, and in confusion at last. We should do nothing
                                here but what is demanded by the crisis, then go home and cultivate
                                the fields.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Bartholomew, thought the first resolution the best. It
                                gave more latitude for needful legislation, and he preferred it on
                                that account. He should vote against the substitute. - On the motion
                                of Mr. ORR, the matter was referred to the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary.
                            Mr. DOBBINS submitted a resolution directing the Committee
                                    on Military Affairs to inquire and report as to how
                                many companies will be necessary to protect the State of Indiana
                                from invasion; 2d, the amount and description of arms to be procured
                                ; and 3d, the probable cost.
                        
                        
                            ABSENCE.
                            Mr. HEFFREN asked, and obtained leave of absence, from to-morrow
                                morning till Monday night.
                            Mr. BINGHAM asked, and obtained leave of absence for Mr. Stotsenberg,
                                on account of .sickness in his family. 
                            
                            Mr. KNOWLTON submitted the following;
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That his Excellency, the
                                            Governor, be requested to inform the House whether it is
                                            advisable to raise and equip twelve regiments of troops
                                            for the protection of our State.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. KNOWLTON. I see a bill on my table for this purpose, but I do not
                                see any such recommendation in the Governor's message. If they were
                                needed, I would be willing to vote for raising twice twelve
                                regiments. But are they needed? A great many here are in doubt, and
                                I think it would be well to have the mind of the Governor whether
                                this is advisable.
                            Mr. BUNDY. The Governor is not probably in possession of any more
                                information upon this question than any member of this House. I can
                                not vote for this resolution, because I think it useless.
                            Mr. PACKARD. I would like to know whether the remark of the gentleman
                                from Henry is not applicable as well to every sentiment in the
                                Governor's message as to the matter of the resolution.
                            Mr. FRASIER. My impression of the matter is, that at this time we can
                                tell but little about it. If no more alarming events transpire than
                                we have already seen. I shall not very soon be prepared to vote for
                                raising those twelve regiments of troops, to cost the State some
                                $17,000 to $20,000 a day. When gentlemen come to figure on this
                                thing a little while it looks different from what it appears on the
                                first blush. When I first came down I had not figured up this thing
                                at all; but when I came to get the estimate that it would cost $1 25
                                a day per man, I began a rough calculation, which presently showed
                                that twelve regiments would cost us at least three millions a year.
                                This is a pretty large pile for the State to shoulder. I do not
                                doubt the feeling of the people of the State, that they would be all
                                right if it became necessary to pile up dollars and cents and weigh
                                them against the blood of our citizens, the perpetuity of our
                                institutions, or the honor of our flag. I say I can have no doubt as
                                to what their decision would be in such a case. I have no doubt that
                                they would say that our institutions and our flag must be sustained
                                at every cost. But, Mr. Speaker, we do not yet know what is upon us.
                                I trust that these troubles will subside. I confess that the
                                appearance is forelorn, and it may cost us a war of years to crush
                                out this rebellion. The best we can do is to save as much of our
                                means as possible, and give assurance to the world that we are in
                                earnest. We have already raised six regiments in ten days, at a time
                                when we were without anything deserving the name of a military
                                organization. When we remember this it seems to me that we may by
                                assured that but a very few days will be necessary to bring to
                                Indianapolis almost any number of men that may be all any time
                                required of us.
                            Mr. KNOWLTON considered that as the Governor was now surrounded by
                                military men, he might be well advised of this matter; and, although
                                he was opposed to the bill raising these regiments, still he wanted
                                and would be guided by good counsels.
                            Mr STOTSENBERG demanded the previous question, and under its
                                operation the resolution was adopted.
                            The House then adjourned.
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            SATURDAY, April 27, 1861.
                        
                        Mr. NEWCOMB introduced a bill [8]
                            providing for the appointment of deputies by certain public officers of
                            this State who have or may hereafter enter the military service of the
                            United States or of this State, and authorizing such deputies to perform
                            all the duties of their principals; which wad read the first time.
                        On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB the rules were suspended, the bill read the
                            second time and referred to the judiciary
                            committee.
                        Mr. STUDABAKER introduced a bill [9] to in possession of any more
                            information upon this provide for the purchase of arms and implements of
                            war for the use of the militia and volunteer military companies of the
                            State of Indiana; which I was read the first time.
                        On motion of Mr. STUDABAKER the rules were suspended and the bill read
                            the second time.
                        Mr. CLAYPOOL moved to amend by insert ing "15,000M instead of "5,000"
                            stand of arms, and to further amend by providing for the purchase of
                            arms and accoutrements sufficient to equip four regiments of cavalry,
                            and to further amend by providing, for the purchase of guns and
                            accoutrements sufficient to put into the field two battalions of flying
                            artillery. It is the experience of military men that regiments of
                            volunteers ought to be accompanied by flying artillery, and we have
                            within our borders several well organized corps of artillery men.
                        On motion by Mr. MELLETT the bill and amendments were referred to the
                                Committee on Finance.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB offered the following joint resolution [S. No. 2]:
                        A joint resolution relative to the passage of laws inter fering with the
                            collection of debts, in the Courts of this State.
                        WHEREAS apprehensions are entertained by some of the citizens of this
                            State that this General Assembly will enact laws to suspend or delay the
                            collection of debts in the Courts of this State; therefore, to quiet all
                            agitation on that subject,
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Be it Resolved by the General Assembly of the
                                            State of Indiana:
                                    
                                    Sec. 1. That no law ought to be passed to interfere, with the
                                        collection of existing debts, under the laws in force at the
                                        date of the contracting of such debts, because under the
                                        decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States and of
                                        the State of Indiana this General Assembly has no
                                        constitutional power to enact such a law:
                                    And because such enactment would be a public declaration of
                                        bankruptcy on the part, of the people of Indiana, which
                                        would not be true in fact and would prostrate the credit of
                                        the State and of the citizens at a period when the public
                                        safety requires the preservation of the public credit and of
                                        the credit of the citizens of the State.
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    2. And be it further resolved, That it is
                                        inexpedient to enact any law postponing the collection of
                                        debts hereafter contracted, because parties contracting can
                                        make their own terms as to times of payment.
                                
                            
                        
                        3. This General Assembly does not intend by these resolutions to express
                            an opinion against granting any relief it can under the Constitution to
                            those who have entered into the military service of the State or of the
                            United States.
                        On motion by Mr. WAGNER it was referred to the Judiciary
                                Committee.

                        
                            NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                            The following bills were introduced and severally passed the first
                                reading:
                            By Mr. FERGUSON: [S. 10] To
                                authorize incorporated cities and towns to execute bonds for the
                                safety and delivery, upon the demand of the  government of the State of Indiana, of
                                any and all arms distributed to such cities and towns for the use of
                                the military organizations in such cities and towns, and providing
                                when the same may take effect.
                            By Mr. MARCH: [11] To amend the 18th section of an act entitled an
                                act to fix the times Of holding the Common Pleas Courts in the
                                several counties of this State, the duration of the terms, and
                                making all process from the present Common Pleas Courts returnable
                                to such terms, and declaring when this act shall take effect, and
                                repealing all laws inconsistent therewith.
                            By Mr. STONE: [12] To legalize the acts of the Auditor of State in
                                depositing certain bonds of the State in the Branch at Indianapolis
                                of the Bank of the State of Indiana, as security for $25,000
                                borrowed by the Governor, Secretary, Auditor and Treasurer of State,

                                by the State.

                            On motion of Mr. FERGUSON, the rules were suspended - yeas 39, nays
                                0and the Senate bills numbered 10, 12, 13 and 14, introduced this morning, were
                                severally read the second time by title only, and referred to
                                appropriate committees.
                            On motion of Mr. BEESON - yeas 22, nays 16Mr. March's bill was laid
                                on the table.
                        
                        
                            RATIONS FOR VOLUNTEERS.
                            Mr. HAMILTON offered the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, by the Senate, That the
                                            reply of the Commissary General to the resolution of the
                                            Senate of the 26th inst. is unsatisfactory; that he be
                                            requested to answer more specifically, and particularly
                                            what he pays per day for each ration furnished at Camp
                                            Morton, in what does the ration consist and who is the
                                            contractor.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. HAMILTON said that he had some considerable experience in this
                                kind of contracts. A party ought to be bound to certify to, the
                                correctness of his accounts. In the commencement of our troubles he
                                wanted a strict accountability.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. We ought to know from the Commissary General what
                                amount of bacon, flour, &c., has been purchased, and what
                                donations have been received by him, and furnished to the soldiers.
                                I have seen, when passing along the streets, barrels and baskets of
                                provisions from various portions of the State en
                                    route for Camp Morton, and we ought to know what these
                                donations amount to.
                            Mr. BLAIR moved to amend the resolution by adding these words:
                            And the price paid or charged the State for the provisions purchased
                                or furnished, and the quantity of the same, and the persons from
                                whom purchased, and what articles of food have been donated and by
                                whom, for the troops in, Camp Morton and other places in or near
                                this city.
                            Mr. STEELE. I think a resolution of this kind ought to be adopted.
                                There has been great complaints of a reckless extravagance as to
                                expense; and as one of the tax payers of Indiana, I want to get
                                along upon as economical a scale as possible; therefore I think it
                                necessary to look into these things with the strictest scrutiny. It
                                is said that a single government contractor in the troubles with
                                Utah made a clear profit of more than the whole cost of maintaining
                                the army.
                            Mr. JOHNSON. We ought to know the amount distributed to each soldier
                                per day. I move to amend by requiring to be reported the amount of
                                each ration.
                            On motion by Mr. WAGNER, the resolution and amendments were referred
                                to a select committee, consisting of Messrs. Steele, Studabaker and
                                Claypool.
                        
                        
                            THE LATE HON. RICHARD ROBBINS.
                            On motion by Mr. LINE -
                            The PRESIDENT appointed Messrs. Line, Beeson and Berry a committee
                                "to prepare and present to the Senate by next Monday, 3 o'clock P.
                                M., suitable resolutions relative to the death of the Hon. Richard
                                Robbins, a member of this body, from the county of Decatur."
                            On motion by Mr. DeHART, it was -
                            The defence bill [H. R. 12] was read first and second time under a
                                suspension of the rules, and referred to the Committee on
                                    Finance.
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the officers of the
                                            companies in Camp Morton, who may visit the capital, be
                                            invited to take seats within the bar of the Senate.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The joint resolution from the House of Representatives, authorizing
                                the Auditor of State to issue warrants upon the State Treasury for
                                the mileage and per diem of members and officers of the General
                                Assembly was taken up and concurred in.
                            Mr. CONNER offered the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That when the Senate
                                            adjourns; it shall adjourn; to meet on Monday next, at 2
                                            o'clock P. M.
                                    
                                
                            
                            On motion by Mr. WAGNER, it was laid on the table - yeas 22, nays
                                17.
                            Then came the recess till 2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The joint resolution [H. R. No. 2] authorizing the sending of arms to
                                certain counties was taken up and read.
                            Mr. WOLFE. In view of the uncertainty in which we are involved we
                                must act, and act without counting the cost. Whatever we do we must
                                do it as cheaply and as economically as we can, but I would just as
                                willingly vote for twenty thousand as for one thousand whenever the
                                necessity is presented to me. * * * There should be arms enough left
                                in each county in the State to arm at least one independent company,
                                so that when called upon they can march at almost a moment's
                                warning. This I take to be the prime object of the meeting of this
                                Legislature, to put the State in a position that she may protect
                                herself against any incursionists that may come against her. This
                                may cost one or five millions, but whatever it costs I desire to
                                expend it economically. If it is demanded, appropriate ten millions,
                                but if it is not demanded do not appropriate one dollar. This
                                resolution ought certainly to pass and the only objection I have to
                                it  is that if only says
                                thousand, instead of thousand.
                            Mr. MURRAY proposed to amend by adding: "provided said arms shall not
                                be delivered to any but regular organized military companies under
                                the laws'of this State."
                            Mr. LINE proposed a further Amendment including other counties on
                                certain conditions.
                            Mr. COBB. This resolution is an evidence of the avidity with which we
                                jump at things here. The resolution is general in its terms for
                                distributing arms, but without any rules by which they are to be
                                brought back. Now it ought to be guarded in some way so as to secure
                                these arms in the future. The resolution should not pass as it is. I
                                move that the resolution and pending amendments be referred to the
                                    Committee on Military Affairs.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            The bill [H. R. 3.]. authorizing the authorities of counties, cities
                                and towns to levy taxes, to borrow money for defense, &c., was
                                passed to the second reading.
                            The joint resolution (H. R. 1,) printed in the House proceedings of
                                yesterday was taken up and read.
                            Mr. WOLFE. I think it is important that this Legislature should pass,
                                in connection with the resolutions already read, a resolution
                                declaring what is the intention and the object of the State of
                                Indiana in regard to the question, which is the controlling subject,
                                of controversy. I refer to the slavery question, I shall offer an
                                amendment that, while what is in the resolutions is true, yet it is
                                the deliberate sentiment of the people of Indiana that it is
                                contrary to the policy of the government and to the people of the
                                North to make any aggressive warfare upon the institution of
                                slavery. I have not prepared my amendment, but will do so.
                            On motion, the resolution was passed over informally.
                            On motion by Mr. WOLFE, it was
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved by the Senate, the House of
                                                Representatives concurring, That the Government
                                            of the United States be and is hereby requested to
                                            furnish the State of Indiana with twenty thousand stand
                                            of first class arms immediately; and that the Governor
                                            is hereby directed to communicate this request to the
                                            proper authorities at Washington by telegraph without
                                            delay, and when the answer is received to communicate
                                            the same to the Legislature.
                                    
                                
                            
                            And then the Senate adjourned till Monday morning 9 o'clock.
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            SATURDAY, April 27, 1861.
                        
                        The CLERK took the chair at 9 o'clock. He announced the continued
                            indisposition of the Speaker, and that the first thing in order will be
                            the election of a Speaker pro tem.
                        On the motion of Mr. ORR, Mr. Fisher was again chosen.
                        On motion by Mr. HORTON the reading of the journal was dispensed
                            with.
                        Mr. ORR submitted the following, which was adopted:
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            the Judiciary inquire into the expediency of
                                        setting forth clearly and explicitly what treason is against
                                        the State and against the General Government, and report to
                                        this House.
                                
                            
                        

                        
                            DEFENSE OF THE STATE.
                            On motion by Mr. VEATCH it was -
                            Ordered, That a special committee of three be
                                appointed to draft a bill which shall provide immediately for the
                                defense of the State.
                            The SPEAKER pro tem, appointed under the order

                                            Resolved, &c. That the Governor be

                                            Warrick, Vanderburg and Posey.
                                    
                                
                            
                            After debate - it was passed by a unanimous vote.

                                thereof.
                            Mr. VEATCH, from the select committee this day appointed thereon, now
                                reported a bill (12) providing that, for the purpose of putting the
                                State in a condition of defense, supporting Government and
                                maintaining the laws of the land the Governor is hereby authorized
                                to procure immediately a supply of first class arms, (sufficient for
                                arming 20,000 men,) consisting of artiller, cavalry and infantry
                                equipments and munition of war; and that an agent or agents be sent
                                in mediately to procure the same. That the sum o $500,000 be
                                appropriated for this purpose, and that the Governor be authorized
                                to borrow that amount of money and pledge the faith of the Stat for
                                the payment therefor to go into immediate effect under the emergency
                                announced.
                            The bill was passed to the first reading, and (under a dispensation)
                                it was considered on the second reading.
                            Mr. FRASIER proposed to amend by making the amount of the
                                appropriation $600,000.
                            After debate -
                            The amendments were agreed to, and the bill as amended, ordered to be
                                engrossed. It wa then considered as engrossed and passed the final
                                reading in the House - yeas 83, nays 0 - Mr, Packard voting in the
                                affirmative, but protesting that $500,000 was enough.
                            On motion by Mr. EDSON, the title was amended so as to read: "An act
                                to provide for the defense of the State of Indiana to procure
                                first-class arms of artillery, calvary and infantry equipments;
                                making the necessary appropriation therefor, and authorizing the
                                Governor to borrow money;" and it was
                            Ordered, That this be the title of said bill.
                        
                        
                            SIX REGIMENTS MORE.
                            On motion by Mr. CRANE the Tarkington six regiment joint resolution,
                                reported yesterday from the Senate, was taken up, and he move that
                                the House concur. He said this resolution was for the purpose of
                                organizing, the troops ready here. These troops had come here with
                                the understanding that they were to be included in the requisition
                                of the General Government. They were now here and much dissatistied.
                                They were just as much on the State, as to their expenses, as though
                                they were accepted and organized. It was right and proper that we
                                should do what we can to satisfy them.
                            Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker: I cannot entirely consent to what is set
                                forth in that resolution. We, upon the military
                                    committee, met last evening, and had under
                                consideration this very question, and according to the
                                recommendation  of military
                                gentlemen advising with us, this resolution was not endorsed. These
                                gentlemen proposed that some provision should be made whereby these
                                companies may be returned to their own counties, and drilled there;
                                that their names should be continued on the rolls, and that they
                                should be first mustered into service upon the next requisition kept
                                in the meantime perhaps on half pay. This course might not give
                                entire satisfaction, but he was satisfied it was the best. It would
                                give the troops experience, and wear off the childs-play of military
                                service, and it would give assurance of a prompt mustering for the
                                next requisition.
                            Mr. FRASIER thought this action had been deferred too long. It was
                                not proposed to take the troops out of the control of the General
                                Assembly, but to dispose of them so they shall not be laying round
                                loose. He also had talked with military men, and they had urged him
                                to have these men disposed of. He had been urged by some to vote for
                                raising ten regiments. He knew also that the Governor had dispatched
                                a messenger to Washington, and it was not at all improbable that in
                                the next six days we shall get news of the acceptance of these six
                                regiments proposed in the resolution. Suppose we do? What harm to
                                have them organized into regiments?
                            Mr. EDSON had also attended the meeting of the Military
                                    Committee and military men last night, and he advised
                                the House to wait for their report, and the benefit of the advice of
                                those military men, who had been invited to advise with them.
                            The joint resolution was referred to the Committee on
                                    Military Affairs.
                        
                        
                            THE SOUTHERN PENITENTIARY.
                            The SPEAKER pro tem. laid before the House a
                                communication from the Directors and Warden of the Penitentiary at
                                Jeffersonville. They state that they have now 90 convicts working
                                under contract at 40 cents a day, and a contract for working 40
                                more, which may not be carried out. The remainder of the 400
                                convicts being unprovided with employment, the Directors ask for an
                                additional appropriation of $20,000 to procure materials and tools,
                                and set them at work on account of the State and $10,000 for
                                contingencies.
                            On motion of Mr. McLEAN, it was referred to the Committee on
                                    the Penitentiary.
                            Mr. CAMERON submitted the following concurrent resolution, which was
                                also referred to Committee on the
                                Penitentiary:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, &c., That the Directors
                                            of the Southern Prison, with the consent of the
                                            Governor, shall have the power to remove the convicts in
                                            the Southern Prison to the Northern Prison, at any time
                                            when in their judgment the Southern Prison is in danger
                                            of being thrown open by a mob, or a force of armed men
                                            from any other State.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            PERSONAL EXPLANATION.
                            Mr. SMITH of Bartholomew. Mr. Speaker: I claim to be one of those
                                humble individuals who think and act for themselves. I am not
                                controlled by the excitement of the hour. I am not swayed by the
                                popular current, or blinded by prejudice. I have not been prompted
                                to say what I may say on this occasion from the impulse of the
                                moment, nor will I speak simply for the purpose of pleasing any one.
                                But, sir, what I shall say at this time will be said after calm and
                                deliberate consideration, prompted by an honest heart and under
                                peculiar circumstances - circumstances such as will cause those upon
                                this floor to make proper allowances for any thing I may say that
                                may not fully accord with their sentiments. I am peculiarly situated
                                laboring under circumstances perhaps more embarrassing than any
                                member upon this floor. Nearly all the relations I have on earth are
                                in the Southern States. In the soil of that proud and gallant State,
                                Old Kentucky, lie bleaching the bones of a dear father and mother, a
                                brother and a sister - yea even nearer than that, sir there, sir,
                                lie mouldering in the clay the bones of those dear little ones who
                                are bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. Then how can I dissipate
                                from my mind the dread idea of going to war with that people. Then
                                where is the heart so hard and callous as not to sympatize with me
                                and give me credit for hoping that the last means may be resorted
                                to, to avert the dread calamities of civil war with all its
                                consequent horrors. I would be less than human if I were not willing
                                to meet those brethren in a spirit of compromise and conciliation.
                                There stand those proud spirits in Kentucky - a Prentice and a
                                Harney - who issued their admonitions, warning the hotspurs, of the
                                South, and the fanatics of the North, of the danger of the present
                                existing state of things, and pleading for peace. There stand those
                                sages and patriots, Grittenden and Guthrie, Dixon and Brown, and a
                                host of others pleading for the preservation of peace and the
                                    maintenance of the Union of those Border States.
                                Then, sir, I say as a loyal citizen to the State of Indiana, as a
                                patriot and statesman, I should exhaust every peaceful means to
                                remain as friends with those border States, Our hitherto social
                                relations; our commerce; our interest in every sense forbid if
                                possible a separation and the shedding of fraternal blood. Yet, sir,
                                while I say this, I say the nag of my country has been assailed and
                                attempted to he stricken down by the unwarranted hand of the
                                usurper; and as a loyal citizen of the adopted State of my choice, I
                                feel in honor bound to defend that flag, which has been regarded as
                                the emblem of a free people. Under that flag we have lived in peace
                                and happiness and prosperity, until we have grown to be the greatest
                                nation on earth, honored and respected as it has been by every
                                nation and wherever its folds have been unfurled and thrown to the
                                breeze. It must be in the future as in the past respected, and to
                                this end it becomes the duty of every Union-loving citizen, whether
                                he tread Southern or Northern soil, to maintain its supremacy with
                                their lives and their fortunes; for once struck down and we may say
                                farewell to that freedom of which we have hitherto so justly and so
                                proudly boasted. It would be a sad day to me to have to take up arms
                                to imbrue my hands in the blood of Americans North or South; and
                                especially against Kentuckians; and never would I do it without she
                                invaded the soil of Indiana, towards whom she should have a maternal
                                feeling. But should that dread hour ever come, which I trust the
                                Supreme Being who rules the destinies of nations may avert; then
                                will I have but one alternative left, to defend the rights and  maintain the honor of the State
                                of my adoption; and this I will do until that Old flag with its
                                stars and stripes unsullied shall wave triumphantly over a free
                                people, or become my winding sheet. To the people of Indiana and
                                Bartholomew county do I owe all that I have and am politically. I
                                feel bound to them by the ties of social relations. I love them with
                                a feeling of affection that I have for no other people; their fate
                                shall be my fate; their destiny shall be mine. I can say truthfully,
                                without fear of successful contradiction, that while acting in the
                                humble capacity of their Representative, that I have endeavored to
                                do that which would reflect their will and was calculated to promote
                                their best interest. And I will not at this late day pursue such a
                                course as to betray that confidence they have reposed in me by their
                                manifestations on so many occasions.
                            Mr. RAGAN said he knew how to appreciate the feeling that had
                                prompted the patriotic sentiments of the gentleman from Bartholomew.
                                He also was a Kentuckian, and had relations there. His fathers and
                                grandfathers on both sides were laid there, and he had brothers and
                                sisters buried there. He could claim to be a Kentuckian as much as
                                any body, and he claimed the protection of the American flag upon
                                the soil of Kentucky. He respected loyal citizens everywhere, and
                                would do nothing to take away the rights of the People of the South.
                                But when the die is cast; when the issue is made up; when the flag
                                of our country is assailed that flag, Mr. Speaker, which protects
                                your interests and mine, and even the interests of its unreasoning
                                assailants themselves the man that assails that flag, if he is my
                                own brother, he forfeits my respect, he forfeits my affection, he
                                becomes a traitor. But I hope to God the people of my native State
                                will never take that position - that they will pause when they shall
                                see the moral grandeur of the position of the men of the North
                                rising up as one man to support the Constitution and rebuke this
                                rebellion. But if they do not, they must take the consequences. It
                                is painful to think of fighting against my brother, but there is no
                                other alternative if they persist. They or we must go to the wall.
                                The issue is liberty, or subserviency to an aristocracy that can not
                                be endured in this country. * * * With him, it was the choice
                                between liberty and slavery between the protection of the Government
                                of the United States, and all the uncertainties and intangibilities
                                of a military despotism.
                            Messrs Williams, Mutz, Prosser and Combs had leave of absence till
                                Monday.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            Mr. JONES, of Vermillion, introduced a bill [13] entitled an act to
                                authorize the Directors of the Indiana State Prison at
                                Jeffersonville, to purchase tools and materials for the employment
                                of the convicts, &c. [It appropriates $25,000 for tools and
                                material, and $10,000 for contingents.] It was passed to the second
                                reading.
                            On motion by Mr. BLACK, his Saline fund bill [9] was taken up,
                                considered on the second reading, and referred to the
                                    Committee on County and Township
                                Business.
                            Mr. VEATCH introduced a bill [14] supplemental to an act entitled an
                                act to provide for a general system of common schools, the officers
                                - thereof, and their respective powers and duties, and matters
                                properly connected therewith, and for the establishment and
                                regulation of township libraries, approved March, 1861.
                            Mr. V. said he had received this bill from the Trustees of
                                Evansville. The school bill of last session made no provision for
                                the cases of failure to elect trustees. We ask that amendment.
                            Mr. Frasier's Supreme Court Clerk bill [2] (which he explained as
                                changing the law so as to live power to the Supreme Court to allow
                                their Clerk, in addition to his allowance for the books of record, a
                                reasonable allowance for extra service,) corning up on the second
                                reading -
                            Mr. NEBEKER feared this "reasonable allowance" might mean $1,900 or
                                $2,000 a year, as in some other cases he cited, and on his motion it
                                was referred to the Committee on the Organization of Courts
                                    of Justice.
                            Mr. Veatch's volunteer relief bill [6] was referred to the
                                    Committee on County and Township Business.
                                Mr. William's Common Pleas bill [10] was referred to the
                                    Committee on the Organization of Courts.
                            Mr. Stotsenberg's Judge compensation bill [11], on motion of Mr.
                                Smith, of Bartholomew, was referred to a special committee viz:
                                Messrs. Smith, of Bartholomew, Frasier, Grain, Edson and
                                Woodhull.
                            Mr. DAVIS submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on the State Prison inquire into the
                                            expediency of making arrangements for the manufacture of
                                            firearms for the State by the unemployed convicts of the
                                            State Prison.
                                    
                                
                            

                            
                                NATIONAL CONCILIATION.
                                Mr. ROBBINS submitted the following:
                                WHEREAS, Our beloved country, with all its grandeur, its
                                    greatness, power and respect, amongst the nations of the
                                    civilized world, with all its political and religious liberty
                                    and freedom, with all its cherished free institutions, are all
                                    this day threatened and shaken to their foundations by civil
                                    discord, strife, hatred, yea, and even actual war amongst the
                                    people of the different sections of our once united, happy,
                                    prosperous and peaceful nation.
                                WHEREAS, We believe we express the earnest wish, sincere desire,
                                    and the real sentiments of a very large majority of the good,
                                    loyal and Union-loving citizens of Indiana in saying, we believe
                                    it to be our duty as the representatives of the people of a
                                    great, loyal, conservative and peace-loving State of the Union
                                    State that, greatly deprecates civil war and its ten thousand
                                    concommitent evils, to continue to make still further efforts
                                    consistant with justice and honor to ourselves, with patriotism
                                    and fidelity towards the Federal Government, and with proper
                                    Christian and fraternal forbearance towards the other States of
                                    the General Government, to peaceably and amicably adjust the
                                    threatening difficulties which overhang and environ our beloved
                                    though distracted country, which at this moment threaten its
                                    very existence; therefore,
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            
                                                Be it resolved by the General Assembly
                                                  of the State of Indiana:
                                            
                                            That we do most heartily coincide with and approve
                                                the recommendation of the Governor of our sister
                                                State, Kentucky, in the wish expressed by him to the
                                                Governor of the State of Ohio, that the Governors of
                                                all the Border States, both free and slave, should
                                                assemble in convention as soon as practicable for
                                                the purpose of acting in the capacity of
                                                conciliators and pacificators of the dufficulties
                                                which exist amongst the various sections of our
                                                common country which so terribly threaten our peace,
                                                our safety, yea, and even our very existence as a
                                                nation.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. FRASIER moved to refer it to the Committee of
                                        Eleven.
                                Mr. ROBBINS urged the adoption of this joint resolution. He
                                    looked upon civil war as one of  the greatest calamities that can
                                    befall any people. Certainly in this country it must be direful
                                    and calamitous in the extreme. He would make any sacrifice
                                    consistent with honor to avoid it. He had hoped this resolution
                                    or a similar one would pass without a dissenting voice. Could it
                                    be that the gentleman from Kosciusko desired this peace
                                    proposition to go into the hands of a committee, where it might
                                    sleep till we go home? For himself, he expected to see a
                                    disposition amongst all conservative men to reconcile all these
                                    national difficulties without resorting to arms.
                                Mr. CASON. I hope the resolution will be referred in accordance
                                    with the motion of the gentleman from Kosciusko. I hope
                                    gentlemen will consider its tendencies before they allow a
                                    resolution of this kind to be discussed, so that we may not
                                    arouse those feelings here which we have hitherto avoided and
                                    suppressed. I tell the gentleman from Fulton, that his
                                    resolution can not be discussed here without arousing ill
                                    feeling, and for this reason: the resolution proposes to accept
                                    as one of the arbiters of these difficulties a man who is one of
                                    the most diabolical traitors in all the Government, &c.
                                Mr. SMITH of Bartholomew hoped the press would not report the
                                    gentleman from Boone's reference to the Governor of Kentucky
                                Mr. CAMERON demanded the previous question, and under its
                                    operation the joint resolution was referred to the special
                                    committee of one from each Congressional District.
                            
                            
                                ARMING THE STATE.
                                On motion by Mr. VEATCH, the concurrent resolution just reported
                                    from the Senate, requesting the Government of the United States
                                    to furnish this State with twenty thousand stand of first class
                                    fire-arms, was taken up.
                                Mr. FRAZIER could not concur. Was it not known that our Governor
                                    had just been to Washington? It was strange that Senators were
                                    willing to wait for information from this source, when they knew
                                    the Governor's demand could not be sent by telegraph; and if it
                                    could be sent, it was known that the answer would be adverse. If
                                    they were going to arm the State, let them say so, &c.
                                Mr. EDSON also spoke generally against the resolution, till,
                                On the motion of Mr. VEATCH, it was laid on the table.
                            
                            
                                CHAPLAINS FOR THE VOLUNTEER SERVICE.
                                Mr. CAMERON submitted the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            
                                                Resolved, That the Governor be
                                                authorized to appoint a Chaplain to each regiment
                                                called into the service either of the General
                                                Government, or the State Government, who shall have
                                                the rank of Captain.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Our people, he said, go into this war as a holy war - a war for
                                    the protection of our country and its institutions, of our homes
                                    and fire-sides. But there is no provisions for chaplains. These
                                    vol unteers are chiefly young men - most all of them are either
                                    members of the church or of professing Christian families,
                                    desirous of religious services on the Sabbath, and the
                                    consolations of religion on all occasions.
                                The resolution was adopted.
                                Mr. JONES of Vermillion moved for a suspension of the rules and
                                    constitutional provision in order to the consideration of his
                                    prison bill [13] on the second reading.
                                Mr. SMITH of Bartholomew, said these Prison Directors were asking
                                    for $20,000 for tools and materials for working the convicts, at
                                    a time when he believed their work would not be worth the outlay
                                    for stock. And he did not know what they wanted with $10,000 for
                                    contingents beyond what had been already lately appropriated. He
                                    was opposed to spending any money in that direction, until we
                                    can have assurance that we shall get it back. He thought it
                                    better for the present to feed them, and keep them without work,
                                    if it must be so.
                                The Clerk reported no quorum voting on the yeas and nays,to
                                    suspend the rules: and then -
                                The House adjourned till Monday morning 9 o'clock.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            MONDAY, April 29, 1861.
                        
                        The PRESIDENT laid before the Senate a communication from the Adjutant
                            General of the Indiana militia, enclosing a report of the number of
                            volunteer companies reporting themselves as ready for duty; which,
                            together with sundry instructions following a proposition to refer to
                            the Military Committee, was laid on the table.
                        Mr. STEELE introduced a joint resolution, S. No. 3, which was read and
                            referred to the Committee on Federal Relations.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB, from the Judiciary Committee, returned
                            his bill No. 8, introduced
                            yesterday morning, recommending passage.
                        The report was concurred in.
                        On motion by Mr. WOLFE, the joint resolution, H. R. 1, printed in the
                            House proceedings of Friday morning, was taken up, and being read, he
                            proposed an amendment as follows:
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That in thus pledging the State
                                        of Indiana to the maintenance of the Federal Union, it is
                                        not the intention of this State that any of her resources of
                                        either men or money, shall ever be employed either directly
                                        or indirectly in any aggression upon the institution of
                                        slavery or any other constitutional right which belongs to
                                        any of the States, and that while Indiana is not willing to
                                        surrender any of her constitutional rights, it is her ardent
                                        desire that the present unhappy difficulties shall be
                                        speedily settled in a manner alike honorable and
                                        satisfactory to all sections of the Union, and to that end
                                        our Senators in Congress are instructed and our
                                        Representatives requested to vote for the calling of a
                                        Convention of the States or any other proposition looking to
                                        a speedy, honorable and peaceful solution of our national
                                        troubles.
                                
                            
                        
                        On motion by Mr. MELLETT, the joint resolution and amendments were
                            referred to the Committee on Federal Relations.
                        Mr. STUDABAKER, from the committee on finance,
                            returned the bill [H. R. 12.] "to provide for the defense of the State
                            of Indiana" &c., recommending its, passage, with the following
                            amendments:
                        Insert after the word "men" in the second line on the second page, these
                            words, "including such as are now our land fit for service, and such as
                            he may be able to procure from the General Government." Amend by
                            striking out the word "six," where it occurs in the second section, and
                            insert the word "five."
                        The report was concurred in, and the amendments were adopted.
                        Mr. COBB moved to recommit the bill with instructions to strike out
                            "$500,000," and insert in lieu thereof, "$300,000."  On motion by Mr. HULL, the motion was laid
                            on the table.
                        On motion by Mr. STUDABAKER, the bill was considered as engrossed and
                            read the third time.
                        Mr. COBB. I think $500,000 is too much for the State of Indiana to
                            appropriate for the purchase of arms. It seems to me that we are
                            legislating upon the principle that Indiana is a free and independent
                            nation of itself, and that it goes into this war as such, to fight its
                            own battles against the world. Why, sir, I understand that the Federal
                            Government is the great prime leader in this war, if we have a war at
                            all, and that the government of the United States owes to the State of
                            Indiana protection. And when we have once purchased arms for the State,
                            there is no obligation upon the General Government to take the arms from
                            us, and pay back the money. Do we want stands of arms for 20,000 men, in
                            addition to what we have and what the General Government will give us?
                            It is the duty of the General Government to supply the State of Indiana
                            with arms, and not only arms but men and means by which we can be
                            protected. It seems to me that the principle upon which this bill is
                            based, is that the State, of Indiana is to go to war with enemies
                            surrounding her everywhere, and that she will look to no other source
                            than that of her citizens for protection. It looks to me to be
                            unnecessary to provide such a large sum. I maybe mistaken, but I cannot
                            consent now to cast my vote for this bill. I am willing to go to the
                            full extent of the necessity; but it seems to me that when the State
                            plunges herself into debt a half a million of dollars in this way, it is
                            going beyond what the state of the case requires. Whenever the necessity
                            of the case arises for the appropriation of half a million of dollars
                            with which to buy arms, I shall be as anxious as any man to cast my vote
                            for it; but I do not conceive that necessity has arisen, nor do I
                            believe it ever will arise. I believe the Government of the United
                            States has implements of warfare sufficient to supply all the wants of
                            its armies; but if the General Government is deficient, the General
                            Government will buy as soon as the State of Indiana can. I understand
                            the General Govern merit is buying all the arms necessary to carry on
                            the war. That we owe allegiance to that government is proven by the acts
                            of the State of Indiana; and the General Government owes us
                            protection.
                        Mr. CLAYPOOL. I do not understand that it is the duty of the General
                            Government to arm the citizen soldiery or the volunteers of the State of
                            Indiana. The first thing which ought to be done by this Senate is to
                            determine, if it is not already) determined, whether there is or is not
                            a war necessity upon us. I think it is determined, and I think we ought
                            to act upon this bill and vote upon it to-day, and show the country that
                            we are going to do something. Under the provisions of this bill not a
                            dollar of this money need be expended if the arms are in Indiana or if
                            they can be procured from the General Government. I would arm the
                            citizens of the State with a jack knife if I could not do anything more.
                            I would not stick here in a state of inactivity while we are in a state
                            of war. This is the first bill which has been introduced here that
                            amounts to anything, and I say pass it. I trust it will pass just
                            exactly as it is.
                        Mr. HAMILTON. We ought to provide the State of Indiana with arms. * * * I
                            have learned not to count the cost in this matter, though I believe I am
                            in the habit of counting the cost as much as any other gentleman upon
                            this floor. This is not the time for economy; it is the time for action,
                            and I trust this bill will pass.
                        Mr. WOLFE. I believe the State ought to have arms, but the simple
                            question is how are to get them? I have not been able to ascertain
                            whether the General Government is enabled to furnish us arms, and if it
                            does not then we should be in a position to supply ourselves, and that
                            is what the bill itself contemplates. I was not in favor of the passage
                            of this bill as it came from the House, but I think the amendments of
                            the committee cover all objections. If adequate provisions are not made
                            by this Legislature to meet the wants of the people in this emergency,
                            then the people along the border counties will be compelled to make
                            appropriations to defend themselves; and if we arm ourselves at the
                            expense of the counties we never can come up here and ask the
                            Legislature to relieve us, for there is a constitutional; provision
                            which prevents the State from ever refunding a debt incurred by a
                            county. Will you then say that the people of the border States shall
                            bear this great burden?
                        Mr. President CRAVENS. (Mr. Tarkington in the chair.) It is true the
                            General Government will arm us when it has the power, but when its
                            strong arm has been paralyzed by treason, shall we remain with our hands
                            folded, and say to the General Government, "Arm us, it is your war?" The
                            border belongs to the people of Indiana and to the' Republic. Is it not
                            in danger? Who knows but that the foe is on us now? We have no guarantee
                            that Kentucky has not gone out of the Union. But she is doing the people
                            of Indiana and this republic more harm than though she were among the
                            secession States. Her people are trampled down, arms are in the hands of
                            the secessionists, and Union sentiments are suppressed. Let us have no
                            more hesitation and delay. We have six regiments of troops mustered into
                            the service of the United States, and there have not been arms enough to
                            arm these men by one thousand. Yet we must fold our arms and wait -
                            wait, till we are tied hand and foot. Sir, I hope the vote will be taken
                            on this bill, and that we will have no more of this waiting for
                            conviction.
                        Mr. STUDABAKER, We must place in the hands of the Governor means and some
                            discretion of power to act as the emergency arises. I have no idea - I
                            do not distrust him for a moment. I cannot think, if we do place in the
                            hands of the Executive this power, that he will abuse it. I believe that
                            the emergency of the times requires us to so act, and I think this bill
                            should be passed without delay.
                        Mr. MARCH. I have no desire to run any bill helter skelter through this
                            body. Unless every Senator expresses his opinion here freely, there is
                            no certainty as to the correctness of our conclusions. If we can come
                            out right, and I  have no doubt but
                            we will, I have no doubt the General Government will remunerate the
                            State, It has been done heretofore. It was done in the lust war with
                            Great Britain. I trust this bill will pass unanimously.
                        The bill finally passed the Senate by yeas 39, nays 0.
                        And then came the recess till 2.
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            Mr. MELLETT, from the Committee on Military
                                    Affairs, returned the joint resolution [H. R. No. 2,]

                                words "one thousand" and insert in lieu thereof, the words "five
                                thousand." And insert after the words "counties of" the words
                                "Dearborn, Ohio, Switzerland and Jefferson." And by adding after the
                                word "Posey" the following: "Said arms to be sent and distributed in
                                accordance with an act entitled an act to organize the militia,
                                providing for the appointment and prescribing the duties of certain
                                officers thereof." Approved June 14, 1852.
                            The report was concurred in and the amendment adopted.
                            On motion by Mr. SLACK, the resolution was further amended by adding
                                in the proper place the words, "to be distributed at the discretion
                                of the Governor."
                            The resolution, as amended, was passed the Senate by yeas 36, nays
                                0.
                            Mr. COBB, from the Committee on Military Affairs,
                                returned Senator Ferguson's bill, No. 10, introduced Saturday,
                                recommending that no further legislation is necessary on the
                                subject.
                            On motion by Mr. MILLER, the bill was recommitted.
                            Mr. MILLER, from the Committee on Military
                                Affairs, returned Senator Line's bill No. 3, introduced on
                                Thursday, recommending that it lie on the table; legislation upon
                                the subject being deemed inexpedient.
                            The report was concurred inaffirmative 20, negative 8.
                            Mr. MILLETT, from the Committee on Military
                                    affairs, returned Senator Wagner's bill, No. 1,
                                introduced Thursday, recommending its passage with the following
                                amendments:
                            Strike out section one, from the enacting clause, and insert in lieu
                                thereof these words: "That the Governor be authorized and required
                                to call into the active service of the State six regiments of
                                volunteer militia, to be composed of the companies which have been
                                organized and reported to the Adjutant General under and pursuant to
                                the proclamation of the Governor, and which have not been mustered
                                into the service of the United States, to be received and mustered
                                into the service of the State in the order in which they were
                                organized and reported to the Adjutant General. And if the companies
                                so organized and reported are not sufficient to constitute the
                                number hereby required, companies in counties which have no
                                companies in the service of the State or United States, shall have
                                the preference in the order in which they may be tendered. Said
                                regiments, when so called into service, are to serve for the term of
                                twelve months, unless sooner discharged by the Governor. The said
                                six regiments to be divided into cavalry, artillery and infantry by
                                the Governor, as the service may demand."
                            Amend section three by striking out the words "four Brigadier
                                Generals" and inserting "two Brigadier Generals;" and strike out
                                section six.
                            Mr. WOLFE moved to amend by adding to the 4th section the
                                following:
                            And while in the active service of the State the officers shall
                                receive one-half of said compensation, and when retired from active
                                service said officers and privates shall receive one-half the pay
                                which they receive in the active service of the State.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. I trust the necessity for keeping these troops in the
                                field will have passed within three months, six months or twelve
                                months, and I am willing to pay them so that they will be a credit
                                to the State and not a disgrace. I believe it is our policy, and
                                that it is economy to give such salary as will command the best
                                talent of the State. I know there are men wholly unfitted, which
                                will rush forward, and if they appoint such persons they are
                                criminal before the people of the State, and little short of guilty
                                of murder. I should consider any man criminal that would be willing
                                to accept a position who had not the qualifications and some
                                training in this line. Let us hold out inducements for men to
                                educate themselves in this profession.
                            Mr. MARCH proposed to amend the amendment by striking out "one half"
                                and inserting "three-quarters" To be an officer, and command 100,000
                                men, and wheel then in such a manner as to strike an effective blow,
                                does require the highest human capacity. I want to know if there
                                should be that distinction in the pay of officers and men? They are
                                fighting not for pay, not for a tyrant nor for a throne, but for the
                                principle of free government, for the most glorious flag that ever
                                floated in the breeze of Heaven. Whenever these men are called into
                                active service, then I am willing to pay them full pay. The
                                commissioned officers in Ohio only get half pay, and I believe when
                                we propose to pay them three-fourths, it is liberal.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON moved to lay the amendment on the table.
                            Mr. CARNAHAN moved to include the bill in the motion to table.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON seconded a division of the question.

                            The Senate refused to table Mr. March's amendment by yeas 15, nays

                            Mr. SLACK offered the following amendment:
                            "Said companies shall be received and mustered into service in the
                                order the rolls are filed and the companies marched to the
                                Capital."
                            On Mr. STEELE'S motion this amendment was laid on the table.
                            Mr. March's amendment was then agreed to.
                            Mr. RAY offered the following amendment:
                            Amend by adding in the proper place the following: "One of which
                                regiments shall be cavalry. The cavalry shall be enlisted for and
                                during the war, unless sooner discharged. The regiment already
                                offered having been tendered for the war, and having been accepted

                                or when it shall appear to the Governor that their services are no
                                longer necessary for home protection or drill for the service of the

                                                preamble and resolutions be signed by the President

                                Mr. LINE. Mr. President, the Hon. Richard Robbins was born at
                                    Madison, in the county of Jefferson, while our State was a
                                    territory, in the year 1811, from thence he moved to the county
                                    of Preble, Ohio - spent two winters in the Miami University with
                                    the proceeds of his own labor - graduated in the Cincinnati
                                    Medical College - spent one winter in the practice of his
                                    profession in Louisiana - returned to the county of Rush in this
                                    State, where he sold goods and superintended a farm for several
                                    years, and also practiced medicine - moved to Cincinnati and
                                    engaged in the wholesale grocery business for one year. In 1854
                                    he removed from Cincinnati to Greensburg, and commenced the
                                    study of law, in 1855 was admitted to the bar, and commenced the
                                    practice of law, with good success. In politics, the deceased
                                    was a Republican, and though warm and ardent in the support of
                                    his political principles, he was courteous and liberal towards
                                    those who differed with him in these matters. In 1856 he was a
                                    delegate to the Philadelphia convention, which nominated John C.
                                    Fremont for the Presidency. In 1860 he was nominated by his
                                    political party, as a candidate for a seat in this body, from
                                    the county of Decatur, and was elected over his opponent by a
                                    majority of 312. At the commencement of the last regular
                                    session, the deceased came to Indianapolis, and though he
                                    remained here some thirty days, owing to his extreme debility,
                                    he was only able to be in his seat some eight or ten days. On
                                    the 6th of February last, he returned home to receive those kind
                                    offices which only a wife and friends can bestow in the hours of
                                    affliction, and never left his room till his decease, which
                                    occurred March 14th, 1861. The deceased was a member of the
                                    Presbyterian church, and in all the relations of life shed a
                                    lustre on the Christian profession, and though a family mourn
                                    the loss of a husband, a father, and a friend, they mourn not as
                                    those who have no hope.
                                Mr. DeHART and Mr. CLAYPOOL followed in brief funereal addresses,
                                    and then
                                The resolutions were unanimously adopted.
                                Mr. CLAYPOOL, from the select committee thereon, returned Senator

                                                donated and by whom, and the kind thereof.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                The amendment was agreed to, and so the revolution was

                                            of the General Assembly as may be necessary to correct
                                            such errors as were made in said school law by the
                                            enrolling clerk.

                            Mr. HOLCOMB submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on the Judiciary be instructed to report a
                                            bill, at as early a day as practicable, providing for
                                            the relief of volunteers, in accordance with the
                                            petition of certain citizens of Gibson county, or as
                                            nearly so as said committee may think constitutional and
                                            proper.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. FISHER proposed that it be made a resolution of inquiry.
                            Mr HOLCOMB accepted the modification.
                            Mr. FRASIER. I have before me a general bill for that object,
                                providing for appropriations out of the county treasuries for
                                equipping volunteers and providing for their families.
                            The SPEAKER. The Gibson county petition was for exempting the
                                property of volunteers from execution during their term of
                                service.
                            The resolution was adopted
                        
                        
                            BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                            Mr. PACKARD submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Door-keeper contract
                                            with the proprietors for six hundred copies of Drapier's
                                            Brevier Legislative Reports, embracing the proceedings
                                            and debates of the present session of the General
                                            Assembly for the use of members of the House of
                                            Representatives; the same to be paper covered and
                                            delivered to the Secretary of State, and by him to be
                                            sent by mail - six copies to each member - as soon as
                                            possible after the adjournment of the session: Provided
                                            said Reports shall not cost more than one-third of one
                                            cent a page per copy.
                                    
                                
                            
                            After debate by Messrs. Packard, Owens, Moss, Moorman, Fisher,
                                Frasier and Dobbins, the resolution was adopted - affirmative 30,
                                negative 19.
                        
                        
                            CAVALRY ARMS.
                            Mr. PACKARD submitted the following:
                            WHEREAS, It is understood that the General Government is now in
                                possession of a large amount of arms and accoutrements necessary for
                                the equipment of cavalry regiments, therefore,
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Be it resolved, (the Senate
                                            concurring,) That the Governor be instructed to make a
                                            requisition on the General Government for 800
                                            breech-loading carbines, cartridges, pistols, sabres,
                                            saddles, bridles, tents and all other accoutrements
                                            necessary to equip 800 cavalry.
                                    
                                
                            
                            He said it was known to gentlemen that there was now in progress, and
                                perhaps perfected, (should the Legislature provide for its
                                equipment,) an organization for raising a regiment of Indiana
                                cavalry. It was also known that there is now in the possession of
                                the United States a large amount of cavalry equipments. It was also
                                known that of the 75,000 troops called out by the President, there
                                has been no cavalry regiment named, and these cavalry arms and
                                equipments, it seemed, were to lie useless in the arsenals of the
                                Government. Now, if this regiment of cavalry organize, (and if it
                                does not the resolution can have no effect) the resolution instructs
                                the Governor to apply to the General Government to furnish
                                sufficient amount of accoutrements to arm them, without any cost to
                                the State, except the transportation. The resolution looks only to
                                that.
                            Mr. WOODHULL was not acquainted with any law authorizing this call on
                                the General Government; but he was well satisfied that the General
                                Government would not furnish arms beyond what might be necessary to
                                arm and equip such troops as the President has required, or may
                                hereafter require of us. He saw from the papers this morning, that
                                there would be a call for a hundred thousand more troops, and that
                                would give opportunity for all our patriotic citizens to act without
                                this resolution.
                            Mr. FRASIER suggested the propriety of making the requisition a request of the General Government.
                            Mr. PACKARD accepted the modification.
                            The SPEAKER said: There is a law of Congress for the distribution of
                                the public arms, according to the ratio of congressional
                                representation. That distribution has been made. And whilst it might
                                be the wish of the General Government, to make the distribution
                                proposed in the resolution, there is no law authorizing it. The
                                resolution is, that the Governor make a request for cavalry arms.
                                The chair would say that that request has been already
                                made and urged by the Governor upon the General Government, for
                                every description of arms. It was made in connection with the twelve
                                regiment matter suggested by Gen. Wallace, and the application was
                                made to embrace every description of arms. The regiment of cavalry
                                was particularly mentioned. There can be no harm, certainly, in the
                                resolution. It may'be that the General Government would comply the
                                more readily by the request being backed up by legislation.
                            Mr. FISHER. It could do no harm, unless it might lead us to rely upon
                                that source, and be disappointed; and so fail of the needful
                                provision of arms for ourselves. He objected decidedly to relying
                                upon the General Government for these arms, in any way, so as to
                                prevent action here.
                            The resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            COMMERCE WITH THE SOUTH.
                            Mr. NEWMAN submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Judiciary
                                                Committee be instructed to inquire into
                                            the propriety of enacting a law to prohibit the sale of
                                            produce or other articles of trade to such States, or
                                            the citizens of such States, as will not respond to the
                                            President's call for men to maintain the authority of
                                            the General Government, and report by bill or
                                            otherwise.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. NEWMAN. I think there is matter of importance involved in this
                                resolution. I do not  myself
                                know whether it would be practicable or constitutional to make a law
                                of that character; but if it can be done in my judgment it is
                                certainly expedient and right that such a law should be enacted.
                                That resolution is only a resolution of inquiry; and I think it one
                                that our people are deeply interested in. For if there are those in
                                this State disposed to go on and furnish articles of produce and
                                trade to States that are inimical or whose position make them
                                inimical to the Federal Government, I think it is time we should
                                take notice of it. Every means should be resorted to in the power of
                                the State to cut off and forbid everything, that will furnish aid
                                and comfort to our enemies. And I can not but regard every State
                                that refuses to supply men, and every man that will adhere to such
                                State, as an enemy of the General Government; and I therefore think
                                it behooves us to cut oil their supplies from our State. The State
                                pretending ,to a neutral position, it seems to me, is in a worsea
                                more dangerously hostile position - than those openly against us.
                                They may screen their conduct under a plea that they are still in
                                the Union. I take it, sir, that Kentucky, or any other State, taking
                                a neutral position in the present issue, should be regarded as more
                                dangerous enemies of the Government, than those who come out as
                                entirely opposed to us. Hence I do not know of but one way of
                                getting at this matter. I have no mature plan of my own. Therefore I
                                have thought it prudent to refer the matter to those men of talents
                                and information and influence in the Suite composing the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary.
                            Mr DOBBINS. If we wished to bankrupt our producing and trading
                                people, we might pass that resolution. But has the State of Indiana
                                the power to break down the commerce between friendly and loyal
                                citizens? If we wished to make war, we should adopt the resolution.
                                He told the House that a large majority of the people of Kentucky
                                were now, and ever would be, loyal to the American flag, if they
                                were not driven away from us by unreasonable distrusts, and
                                proceedings to make them our enemies by legislative attempts to cut
                                off intercourse and suppress the spontaneous and mutually
                                advantageous acts of good neighborhood. The doctrine of secession
                                was an unreasonable pretence, and could never be recognized as a
                                political right.
                            Mr. NEBEKER also held that the doctrine of secession was a deception,
                                and that in fact no State was yet out of the Union. But the
                                resolution was unnecessary. These articles were contraband of war,
                                and Kentucky did not want them. There should be nothing done in this
                                way now, even if we had constitutional authority to pass such a
                                law.
                            Mr. HOWARD was in the city of Louisville yesterday, and understood
                                that the Mayor had made his request of the railroad not to permit
                                shipments of provisions South. Also that the city authorities hud
                                made an agreement not to suffer provisions to be shipped for the
                                Southern army. He trusted that Louisville was as loyal as
                                Cincinnati, or Madison, or Jeffersonville, or New Albany, and that a
                                majority of the people of the State of Kentucky were decided Union
                                men. He earnestly deprecated the resolution, and any legislation
                                that might rouse feelings of distrust, awaken local jealousies, or
                                seem to recognize any lack of national fellowship.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN (Mr. McLean in the Chair) suggested that as the
                                House was thin, it would be well to postpone the further
                                consideration of the resolution till two o'clock.
                            The subject was postponed accordingly.
                        
                        
                            VOLUNTEER AID BILL.
                            Mr. FRASIER, from the Committee on County and Township
                                    Business, returned Mr. Veatch's volunteer aid bill,
                                (6) with sundry verbal amendments, which were concurred in, and the
                                bill was ordered to be engrossed.
                        
                        
                            SCULPTURES FOR THE VOLUNTEERS.
                            Mr. ORR submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Governor cause an
                                            investigation to be hid in the Regiments of this State
                                            now mustered into the service , of the General
                                            Government, to ascertain whether each Regiment has a
                                            sufficient supply of the Scriptures for all its men; and
                                            if not, that measures be taken to furnish a copy of the
                                            Scriptures to every man of said Regiments who is not
                                            supplied with the same.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN (Mr. McLean in the chair,) submitted that it would
                                be better that an appropriation be made for furnishing these
                                Scriptures, stating that various versions of the scriptures should
                                be furnished,for the Catholic a Catholic version, for the Protestant
                                a Protestant version, &c.
                            Mr. FRASIER had understood that the different religious denominations
                                in this city had taken this matter in hand.
                            Mr. DAVIS considered that this matter more properly belonged to the
                                people of the counties furnishing these regiments.
                            Mr. ORR. The object of the resolution was merely to perfect the
                                Chaplain resolution of the gentleman from Porter, (Mr. Cameron.) But
                                since the matter was being moved in the religious societies, and the
                                men were likely to be supplied from that source, he was willing, and
                                had leave to withdraw the resolution.
                            Mr. HOLCOMB presented the petition from many citizens of Gibson
                                county, praying for authority for the Board of County Commisioners
                                to raise volunteers and supply their families; which, being already
                                provided for in a bill on the calendar, was laid on the table.
                        
                        
                            EXTENSION OF STAY OF EXECUTION.
                            Mr. MORE introduced a bill [15] to amend Sec. 420 of the Practice
                                Act, of June, 18, 1852, [extending the stay on executions generally

                                any case where either the State ot Indiana or a white person is a
                                party.

                            The Speaker laid before the House a letter from the Secretary of
                                State, communicating the Governor's veto of the Judiciary

                                On motion by Mr. FISHER, the House now took up the consideration
                                    of the special order, viz. Mr. Newman's non-commercial
                                    intercourse resolution, submitted this forenoon.
                                Mr. GRESHAM showed the impropriety of the resolution from such
                                    facts as that the people of Kentucky were not responsible for
                                    the extra-official acts of their Governor, and that there were
                                    as loyal men in Kentucky as in Indiana; and it was no time now
                                    to talk about suspending intercourse. On his motion the
                                    resolution was laid on the table.
                            
                            
                                VOLUNTEER FAMILY RELIEF AND SUPPORT.
                                On motion by Mr. FISHER Mr. Veatch's volunteer family support and
                                    relief bill (6) was taken up and considered on the third
                                    reading.
                                Mr. CRAIN moved that a provision be added authorizing and
                                    legalizing former appropriations for volunteer support by County
                                    Boards. It was agreed to by unanimous consent, and the bill was
                                    amended accordingly.
                                Mr. GRESHAM feared that the discretion which this bill gives to
                                    the County Commissioners would be very liable to abuse.
                                Mr. FRASIER was unwilling that the brunt of this burden and
                                    expense should be borne by a lew liberal and patriotic men in
                                    the counties. The discretion might be abused; but liability of
                                    abuse of this discretion had little weight with him against the
                                    greater evil of the inequality of bearing this burden of the
                                    military service which would obtain in the absence of this
                                    legislation.
                                

                                Mr. ATKISSON and Mr. PARRETT concurred with Mr. Frasier, and
                                    added views of their own.
                                Mr. VEATCH said that the people of the several counties would
                                    know whether there was need of this expense or not. If they were
                                    willing to tax themselves in this emergency, let them, do so. He
                                    did not believe they would go beyond the necessary point. He was
                                    in favor of the immediate passage of the bill.
                                The bill was passed the final reading - yeas, 73, nays 3 - with
                                    an amendment, adding these words: "and legalizing former
                                    appropriations."
                            
                            
                                "AID AND CREATURE COMFORTS."
                                Mr. FRASIER submitted the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the
                                                  Judiciary Committee be
                                                instructed to inquire what, if any, legislation is
                                                necessary to prevent the exportation from this State
                                                of provisions and military stores to any such other
                                                State or States in rebellion against the Government
                                                of the United States, as will allow such provisions
                                                or stores to be transported through their
                                                territories to the public enemies, and to report to
                                                this House by bill or otherwise.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                He hoped this resolution would not be laid on the table as Mr.
                                    Newman's had been. He did not like the tone of the resolution of
                                    Mr. Newman. He would not hold the people of Kentucky responsible
                                    for the act of their Governor. But he was unwilling that
                                    Kentucky should make herself ii highway over which to carry
                                    supplies to the public enemies of the Constitution in the cotton
                                    States. There was plenty of troops in the Northern States, but
                                    the great interests of the country must not come to injury by
                                    the cupidity of anybody in Kentucky or anywhere else. He wished
                                    the committee to report.
                                Mr. NEBEKER. Was it not, better to leave this to the military law
                                    to declare what commerce is contrabrand of war?
                                Mr. FRASIER. We are not under military but under civil law.
                                Mr. GROVER demanded the previous question and under its force the
                                    resolution was adopted.
                                The House then adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            TUESDAY, April 30, 1861.
                        
                        The Senate was called to order by Mr. LINE the President being absent
                            from the city.
                        On motion of Mr. De HART, the reading of yesterday's journal was
                            dispensed with.
                        Mr. STUDABAKER, from the Judiciary Committee, returned
                            Senator Stone's bill, (12) recommending passage.
                        The report was concurred in.
                        On motion by Mr. STONE, the bill was considered as engrossed, read the
                            third time, and finally passed by yeas 38, nays 0.
                        Mr. STEELE, from the Committee on Federal Relations,
                            returned his joint resolution [S. 3] (introduced yesterday,) as
                            follows:
                        Joint resolution in relation to neutrality in time of war, and to certain
                            constitutional obligations which rest upon the Government of the United
                            States, and on the several State governments of the Union:
                        
                            
                                
                                    1. Be it resolved by the General Assembly of the
                                            State of Indiana, That in a time of war between the
                                        Government of the United States and its enemies, no State of
                                        the Union has a right to repudiate its constitutional
                                        obligation; so far as to assert its neutrality in such a
                                        war.
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    2. Be it further resolved, That a
                                        constitutional obligation rests upon the General Government
                                        of the United States, and upon the several State
                                        governments, to support the National Constitution, enforce
                                        the laws, and protect the lives, liberties, property, and
                                        all constitutional rights of citizens in all parts of the
                                        Union. That the people of Indiana acknowledge the binding
                                        force of this obligation, and that under the authority of
                                        the United States they will hold themselves in readiness to
                                        furnish military force to co-operate with the friends of the
                                        Union in any State where the constitutional rights of
                                        patriotic citizen are or shall be assailed by traitors and
                                        armed enemies the National Government.
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    3. Be it further resolved, That no
                                        intention exists on the part of the people of Indiana to
                                        interfere, in any way with the laws or the domestic
                                        institutions of Kentucky or any other State.
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    Be it further resolved, That the people of
                                        Indiana remember, with gratitude, the gallant conduct of
                                        Kentuckians who came as volunteers and poured out their
                                        blood at Tippecanoe, and at other battlefields within our
                                        borders to aid in protecting the wives, and daughters, and
                                        children of Indianians from the tomahawk and scalping-knife
                                        of savages; and that we stand ready at the call of
                                        Kentuckians to aid them as brothers, relatives and friends
                                        in the defense of their homes and firesides, against the
                                        assaults of all enemies, especially those who, under the
                                        traitorous secession flag of South Carolina, are in open
                                        rebellion against the glorious old flag of the Union which
                                        "must and shall be preserved."
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    Be it further resolved, That his Excellency
                                        the Governor of Indiana, be and he is hereby requested to
                                        transmit a copy of these resolutions to the President of the
                                        United States and to the several Governors of the States of
                                        the Union.
                                
                            
                        
                        Recommending passage with the following amendment:
                        Add to the third resolution, the following: "Nor is it the intention of
                            the State of Indiana that any portion of her resources of either men or
                            money shall ever be employed, either directly or indirectly in any
                            agression upon the institution of slavery or any other constitutional
                            right belonging to any of the States."
                        This report was concurred in and so the amendment was adopted.
                        Mr. STEELE. The first resolution concerns plates that it would be a
                            matter of impossibility for a State to remain neutral in time of war. We
                            don't even say by these resolutions that there is war in the country;
                            but we see a prospect of war. The resolutions contemplate that wherever
                            the American flag is, there will Indiana go. Our relatives live in
                            Kentucky, and it is with great reluctance that we would go to war with
                            them. Still there is but one side with me, and that is the side of my
                            country. To-day I would go to Kentucky and help them fight for their
                            constitutional rights as quick as I would go. anywhere, where our people
                            may be assailed by traitors to the General Government. This
                            administration is not going to war on account of the peculiar
                            institution of slavery, as is said to be the case in many parts of the
                            country. We have raised our immense army only for the purpose of
                            defending our flag, not against Kentucky, Missouri, or Maryland, but
                            against its secession assailants. At the Charleston Democratic
                            Convention, last May, could be seen the disposition that the people
                            there never would consent to the will of the majority. There is where
                            secession commenced there was the first secession in this country, by
                            the seven States who are now in rebellion to the flag of this country -
                            they said to Mr. Douglas "you are not for us, and notwithstanding you
                            are here with a clear majority of all the delegates, you shall not be
                            nominated, the majority shall not rule;" so they broke up the convention
                            in a row, and determined that the majority should not rule in the
                            nomination of a Presidential can->  didate. There is one of the places where they proved to him and his
                            numerous friends throughout the North that the thing would have been the
                            same if he had been nominated that it was with Mr. Lincoln; they
                            denounced him as a traitor for what? because he said he favored a
                            doctrine that they did not subscribe to, and that was that the majority
                            should rule; there was the first secession movement; they are opposed to
                            majorities ruling as you see; they refuse in all their States to refer
                            their ordinances to the people; they are for a military despotism. The
                            reason why I am more anxious for the passage of these resolutions at
                            once is, I think the third resolution shows to Kentucky and all the
                            South, that the representations that we are making war upon them, and
                            raising large armies in Indiana, and by the General Government to
                            liberate their slaves, is all false, as we have secessionists and
                            demagogues that are making those assertions daily. When the friends of
                            the Union who are now stumping Kentucky, stand up and read these
                            resolutions, will the people not believe the legislators of Indiana when
                            they speak out thus manly? I think they will, and it will give strength
                            to all the patriots and friends of the Union, no matter where they are
                            to be found in the South. Pass them and send copies to papers and
                            patriots, and they will not misrepresent our true meaning in
                            Indiana.
                        Mr. DeHART. I have nothing to say against the general spirit of those
                            resolutions, but it occurs to me that they contain an admission that
                            every Republican has been battling against, and that is, that slavery is
                            a constitutional right.
                        Mr. STEELE. That refers to the constitutional light of the several
                            States.
                        Mr. De HART. I can never consent to vote tor any resolution that admits
                            slavery to be a constitutional right, and would prefer to see the word
                            "other" stricken out. It would not interfere with the sense of the
                            resolutions to strike out that word, and I move to strike out the word
                            "other," where it occurs between "any" and "constitutional rights."
                        Mr. ANTHONY. I think the resolutions are mischievous. I would not
                            hesitate to vote for the first resolution, for it embraces my
                            sentiments; yet there are circumstances in which it might be proper for
                            a State to act as Kentucky does now. It is their business how they act,
                            and not the business of the Legislature of Indiana; for they are
                            endeavoring to accomplish a good work, and I think it highly imprudent
                            for this Legislature to dictate to her. There are other things in the
                            resolutions that are mischievous in their tendency, and not only
                            mischievous, but imprudent. I move to postpone the resolutions till the
                            10th day off May, for I think it proper this Legislature should remain
                            in session till after we learn the position of Kentucky.
                        Mr. STEELE. l would be as willing as the Senator from Cass to strike out
                            the word "other" if it referred to the Constitution of the United
                            States, but it only refers to State constitutions. The resolutions are
                            drawn up very carefully. They can do no harm, and I want them
                            printed.
                        Mr. MARCH. So far as the people of our State are concerned, the
                            resolutions are seemingly a work of supererogation. We might almost just
                            as well resolve that the sun shall shine upon Kentucky, and that we
                            would not attempt to intercept the healthful influence of its rays upon
                            her soil. If the Senator from Cass is correct, then I am in favor of his
                            amendment. I believe the Constitution has no more right to interfere
                            with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists than it
                            has to interfere with the marriage relation.
                        Mr. JOHNSTON. If it is constitutional for Indiana to prohibit slavery, it
                            is just as constitutional for Kentucky to adopt it. I understand a
                            constitutional right to be whatever is not prohibited by the
                            Constitution.
                        Mr. MURRAY. While I would not vote for a resolution recognizing the
                            constitutional right of slavery out of the several States where it
                            exists, still I would like to see these resolutions passed. Let the
                            State of Indiana send out the true ground upon which we stand, and say
                            that we do not intend to make war upon the institution of slavery or any
                            other constitutional right of a State. We should not wait to make this
                            declaration till we get the news that Kentucky shall be put in a
                            position antagonistical to the general government and to this State. Let
                            us tell them we will meet on the soil of Kentucky or on the soil of
                            Indiana, under one American flag, for the upholding of our common cause
                            and the maintenance of the Union alone.
                        Mr. CLAYPOOL. Under a resolution adopted at an early day of this session,
                            I take it these resolutions are not strictly in order, but will not
                            press that point. I do not believe there is any necessity for the
                            passage of a resolution of this kind. We have very few friends in the
                            slave States of this Union upon this question, though other Senators may
                            think differently. I care not what patriotic sentiments may be sent out,
                            we have to meet the united front of the entire fifteen Southern States.
                            While we are passing upon these resolutions of delay and of peace, our
                            friends, as some gentlemen call them, are arming themselves to the
                            teeth. The gentleman from Parke, (Mr. Steele,) may expect to meet his
                            uncles and cousins on the border, with the musket and the knife. For the
                            last six years, the people of the North have been endeavoring to
                            convince the Southern people of our pacific intentions. We have used
                            tufts of grass long enough. In the last six months I have neither read
                            nor heard of a Union sentiment coming from the South which was
                            unconditional. I am willing, however, to vote for the resolutions, as
                            they are perfectly harmless.
                        Mr. MILLER. I think these resolutions, as a whole, would have an
                            irritating effect in the State of Kentucky, a State with which we desire
                            tor remain on the most friendly relations. I am willing to let Kentucky
                            manage her own domestic institutions in her own way, for I believe
                            Kentuckians are as enlightened a people as Indianians. I do not desire
                            to menace any Southern State, for I do not want to see a civil war,
                            though I am willing to put the State of Indiana on a war footing, I am
                            in favor of the motion to postpone.
                        Mr. RAY. I doubt the policy of a State expressing her opinion of a sister
                            State who may entertain a neutral position on any question.
                        
                        Mr. ANTHONY withdrew his motion to postpone.
                        On motion by Mr. WOLFE, the first resolution was stricken out, and Mr.
                            DeHart's motion to strike out the word, "other" was agreed to by
                            consent.
                        On motion by Mr. JOHNSTON, the resolution was further amended by
                            inserting, after the word "Kentuckians," the words "or any other
                            State."
                        On motion by Mr. ANTHONY, and by consent, the word "daughters" was
                            stricken out.
                        The resolution as amended was then adopted by yeas 28, nays 0.
                        On motion by Mr. MURRAY, it was
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Military Affairs inquire into the expediency
                                        of reporting a bill authorizing the Governor, in' his
                                        discretion, to accept the services of one regiment of
                                        cavalry and three battalions of artillery, in addition 10
                                        the six regiments of infantry, to serve twelve months or
                                        during the present domestic difficulties, unless sooner
                                        discharged, provided that said cavalry regiment and
                                        battalions cf artillery can be armed and equipped by the
                                        General Government.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. JOHNSTON offered the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Senate will (the House
                                        concurring therein) adjourn the present session of the
                                        General Assembly of the State of Indiana sine
                                            die on Friday, the 3rd of May. 3861.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. DICKINSON moved to amend by providing; for an adjournment from Friday
                            next, at 11 o'clock A. M., to Tuesday, May 21, at 2 o'clock P. M members
                            not to receive per diem or mileage during the
                            recess.
                        Mr. CAMPBELL moved to further amend the resolution by inserting after the
                            word "adjourn" the words "when through with the business and desire
                            to."
                        Mr. CLAYPOOL offered the following as a substitute for the
                            resolution:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That when we have finished the
                                        business for which we are called together, we will
                                        adjourn.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. JOHNSTON moved to lay this substitute and Mr. Campbell's amendment on
                            the table.
                        Mr. CLAYPOOL demanded a division of the question. The substitute was laid
                            on the table on a division of the Senate - affirmative 17, negative
                            9.
                        Mr. Campbell's amendment was also laid on the table.
                        Mr. WOLFE moved to strike from Mr. Dickinson's amendment all that relates
                            to mileage.
                        Mr. CLAYPOOL made an ineffectual motion - yeas 14, nays 24 - to lay these
                            propositions on the table.
                        On motion by Mr. CONNER, the whole matter was referred to a select
                            committee of five, which the President (Mr. Line in the chair) makes
                            Messrs. Conner, Hall, Johnston, Wolfe and Williams.
                        Messrs. Anthony and Landers asked and obtained leave to vote "aye" on the
                            defense bill (H. R. 12), which passed the Senate yesterday morning.
                        And then came the recess till 2 o'clock.

                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            Mr. RAY introduced a bill [15] to protect the property of the
                                officers and soldiers of the State in the service of the military
                                service of the United States or of this State, and to punish
                                violations of this act, which was read the first time; rules
                                suspended, (two thirds of all members elected voting in the
                                affirmative,) the bill read the second time by title only, and
                                referred to the Judiciary Committee.
                            Pending the above proceedings the Senate was for some time without a
                                quorum.
                            The PRESIDENT [Mr. Line in the Chair] laid before the Senate a
                                lengthy communication from the Commissary General of the Indiana
                                militia, in answer to a Senate resolution of yesterday.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL regarded the communication as failing to answer the
                                interrogatories embraced in the resolution of inquiry, and moved its
                                reference to a select committee of five. This motion was agreed to,
                                and the President [Mr. Line in the Chair] makes the committee
                                consist of Messrs. Claypool, Hamilton, Studabaker, March and
                                Stone.
                            On motion by Mr. CONNER, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of
                                messages from the House of Representatives.
                            The House resolution authorizing the distribution to members of the
                                Legislature of the remaining quantities of the Swamp Land report of
                                1859, was taken up, read and concurred in.
                            The House resolution instructing the Governor to request the General
                                Government to furnish the necessary accoutrements for 800 cavalry,
                                was read and referred to the Committee on Military
                                    Affairs.
                            The bill H. R. No. 6 (introduced by Representative Veatch on Friday)
                                was read the first and second times, under a dispensation of the
                                rules, amended on Mr. Newcombs motion, inserting in the proper place
                                the words "And the corporate authorities of towns and cities," and
                                referred to the Committee on Military
                                Affairs.
                            On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, the order of business was suspended, and
                                his bill, No. 8, introduced
                                Saturday morning, was taken up, read the third time, and finally
                                passed the Senate- yeas 33, nays 2.
                            And then the Senate adjourned.
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            TUESDAY, April 30, 1861.
                        
                        The Clerk called the House to order at 9 o'clock, and announced that the
                            speaker would be absent for the day.
                        On the motion of Mr. STOTSENBERG, it was
                        Ordered That the gentleman from Wabash, [Mr. Fisher,]
                            be requested to take the chair.
                        Mr. Fisher having taken the chair -
                        
                            SILVER COIN A LEGAL TENDER.
                            Mr. BLACK submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the committee
                                                on the judiciary be instructed to inquire
                                            into the expediency of reporting a bill making silver
                                            coin a legal tender in this State.
                                    
                                
                            
                            He said it was known that silver coin, in large sums than $5, was not
                                a legal tender.
                            Mr. PARRETT and Mr. DAVIS considered this a matter for Congress to
                                regulate; and on motion of the matter it was laid on the table.
                            Mr. POLK submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That to send heavy artillery
                                            and troops, to erect fortifications at Jeffersonville,
                                            or any other point
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                        
                    
                

                

                    BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                    BY ARIEL, & W. H. DRAPIER.
                    
                        Vol. V.
                        INDIANAPOLIS, MAY 3, 1861.
                        No. 3
                    
                    
                        
                            
                                
                                    on the Ohio river, would be an act of defiance and insult to
                                        the loyalty and patriotism of Kentucky.
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That such a course must offend
                                        the honor and dignity of that State, and must as a necessary
                                        consequence, make her our enemy.
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That we, the representatives of
                                        the people of Indiana will protest against such a move, so
                                        long as our brethren of Kentucky are at peace with us.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. FRASIER moved to lay the resolution on the table.
                        Mr. GRAIN moved to refer them to the committee on military
                                affairs. The latter motion, having the preference under
                            the rules, was agreed to, and the resolutions were referred.

                        
                            ADJOURNMENT TO A DAY CERTAIN.
                            Mr. HAYS submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That this House, with the
                                            concurrence of the Senate, fix upon the 6th day of May,
                                            as the day of final adjournment, unless an earlier day
                                            shall be fixed upon.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. GRAIN could not see the propriety of adjourning the session at
                                this time. His opinion was, that we ought to get through this week,
                                and then take a recess until we can be informed as to what course
                                will be taken by those States now calling conventions and coming
                                together by their Legislatures. It might be that a session of the
                                Legislature in a short time will be of great value to the State. On
                                his motion the resolution was then laid on the table.
                            Mr. McLEAN submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, by the House of
                                            Representatives, (the Senate concurring,) that the
                                            present session of the General Assembly shall close on
                                            Friday the third day of May, to reassemble again on the
                                            21st day of May.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. NEBEKER considered this would offer a temptation for members to
                                demand their per diem during the recess. He believed they would have
                                a legal right to do so. It might be constitutional to provide by law
                                that we will not have any pay during such recess; but he was in
                                favor of getting through with our business at once.
                            Mr. McLEAN said there would be a necessity for the Legislature to be
                                here about three weeks hence. In the meantime, without any business
                                before us, it were wiser to take the proposed recess, even if
                                members insisted on their per diem, which would not be done.
                            Mr. HOLCOMB proposed to amend by striking out "21st," and inserting
                                "28th," and adding these words: "And members shall not receive any
                                per diem pay during the adjournment."
                            Mr. McLEAN. That would only leave us but five days of the
                                constitutional term. His proposition would leave thirteen days.
                            Mr. FRASIER considered five days would be too short.
                            Mr. HOLCOMB then withdrew his amendments
                            Mr. ORR would now vote for the resolution. Mr. PARRETT saw a
                                determination in the house to do something by resolution.
                            Did members take upon themselves the position of Representatives, and
                                expect to neglect the duty of Representatives here for the sake of
                                their farms? We had just received from the Senate a message that
                                they had passed a bill to raise and equip six regiments for State
                                defence. This and the money bills were before us, and gentlemen were
                                talking about adjournment next Friday night. What was the object of
                                gentlemen in waiting for the action of other States or the
                                Montgomery Congress? Our business here must be done, whatever they
                                do. Would gentlemen tell now anything that we have to do that we
                                can't do just as well now as at any other time? What have we done?
                                What is this session to report to our constituents? We want money.
                                We want to discuss this six regiment bill. We want relief bills. We
                                want to put our banks in a secure position. We want to arm the
                                State. We want to take care of the home interests of the volunteers.
                                And, whenever these things shall be attended to, as they ought to
                                be, this house need not be opened again for legislation till our
                                successors come.
                            Mr. KNOWLTON proposed to amend by substitute, limiting the speeches
                                of members to 12 hours each.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG made an ineffectual motion to lay the resolution and
                                amendment on the table.
                            Mr. CASON demanded the previous question, and, under its operation,
                                Mr. Knowlton's substitute was rejected, Mr. Holcomb's amendment
                                adopted, and then the resolution, as amended, was also adopted.
                            Ordered, That the Clerk acquaint the Senate
                                thereof.
                            Mr. McLEAN, from the Committee on Ways and Means,
                                returned the petition from the President and Trustees of the Indiana
                                Hospital for the Insane, recommending its reference to the
                                    Committee on Benevolent Institutions.
                            The report was concurred in.
                            Mr. FRASIER, from the Committee on County and Township
                                    Business, returned Mr. Black's Saline Fund bill, (9)
                                recommending its passage. He stated that the same bill passed the
                                House at the late regular session, but failed in the Senate.
                            Mr. GRESHAM. I think, as we have determined to adjourn Friday, we
                                should have nothing to do with this sort of legislation. I therefore
                                move that the bill be laid on the table.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                        
                            SIX REGIMENT BILL.
                            On motion by Mr. GRESHAM, the Six Regiment bill [S. 1] was taken up,
                                ana the rules being suspended for the purpose, it was read twice and
                                considered.
                            Mr. KNOWLTON proposed to amend, by inserting after the words,
                                "volunteer militia," these words: "who shall be enlisted for and
                                during the war."
                            Mr. DOBBINS proposed to amend, by adding: "Provided that each company
                                shall elect their own officers; and provided, further, that said
                                companies shall be retained in the counties where they may be
                                organized respectively, until otherwise ordered by the proper
                                officers."
                            Mr. STEPHENSON proposed: "Shall receive no pay while retained from
                                actual service."
                            Mr. KNOWLTON. Insert after the word "volunteers," these words: "To be
                                selected from cavalry companies that have been enrolled for and
                                during the war."
                            The SPEAKER pro tem. There is no cavalry in the
                                bill.
                            Mr. HENRICKS proposed: "And organize and equip a complete corps of
                                sappers and miners, not j to exceed one battalion."
                            Mr. McLEAN proposed: "Provided that no more than one company shall be
                                stationed at the same point in the State, unless in actual
                                service."
                            Mr. GROVER proposed: "Providing for at least one company of artillery
                                for every regiment of infantry."
                            Mr. DOBBINS proposed: "That due regard shall be had for the companies
                                organized along the Ohio river, and give said companies the
                                preference."
                            Mr. HOLCOMB proposed: "Provided that companies from counties that
                                have not yet furnished volunteers shall have the preference."
                            Mr. WOODS: "That companies offered from those counties from which no
                                companies have been mustered into the service shall have the
                                preference in making up the six regiments."
                            On motion by Mr. HOLCOMB, the bill and proposed amendments were
                                referred to the Committee on Military
                                Affairs.
                            On the motion of Mr. WOODHULL, Mr. Edson had leave of absence till
                                tomorrow.
                        
                        
                            EXTENSION OF STAY OF EXECUTION.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG introduced a bill [23] to amend section 412 of the
                                Practice act of June 18, 1852, so as to extend the time for the
                                return of executions and the time of advertisement upon them:
                                [Execution shall be returnable within 365 days, and advertisement
                                made for 90 days,] which was passed to the second reading.
                            On motion by Mr. GRESHAM, Messrs. Brett and Bingham were added to the
                                    Committee on Military Affairs,
                            On motion by Mr. CRANE, the twenty five thousand dollar bill [S. 12,]
                                legalizing the State Auditor's deposit of $30,000 of State bonds, as
                                security for the payment of $25,000 borrowed by the Governor to
                                provide expenses for raising troops under the proclamation of the
                                President of the United States were taken up.
                            On motion by Mr. NEWMAN, (the rules being suspended for the purpose,)
                                the bill was twice read, and referred to the Committee on
                                    the Judiciary.
                            On motion by Mr. LANE, the Senate's amendments to his joint
                                resolution, to supply 5,000 "firelocks" to the Southern counties,
                                (reported by message yesterday,) were taken up and concurred in.
                            Mr. VEATCH introduced a bill [24] to amend the act of March 11, 1861, to provide for a
                                general system of common schools, &c. He said the House will
                                remember that we had something of a contest in regard to the
                                compensation of the Clerk of the Superintendent of Public
                                Instruction. We made it here $800 reducing it from $1,000, but the
                                bill passed the Senate enrollment and signature without that
                                amendment. The bill proposes to correct that and other like errors
                                in the law.
                            The bill was passed to the second reading.
                            On motion by Mr. THOMAS, (the rules being suspended,) it was read
                                again and considered on the second reading.
                            Mr. ORR proposed to make the Superintendent Clerk's compensation
                                $365.
                            Mr. DAVIS proposed to amend so that it shall not be obligatory on the
                                Superintendent to visit the several counties of the State.
                            Mr. BLACK proposed to add a section for printing 5,000 copies and for
                                distributing the same amongst the several counties in proportion to
                                population.
                            On motion by Mr. FRASIER, the bill and proposed amendments were
                                referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
                        
                        
                            TREASON.
                            Mr. FRASIER introduced a bill (25) supplemental to an act entitled,
                                an act defining felony and prescribing punishment therefor, approved
                                June 10, 1852. He said it was the matter of the Senate bill No. 4 of
                                the last session. On his motion the bill was read twice, (the rules
                                being suspended,) and then -
                            On motion by Mr. SMITH, of Bartholomew, referred to the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary.
                        
                        
                            KANKAKEE DRAINING COMPANY.
                            Mr. FRASIER moved to take up Mr. Henrick's bill (20) to repeal the
                                levees and drains corporation act. This bill was one of vital
                                importance to many in the Northern portion of the State. There was a
                                scheme set on foot in Laporte, and incorporated under the levees and
                                drains law, which in its estimates was to affect landholders along
                                the Kankakee river to a large amount - some six millions of dollars
                                -
                            The SPEAKER pro tem. A wide discussion is not
                                properly in order. The bill has not been taken up yet.
                            Mr. FRASIER. I understand it will likely make war among the people
                                there, if this scheme is allowed to go on.
                            The bill was taken up and read the second time.
                            Mr. GRAIN. This levees and drains act has been sometime on our
                                statute book, and great good has been done to the State under it. I
                                can't see any reason for getting rid of it in such a hurry; and for
                                the sake of getting this bill out of the way, I will move that it go
                                to the Judiciary Committee. We should look at it
                                a little before repealing that law.
                            Mr. FRASIER. I admit the propriety of the  remark of the gentleman from Parke,
                                and would myself prefer an amendment to the repeal of that statute.
                                But as it was understood that it would be difficult getting an
                                amendment through this session, it has been thought best to repeal
                                it. It the gentleman will examine that statute of 1852, he will find
                                that it contains no provision by which the company can be compelled
                                to cut one spade full of dirt, though I believe it has, as the
                                gentleman says, done great good in the way of draining in the State
                                of Indiana. But I would ask the gentleman if he has ever visited the
                                Kankakee marsh? I understand there is a scheme on foot for draining
                                that marsh as soon as they can get to work, and they can go on and
                                make assessments upon the land owners for the supposed improvements
                                they are to make by that work. I understand that they estimate that
                                their work will increase the value of Kankakee lands some
                                $6,000,000; and by this immense sum the company expect to be
                                benefitted by this scheme. The amount of their assessments, under
                                the act of 1852, becomes a lien on all the real and personal estate
                                of every land holder whose lands are to be improved in value by
                                their work, and that the collection of this assessment would subject
                                their whole estate to judgment and execution for the payment of
                                these supposed improvements. And the result will be that this
                                company will not only take to themselves all the land lying along
                                that river, but perhaps otherwise injure the owner of this marsh
                                land. I have understood also that the privileges of this company
                                include a sort of banking operation, something like the Logansport
                                Insurance Company, I suppose. Therefore, rather than this thing
                                should go on, it has been thought best to repeal the draining
                                statute.
                            Mr. PACKARD. I consider the bill before the House one of the most
                                important before the session, though certainly not in its beneficial
                                results. I should regret its passage as much as that of any other
                                odious measure. I live in the vicinity of the Kankakee river, and
                                know the men composing that draining company, which I think the
                                gentleman from Kosciusko has not considered. I think he does not
                                understand the interests or the wishes of the people living along
                                that river, nor the objects of the gentlemen composing that company,
                                or he would not remark upon them us he has. He would not pronounce
                                their work a swindle if he knew the men.
                            Mr. FRASIER (interrupting). Is the gentleman from Marshall a member
                                of that draining company?
                            Mr. PACKARD. I am not; nor have I the reputation of making flings at
                                other men's interests, because they'are not connected with me
                                politically. I know, sir, that this Kankakee Draining Company has
                                organized in good faith; and I know that many people of Starke
                                county and of my own esteem their work almost as their temporal
                                salvation. It seems that the cost of this great work is estimated at
                                about $500,000, and it would result in raising the value of the
                                lands there by millions. I should be sorry to see this enterprise
                                stopped in its incipiency, now when so many people are directly
                                interested in it. The gentleman's county, I believe, does not border
                                on the Kankakee, as do the counties of St. Joseph, Marshall, Starke,
                                Laporte and Jasper. Large tracts of their lands are overflowed by
                                the river, which, by a little work, it has been discovered by
                                competent engineers, can be made the most valuable lands in the
                                country. I hope gentlemen will consider this. The best men in the
                                county of Laporte are engaged in this workmen who are above the
                                imputation of any design of swindling - and were it not for the war
                                excitement which takes away all parties engaged in it they would go
                                right on. They will accomplish this great work if let alone, and it
                                will redound largely to the interests of all our people.
                            Mr. KENDRICK said he would like to see an amendment of the law of
                                1856, so that assessments could not be made without the consent of
                                parties.
                            Mr. WOODS. I wish to say to the House that our people are desirous
                                this drain law should be amended. I think if gentlemen will examine
                                the law of 1852, they will find that it confers powers which no
                                people should tolerate. It gives opportunity for the most gigantic
                                swindles. I hope the House will consent that a bill may be presented
                                and considered to amend it. I do not wish to occupy the time of the
                                House, nor to extend the session, but I suppose we could pass such a
                                bill, while we are waiting for reports. I hope a committee will be
                                appointed to draft such a bill.
                            Mr. HENRICKS. I introduced this bill, although I was aware of the
                                feeling of the Legislature, not to go into any matter of general
                                legislation. But the people of my county had earned that a company
                                of gentlemen, living partly in Laporte and in this city, has been
                                formed to drain the Kankakee; and they have discovered that the law
                                authorizes them to levy and collect a heavy tax on them for their
                                proposed work, and at the same time it does not confer upon the
                                people the power to compel them to do any work. They are authorized
                                to assess their tax for improvements without regard to what their
                                work shall cost them; and they say that the whole value of the
                                improvements which they will make for the Kankakee lands will amount
                                to six millions of dollars, and they claim the right to assess and
                                collect that. One man, who has three sections on the Kankakee, and
                                who owns a farm on Portage prairie, has told me that, if this
                                company go on as they propose, and as they can do under that law,
                                that it will break him up - that it will cost him his farm to pay
                                for alleged improvements upon his pasture lands, which, perhaps,
                                after all, would not be anything better than they are now for the
                                purpose of grazing, to which he intends to supply them.
                            Mr. CASON. There seems to be a misapprehension in relation to the
                                legal rights of parties composing this company. I am anxious that
                                this bill should be committed to the Judiciary
                                    committee, for amendment. But when gentlemen imagine
                                and anticipate such great wrongs to arise out of this law, they
                                mistake their legal remedy. The fact is, the owners of the lands
                                improved become part of the company. They have a sufficient remedy
                                by forcing the Directors to apply the assesment money to the work;
                                and if there is any overplus, after the drains are made, as a matter
                                of course it goes, pro rata, to the parties in
                                interest. This law in relation to levees and  drains is one of the best laws in the
                                State. It has done more for our country than any other law on the
                                statute book. Under that law we have had a most magnificent drain
                                made without wrong to anybody; and there are drains now being
                                constructed in our county, and if you repeal this law, you will
                                strike down the work they have now half finished, and they will lose
                                all they have done. I hope it will go to the Committee, and that
                                they will amend the law, but not repeal it.
                            The bill was referred to the Judiciary
                                Committee.
                        
                        
                            JEFFERSONVILLE PRISON.
                            Mr. JONES, of Vermillion's Jeffersonville prison appropriation bill,
                                [13] coming up on the second reading -
                            Mr. SMITH, of Bartholomew, moved that it be referred to the
                                    Judiciary Committee.
                            Mr. GRAIN preferred the committee on ways and
                                    means. There were forty thousand dollars proposed to
                                be appropriated by this bill. But he did not press the motion.
                            Mr. SMITH of Bartholomew wished it to be understood that he would
                                fight this bill at every step.
                            It was referred to the committee on the
                                judiciary.

                            Mr. VEATCH'S school bill, [14,] amending the school law in regard to
                                failures to elect trustees, coming up -
                            Mr. GRAIN made an ineffectual motion to lay it on the table.
                            On motion by Mr. DAVIS it was referred to the committee on
                                    education.
                        
                        
                            STAY OF EXECUTION.
                            Mr. Moss's execution stay bill, [15,] coming up -
                            Mr. CRAIN. This is a bill for the purpose of preventing the
                                collection of debts. I hope no such bill will pass. If Indiana wants
                                to destroy her credit, this is the way to do it. There is no good
                                reason for adopting this measure. There are good reasons against it.
                                We are going into the market for money. Besides we have determined
                                by resolution that none of these general bills shall be passed, and
                                I think it is time that rule should be enforced. I think the bill
                                should be rejected in order that the Legislature may show what their
                                mind is about the collection of debts. I do not know that any
                                portion of our State is bankrupt. If some men in the State are in
                                such a condition that they cannot pay their debts, we should not
                                seem to involve the whole State in the same difficulty. We should
                                especially take care of the credit of the State, now when we are in
                                need of money, and perhaps on the eve of war. I now move to lay the
                                bill on the table.
                            The SPEAKER pro tem. The chair understands the
                                purport of the bill to be to extend the stay of execution to one
                                year on all sums.
                            Mr. Moss and Mr. Stotsenberg demanded the yeas and nays, and they
                                were ordered.
                            Mr, HEFFREN. Will the gentleman withdraw the motion to lay on the
                                table. I will renew it.
                            Mr. CRAIN acquiesced.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Under this courtesy I have but a few words to say. Those
                                who live in the central and northern part of the State, where they
                                purchase goods at other points than Louisville, are differently
                                situated from us who live in the southern portion. When I left there
                                this morning I was told and I was obliged to believe that there
                                would be a general repudiation there on all sides. In my last county
                                paper there were twenty-nine sheriff sales advertised, and only
                                three of the plaintiffs in these cases reside in the State of
                                Indiana. The other twenty-six are citizens of the State of Kentucky.
                                I hope, sir, that this bill will not be laid on the table; because,
                                as far as the people are concerned in our region, if something of
                                this kind is not done here, our creditors in Kentucky will not only
                                possess and own all our property, but they will own us. We are bad
                                off. We bring our Kentucky money here to Indianapolis and we can't
                                pass it but at five per cent discount, and they do the same thing
                                with us at New Albany and Jeffersonville. And we can't take it over
                                to Kentucky to pay our debts because we have not got enough to do
                                it. I hope the House will act prudently and discreetly in this
                                matter. And now, according to promise, I renew the motion to lay on
                                the table; though 1 shall vote against it. I hope the bill will go
                                to a committee.

                            On motion by Mr. STOTSENBERG, it was referred to the

                            The bill was reported to the House without amendment, and with the
                                committee's recommendation that the same do pass.

                                            Robbins, Smith, of Bartholomew, Treer - 14.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. FORD asked to be excused from voting to enable him to say: Unlike
                                some on this floor, I am not inclined to calculate expenses when the
                                country is in danger. I come here for the purpose for the purpose of
                                voting any number of men and any amount of money necessary to
                                support the "stars and stripes." It's too late to count the cost. We
                                are into it, and must get out of it. Whatever amount of money is
                                necessary, I vote it freely; and therefore shall vote aye, if the House consent. [Laughter.]
                            Mr. PARRETT, pro forma. I do not really know, Mr.
                                Speaker, whether this sum is too large or not. But there is one
                                thing about me, and that is, I am not afraid here of either great
                                men or boys; but I am really afraid of this money being
                                extravagantly used.
                            Mr. GRESHAM interposing. This sum not only contemplates the payment
                                of expenses already incurred; but we are going to adjourn shortly,
                                and the President of the United States may make another call on us
                                before a twelve month.
                            Mr. PARRETT. We are herein the midst of the gravest difficulties, and
                                we are voting enormous sums of money: and if we need it it's all
                                right. If necessary, every dollar should go, as far as I am
                                concerned. But this thing of giving out blank receipts, when every
                                dollar is needed to be husbanded with care - whenever everything in
                                action depends so much on money it does seem to me that we cannot be
                                too stringent and cautious in this matter. I vote aye.
                            Mr. SMITH of Bartholomew, pro forma. I am just as
                                willing as my friend from Jackson to vote all the men and money that
                                is necessary, but experience teaches us if more than is needed is
                                appropriated it will be all expended. For that reason I shall vote
                                "no." I would be willing to vote $50,000.
                            Mr. BLACK, pro forma. I am in favor of voting all
                                proper supplies of men and money; but I think this sum is too large.
                                That's the reason I vote "no."
                            Mr. DOBBINS (pro forma). I shall vote against the
                                appropriation of one hundred thousand dollars to be placed in the
                                hands of the Governor, as contemplated in this bill: first, because
                                the bill contains no provision that the General Government shall
                                refund the money to the State; and secondly, because we have had no
                                estimate of what amount will be necessary to meet the contingency. I
                                can not say whether the amount in the bill is sufficient or not. l
                                am ready now and at all times to vote all requisite supplies of men
                                and money to sustain the Union and the majesty of the Government of
                                the United States; but I wish to understand what is right before I
                                act.
                            So the bill passed.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The House resumed the order of the consideration of bills on the
                                second reading.
                            Mr. Owen's amalgam-evidence bill [16] was considered and referred to
                                the Committee on Rights and Privileges.
                            Mr. Jones' Common Pleas bill [18] was referred to the Committee on the
                                    Organization of Courts of Justice.
                            Mr. Black's Recorders' and Surveyors' bill [19] coming up -
                            On motion of Mr. BLACK, it was laid on the table.

                            
                                LEGISLATIVE EXPENSES.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON introduced a bill [26] appropriating $15,000 for
                                    Legislative expenses; and the rules being suspended for the
                                    purpose, it was read twice and considered.
                                Mr. McLEAN proposed to amend the bill after the enacting clause
                                    by substituting the common form, which was adopted.
                                Mr. COLLINS, of Adams, moved to refer the bill to the
                                        Committee on Public Expenditures, by way
                                    of giving that committee something to do. He had never yet seen
                                    a report from that committee.
                                Mr NEBEKER, as Chairman of that committee, detailed some of its
                                    labors, and warmly resented the charge of indolence.
                                The motion to refer did not prevail.
                                On motion of Mr. ROBBINS the bill was ordered to be engrossed for
                                    the third reading, considered to be engrossed, read the third
                                    time and passed - yeas 68, nays 0 - with an amendment of title,
                                    viz: "An act making appropriations for the, expenses of the
                                    present session of the General Assembly."
                            
                            
                                CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATIONS.
                                On motion by Mr. DOBBINS, the joint resolution, S No. 3, (printed
                                    in the Senate proceedings of this day) in relation to certain
                                    constitutional obligations which rest upon the Government of the
                                    United States and upon the several State governments of the
                                    Union, was taken up, He trusted that this resolution would pass
                                    the House by a unanimous vote.
                                Mr FRASIER proposed to amend the joint resolution by striking out
                                    the words "flag of South Carolina" and inserting "flag of the so
                                    called Confederate States."
                                The amendment was rejected.
                                And then the resolution was adopted - yeas 63, nays 2 - 2 present
                                    and refusing to vote.
                            
                            
                                COST OF COMMISSARY GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT.
                                Mr. HENRICKS submitted the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved. That the Commissary
                                                General be requested to report to this House what it
                                                costs per day for rations for each soldier now in
                                                camp; and whether they are supplied or furnished by
                                                contracts; and if so, with whom are contracts made,
                                                and what is the price paid each contractor and if
                                                not supplied by contractors, in what way are they
                                                supplied, and what price is paid for each principal
                                                article of supply?
                                        
                                    
                                
                                His object in introducing this was, that there have been various
                                    fabulous rumors afloat about prices for provisions for the camp
                                    paid by the Commissary General, and he thought it but justice to
                                    that officer that the true state of the case should be made
                                    known.
                                Mr. PARRETT desired to amend by adding an inquiry as to how many
                                    troops are now being kept at the expense of the State.
                                Mr. HENRICKS accepted the amendment, the resolution was
                                    adopted.
                                And then the House adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                    
                         IN SENATE.
                        
                            WEDNESDAY, May 1, 1861.
                        
                        The principal Secretary called the Senate to order, in the continued
                            absence of the President
                        On motion by Mr. STONE, Mr. Tarkington was called to the Chair pro tempore.
                        
                            ADJOURNMENT TO A DAY CERTAIN.
                            On motion by Mr. JOHNSTON, the concurrent resolution passed by the
                                House of Representatives yesterday, providing for a recess of the
                                Legislature from day after to-morrow till the 21st of May, was taken
                                up and read.
                            Mr. STONE offered the following amendment: '"Provided, however, that
                                if in the opinion of the Governor, no necessity exist for the
                                reassembling of the Legislature at the time indicated, and he shall
                                on or before the day of May, 1861, issue his proclamation so
                                stating, then and in that case the present adjournment shall be an
                                adjournment sine die"
                            The concurrent resolution and the pending amendment was referred to
                                the select committee on this subject appointed yesterday.
                        
                        
                            SUPREME COURT ROOMS.
                            Mr. SLACK offered the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, By the Senate, (the House

                            THE SCHOOL LAW.
                            Mr. LINE presented a petition from four citizens of Franklin county,
                                praying an amendment of the school law so that persons transferred
                                to School corporations for school purposes may not be "disfranchised
                                in the election of school officers - thereby subjecting them to
                                taxation without representation," which was referred to the
                                    Committee on Elections.
                        
                        
                            RATIONS FOR VOLUNTEERS.
                            Mr. MARCH introduced a bill [S. No.
                                    16,] entitled "A bill providing for the manner of

                            On motion by Mr. MARCH, the rules were suspended - yeas 41, nays 0 -
                                the bill read the second time by title only, and referred to the
                                    Committee on Finance.
                        
                        
                            A REJECTED PROPOSITION.
                            Mr. CONNER desired to introduce a bill, the purpose of which is to
                                prevent bringing upon the market too large a proportion of State
                                bonds and thereby injure the sale of those necessary to raise money
                                to arm and equip the military forces of the State. He supposed all
                                bills that were intended to aid the credit of the State, by putting
                                us in a condition to meet the present emergency, would be in
                                order.
                            The PRESIDENT, pro tem., decided the bill as out of
                                order under the resolution of Mr. Wolfe, adopted on the second day
                                of this session and printed on page 8 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE
                                REPORTS.
                        
                        
                            MONEY FOR EXPENSES ALREADY INCURRED.
                            On motion by Mr. ANTHONY,the Senate proceeded to the consideration of
                                bills from the House of Representatives.
                            The bill, H. R. 4, (described on page 15 of these Reports,) making an
                                appropriation to defray the expenses of troops, &c., was read
                                the first time.
                            On motion of Mr. STUDABAKER, the rules were suspended - yeas 38, nays
                                0 - the bill read the second time by title only, and referred to the
                                    Committee on Finance.
                        
                        
                            LEGISLATIVE EXPENSES.
                            The bill, [H. R. 26] appropriating $15,000 for expenses of the
                                present Legislature, coming up in order, it was read the first
                                time.
                            On motion by Mr. ANTHONY, the rules were suspended - yeas 37, nays 0
                                - and the bill read the second time by title only.
                            On motion by Mr. SLACK, the bill was considered as engrossed, read
                                the third time and finally passed by yeas 37, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            THE ISSUING OF TREASURY NOTES.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL introduced a bill [S. 17] entitled "a bill authorizing
                                the issuing of treasury notes to the amount of five hundred thousand
                                dollars; and providing that the same shall be receivable for State
                                taxes;" which was read the first time.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. I drew this bill hastily and introduced it for the
                                purpose of getting the subject before the Finance
                                    Committee at this time. I intended to make the
                                denomination of these notes run from ten to one hundred dollars. I
                                see from the anxiety of the Senator from Putnam to get the floor,
                                that he wants to raise a constitutional objection to my bill.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON, (interrupting.) I wish to raise a question of order as
                                to whether this bill is in order under the resolution of the Senator
                                from Harrison, [Mr. Wolfe.]
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. I suppose, as far as that is concerned, it is very
                                clearly in order. It is providing the sinews of war, and I am
                                inclined to the opinion that we cannot have the wind and bottom
                                desired by the Senator from Delaware, [Mr. March] without money. I
                                am inclined to think it is the easiest and most profitable way for
                                the State of Indiana to raise $500,000. Let her issue treasury notes
                                in the similitude of banknotes easy of transfer bearing six per
                                cent, interest; one-half thereof receivable in 1862 for taxes; the
                                other portion falling due a year later, and receivable for taxes the
                                ensuing year; all receivable thereafter until redeemed. I admit that
                                soon after those old treasury notes of 1836 or 1840 were issued they
                                were discredited. Outside of the citizens of the State there was no
                                confidence in them; yet they were not long in the market until the
                                mind of the speculator saw that they offered a finer field for
                                speculation than any bonds ever in the market, and they finally came
                                up to their nominal value, and even commanded a premium. Now if
                                these bonds are issued, and if a law is enacted in substance as the
                                bill provides, there can be no question in my opinion,  but that these bonds will go off at
                                par in Indiana, and you will find a market for them in every county
                                in the State. A citizen who has a thousand dollars to invest can
                                purchase these bonds at par, his money is drawing interest, and he
                                can sell them at their par value with the interest added. You will
                                find that the small and large capitalists of Indiana will seize upon
                                these bonds with avidity. We will be compelled, before we adjourn,
                                to put into market a large amount of bonds, as every other State
                                will have to do, and we cannot hope to go into market with any
                                better credit than Ohio. All I could ask would be to go into the
                                market upon a par with the State of Ohio. If we issue six per cent,
                                bonds, I say they will be sold at not more than 86 cents on the
                                dollar. If a half million of bonds were issued in accordance with
                                the spirit of this bill (I do not say it is complete), those bonds
                                will command dollar per dollar - they will go at par. It is true the
                                Legislature would have to provide for raising a tax sufficent to
                                absorb them for the years 1862 and 1863, and that they ought to do,
                                because no debt should be contracted without providing the means to
                                pay it. I doubt whether we can get our funds off at par in any other
                                shape. If we pass a law authorizing the issuing of bonds, we cannot
                                get them ready for market hort of one month. We cannot get the form
                                prepared and cannot get them really in market short of another
                                month. I say, therefore, under any law we may pass, we cannot get
                                into the market short of two months, and then it will be upon a
                                depressed market, crowded with bonds. Every gentleman knows that
                                capitalists purchase the best bonds, and where they can purchase the
                                cheapest. I think we cannot do anything better than to pass such a
                                law as this. I move that the rules be suspended in order that the
                                bill may be read the second time now.
                            The motion was agreed to - yeas 3.5, nays 1 - and the bill read the
                                second time, by title only.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB moved to refer the bill to the Committee on
                                    Finance, with instructions to amend by providing "that
                                each treasury note shall be registered at the time of its issue, in
                                books to be provided for that purpose, in the office of the Auditor
                                of State and Treasurer of State, and that books shall also be kept
                                showing the date of redemption of each note, and provide also for
                                the cancellation of such treasury notes as fast as redeemed." He
                                hoped the committee will not only take these instructions into
                                consideration, but the question as to how the State may be guarded
                                and kept free from loss by the proceedings incident to such a step
                                as the one proposed in the bill.
                            Mr. CRAVEN offered the following instructions: ''That said bonds
                                shall be of the denomination of ten, twenty, fifty and one hundred
                                dollars equally."
                            Mr. RAY. By the adoption of these several instructions, it amounts in
                                some sense to an indorsement by the Senate of this mode of raising
                                revenue. For one I can not allow the scheme to pass by this sort of
                                an indorsement. I think I shall be compelled to oppose this mode of
                                meeting the expenses of the present crisis. I am in favor of having
                                this thing go along so that the people may know every step; the
                                extent of the indebtedness incurred, and the means provided for its
                                redemption. This is only a draft upon the taxable resources of the
                                State two or three years hence I do not want to contribute to give
                                direction to public affairs in a hasty way, without allowing all the
                                voters of the State to know the responsibility of every step in this
                                movement. I am for doing every thing necessary to sustain the
                                integrity of the Government and sustain the honor of the flag. I am
                                willing to take the responsibility of voting direct burdens upon the
                                people to meet the necessary expenses, but I am not willing to vote
                                indirect burdens to come upon them hereafter. I am desirous of
                                having bonds of the State issued for what money we need, with a
                                taxation on this year's assessment to meet the interest on this
                                debt. We have had some experience on this kind of currency, and the
                                effect is to debauch a currency that is of itself not the best; and
                                we should preserve it in as good condition as it now is. This kind
                                of currency would be regarded by the people as a species of shin
                                plaster, and the effect would be to postpone the burden of taxation
                                for two or three years, when we can much better meet them now. We
                                have ample resources - as much surplus money and produce as we may
                                have at any time in the future. To put this kind of currency in the
                                market we would only postpone the payment of these burdens to an
                                improper period. I believe in paying as we go as far as we can. To
                                meet the war debt we must raise the money by loan, and levy a tax
                                and have it placed on the duplicate of this year, that the people
                                may know what we are doing, and what responsibilities they are
                                incurring. This half million of script is designed to circulate as
                                currency, and because it has some time to run before it matures it
                                will depreciate in the hands of the holders, and however secure it
                                may be, it is not convertable, and any currency
                                not convertable into gold or silver will
                                depreciate in the hands of the people. Finally, when it has reached
                                the lowest point of depreciation, the bankers, brokers and shavers
                                will enjoy their harvest of buying it up at from fifty to eighty
                                cents to the dollar, with the accumulated interest on it, and peddle
                                it out to the tax brokers of the counties as they did the scrip ot
                                1840, when the moneyed men made fortunes in that way I am ready to
                                vote all the money necessary to meet the emergency, but I want to
                                provide tangible means as we go along to meet the interest and
                                extinguish the principal. It is easy to get drunk - hard to get
                                sober. Then I pronounce the scheme, in view of our past experience,
                                to be fraught with ruin to our present bank currency, with loss to
                                the small holders of this depreciated currency, and ultimate
                                peculation and profit to the bankers, brokers and money changers who
                                always profit by the misfortunes of the masses.
                            Mr. LANDERS offered the following additional instructions: amend by
                                adding "that said bonds or treasury notes shall not be sold for less
                                than par."
                            Mr. MARCH moved to amend the instructions proposed by Mr. Craven, by
                                inserting before the word "ten" the word "five." If these bonds are
                                issued they will undoubtedly become a means of paying taxes, and it
                                would be a convenience to small tax payers to have a denomination as
                                low as five dollars.
                            

                            Mr. STEELE, I shall vote for the reference with the instructions,
                                but, sir, it does seem to me that there is something a little
                                strange about this matter. It seems to me we should act very
                                cautious in this matter. We have fully as many banks as the State
                                can take care of now, and in all probability under the present state
                                of affairs, more than she can take care of. I regard this as simply
                                a banking institution, without any more protection than the present
                                banks have got, and not so much. I was in the Legislature in 1836,
                                at the time these treasury notes were issued, and they had to be
                                repudiated by the State; for I regard that when a State fails to pay
                                her interest for four years, she repudiates her debt. It seems to me
                                we should look as to whether this is the best plan, or whether some
                                other plan may not be best. In the bill proposed to be introduced by
                                the Senator from Wabash [Mr. Conner,] there was a security for the
                                present institutions and the credit of the State. There is no other
                                way to raise this money, it seems to me, only by the credit of the
                                State of Indiana, with coupon bonds in the market. It is our duty as
                                legislators to take care of the institutions we have already
                                authorized, and they have the right to expect that of us. Here is
                                $500,000 of circulation of banks in our State that is based upon
                                foreign bonds. Now should we not come to the relief of those men in
                                some way, in order to keep them from going down? It is known bonds
                                have run down lately, and all the brokers are running home every
                                dollar they can get hold of. You fail to protect the banks under
                                your immediate control, and here you issue a batch of - what will it
                                be in the course of a month alter it is issued? It will be like the
                                issue of 1836. I have bought thousands of it for thirty cents on the
                                dollar. I make this prediction. I hope it will not be so, sir, but I
                                see no way to raise the million or two we have to raise but by
                                keeping the credit of the State firm; issue bonds with coupons
                                attached to them, and Indiana will stand firm and will pay her taxes
                                - as I know our people will do. I do not claim to be a financier par excellence over any body else, but I claim
                                that I have been able to manage my own financial affairs, and I
                                claim I should be entitled to some respect in this matter in that
                                way. In 1836, when the sixteen million issue went over the State,
                                the bonds went down to nothing and almost destroyed the State. The
                                whole people were willing to sell out and get to some State that was
                                not burdened down with taxation. And if it had not been that our
                                bondholders, after the State refused to pay the interest for four
                                years, saw there was no chance only to make a donation, and given us
                                half the real -
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL (interrupting.) I will ask the Senator how much more
                                money it will require to redeem the issue of treasury notes than of
                                coupon bonds?
                            Mr. STEELE. Not any more, sir, but the question is which is the best
                                way to raise it. I take the ground that this committee should be
                                instructed to know whether that would be the best policy - the most
                                economical for the people of the State to pursue in this matter. I
                                agree with the gentleman from Shelby [Mr. Ray] that we ought to look
                                before we leap in this matter. We have financial men that are
                                continually looking out for what is best for them and their
                                institutions, claim to be a little selfish myself, and I also look
                                to the institution I am interested in. But I am as ready to raise
                                every dollar that is absolutely necessary as any other Senator upon
                                this floor. But the question is whether it is the policy of the
                                Legislature of the State of Indiana to do this or not.
                            Mr. WAGNER. I am not prepared to say whether this bill meets my
                                approbation or not, yet I apprehend the Senator from Parke [Mr.
                                Steele] is mistaken in predicting the necessary ruin of the country
                                upon this issue. This is a question to be thought about. I do not
                                presume to say this bill is exactly right, but it may be adopted.
                                You put your obligations in market, and I have no doubt they will
                                sell at what your bonds would sell for, and I have no doubt they
                                will sell for their full face. The State of Indiana putting into
                                market a half million of bonds when her annual taxes are a million -
                                one-half the revenue derived from that source - and yet my friend
                                says they would not sell at par! I don't think the reputation of
                                Indiana would suffer that kind of a disgrace in the market.
                            Mr. RAY (interrupting.) These treasury notes, of course, will be
                                designed to circulate as currency. Now it is not within the
                                convenience or power of one man out of a hundred to hold these notes
                                as they would hold gold or silver; for they are not convertable into
                                anything until 1863. and they would necessarily depreciate and fall
                                in to the hands of capitalists, who would buy them up in the year
                                when they are convertible, at low rates, and they are the men who
                                will be ultimately benefited by the operation.
                            Mr. WAGNER. You put bonds in the market and the broker and the Wall
                                street gambler in stocks buys them, and they are the only men who
                                can buy them. These bonds are not usually redeemable for ten, twenty
                                or forty years, and these notes are redeemable every year, and may
                                be payable in taxes at any time after one year from date. Suppose
                                you raise your taxes twenty-five per cent., which I apprehend you
                                will do, you can pay the half million in money and have a million
                                laying in the treasury. Again, suppose those notes do circulate, and
                                suppose the gentleman from Shelby has a thousand dollars which he
                                wants to invest for the benefit of the State and for his own
                                benefit, I apprehend he would vastly prefer putting it into treasury
                                notes, when he could get gold and silver for it in twelve months
                                after the investment. The faith of the State is pledged for it,
                                because they are made payable in taxes - you are bound to pay it.
                                All they have to do is to go to their county treasury and deposit
                                it, receiving an equivalent of gold and silver. There are men to-day
                                with gold in their hands which they don't want to keep, who would
                                like to invest it at six per cent. interest, Money would be invested
                                in treasury notes if properly issued and they were not cried down by
                                the personal interest of persons who wish to cry them down in order
                                that they may purchase them. There would be an attempt to discredit
                                them at the outset by that class for this very reason. But they
                                would be absolutely safe. One third of the taxes you pay next year
                                would be all the amount we want raised. As the Senator from Fayette
                                     (Mr. Claypool) says, these
                                bonds can not be absolutely cashed immediately, and you want some
                                temporary arrangements. Suppose we go to the bunk and borrow this
                                money, we draw it from the individuals of the State. Instead of
                                increasing the circulation this would decrease it. The Bank of the
                                State would take your obligation for half a million, nay, for five
                                million, if it had the money. I think the people of the entire State
                                will take an interest in it, and every man who has A five dollar
                                bill to spare will invest. I hope it will pass the Legislature and
                                become a law.
                            Mr. LINE offered the following instructions: "Instruct the Committee
                                to inquire whether it will be necessary to incorporate in a bill a
                                provision for punishing persons who may counterfeit the bonds, or
                                whether the general law on counterfeiting will cover the case.
                            Mr. March's motion to amend the instructions of Mr. Craven by
                                inserting therein the word "five" before the word "ten," was then
                                agreed to.
                            Mr. LINE offered the following additional instructions: " Instruct
                                the Committee to inquire whether the means proposed in the bill is
                                the most feasible one to make a loan, or whether some other plan, or
                                any other one, would be more preferable for the State and the
                                tax-payers thereof."
                            The bill and pending instructions were referred to the
                                    Committee on Finance.
                            On motion by Mr. JONES, it was -
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee

                                            early day what amount of the expense of the present war
                                            preparations will have to be provided for by the State
                                            of Indiana, and what part will properly fall upon the
                                            General Government.

                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Finance be instructed to inquire into
                                            the expediency of levying an additional tax for the year
                                            of 1861. for the purpose of paying the interest upon the
                                            bonds of the State that may be sold for the purpose of
                                            raising money to defray the expenses of The State, and
                                            that such additional tax be placed upon the tax
                                            duplicate for the present year, and report to this

                                order, it was read the second time, and referred to the

                                Assembly," and insert in lieu thereof the words "members of the
                                Senate."
                            On motion by Mr. BEESON, the bill and amendments were laid on the

                                the same subject, returned the same with the recommendation that the

                                            adjourn on Friday, the 3d day of May to re-assemble on
                                            Tuesday the 21st day of May, and that the members shall
                                            not receive any per diem (or pay) during the
                                            adjournment," be amended as follows: Strike out the
                                            "21st" where it occurs and insert "16th." Add to the
                                            resolution the following words"but shall be entitled to
                                            mileage," and when so amended, the committee recommend
                                            its passage.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. CONNER. The committee thought it best to change the House
                                resolution, and that would leave us sixteen days of the special
                                session that we could use. The resolution of the House contemplated
                                the reassembling of the Legislature on the 21st, but the committee
                                supposed that we should meet earlier, and if legislation did not
                                keep us, we could adjourn before the forty days were up. The House
                                resolution provides that no per diem should be
                                allowed during the recess, but so far as I can learn from
                                conversation with members, they think it proper to allow
                                mileage.
                            Mr. WOLFE. I would suggest to the gentleman from Wabash that the
                                report ought to be corrected in one particular. He ought to strike
                                out the words "Tuesday, the 21st," from the resolution, and insert
                                the words "Thursday the 16th," which is a mere clerical mistake.
                            Mr. CONNER. Certainly, certainly, that ought to be done.
                            The suggestion was agreed to by consent, and the report was concurred
                                in.
                            Mr. WAGNER. In anticipation of this matter I have made such inquiries
                                as it was possible for me to make, and I understand the
                                appropriation bills, the supply and other bills are pending in the
                                House. It may be possible to adjourn on Friday, but I apprehend it
                                is hardly probable, from the number of bills I see imperfected -
                                some of which are yet to be framed and written, I would suggest that
                                the subject be laid over until to-morrow at this time, or Friday
                                forenoon.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER, (interrupting) I would suggest that if we can not get
                                through, we can rescind the resolution.
                            Mr. WAGNER. From the time the resolution is adopted we will probably
                                be without a quorum - I don't suppose there is a quorum here now. I
                                made the suggestion simply, but in order to test the sense of the
                                Senate, I move to postpone the matter till Friday, 10 o'clock.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON. I hope that will not be done. It is a resolution of the
                                House we are about to pass. We propose to adjourn on the day they
                                fixed, and I hope the Senate will agree to it. They understand their
                                business, and would not pass the resolution unless they thought they
                                could meet it. Bills can be passed and go to the Governor, just as
                                well as though we staid here, because the session will be a
                                continuous one.
                            Mr. LINE. Senators will recollect that this is a proposition coming
                                from the House, and if the Senate concur it will pass with the
                                amendment of the committee, hence it will have to go back to the
                                House and they must be their own judges as to whether they adjourn
                                on Friday or not. I hope it will pass the Senate and go to the House
                                and let them be the judges.
                            The motion to postpone was rejected.
                            The resolution, as amended, was then adopted.
                            Mr. ANTHONY introduced a bill [18] identical with the bill H. R. 21,
                                entitled "An act for  the
                                organization and regulation of the Indiana militia, prescribing
                                penalties for violations of said regulations, and repealing all laws
                                heretofore enacted on that subject." Which was read the first
                                time.
                            Mr. MURRAY asked and obtained leave of absence for the remainder of
                                the session. He is a private in one of the volunteer companies from
                                his county, which have received marching orders, and it was
                                necessary for him to return home before leaving with the army.
                            Mr. MILLER asked and obtained leave of absence for Mr. DeHart till
                                Tuesday - he being called away by pressing business engagements.
                            And then the Senate adjourned.
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            WEDNESDAY, May 1, 1861.
                        
                        On motion by Mr. HAYS, the reading of the journal was dispensed with.
                        
                            HOSPITAL FOR THE INSANE.
                            Mr. KENDRICK, from the Committee on Benevolent
                                    Institutions, to which was referred the communication
                                of the officers of the Indiana Hospital for the Insane, reported a
                                recommendation for an additional appropriation of $2,700 for repairs
                                and supplies of said institution. He explained the recommendation of
                                the committee, and set forth, in its specific objects of repairs of
                                the roof of the building, and the supply of bedding, coal, &c.,
                                the necessity of the appropriation.
                            On motion by Mr. NEBEKER, the report was recommitted to the same
                                committee, with instructions to report a bill in conformity
                                therewith.
                        
                        
                            RELIEF BILLS.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS introduced a bill (27) providing for relief by valuation
                                and appraisement, from execution and judgment upon all contracts
                                hereafter made.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG introduced a bill (28) providing for the redemption of real property sold
                                upon execution within this State: [defendant may redeem the same any
                                time within one year, by paying the purchase-money with 10 per cent,
                                interest - the purchaser to be entitled to the growing crop,
                                &c.]
                            These bills were severally passed to the second reacting.
                        
                        
                            CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATIONS.
                             Mr. LANE. Mr. Speaker, I move a reconsideration of the vote of
                                yesterday adopting the joint resolution from the Senate, No. 3,
                                drawn by Senator Steele. I am satisfied that there is a good deal of
                                buncomb in those resolutions; and I think there are some things in
                                them calculated to irritate rather than allay any ill feeling the
                                Kentucky people may hold against us. These resolutions are not
                                addressed to the Governor of Kentucky, for he is understood to be a
                                secessionist. What then do we mean in those resolutions when we say
                                that when a dozen Union-loving men shall call upon us, we will go
                                over in little squads and help them there against the secessionists?
                                Such a declaration as that would do more to irritate the people of
                                Kentucky against us than anything that could possibly be done here.
                                I move the reconsideration in order that for the present we may lay
                                the resolution on the table. I think they should be better
                                matured.
                            Mr, STOTSENBERG. What section of the resolution does the gentleman
                                from Putnam desire to consider again?
                            Mr. LANE. The latter part of the last (the third) resolution.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. Does he not consider it the duty of all loyal men to
                                defend Union men in the State of Kentucky, or in any other
                                State?
                            Mr. LANE. It seems to me that we should wait to be called upon for
                                that purpose by the proper authorities - that we should not, as
                                individuals, go over there with arms to help them.
                            Mr. DOBBINS. I hope the House will not reconsider that vote. These
                                resolutions under, went mature deliberation in the Senate. I
                                happened to be there at the time of the vote on them, and I saw that
                                they gave them very careful attention. I think, sir, that it is
                                nothing more than right and proper that we should do everything in
                                our power to sustain the Union men in Kentucky or any other State -
                                no matter which - even in the extreme South If we find men
                                struggling against rebellion, it is our duty to say to them, we are
                                ready to stand by you in the defence of our government and our
                                common rights; to let them know that the State of Indiana, while she
                                is firm in maintaining the Union, is determined also to be just -
                                determined not to make war on the institution of slavery. These
                                resolutions express this: that every patriotic citizen of the State
                                of Indiana is determined to maintain the Union for the love he has
                                for the Union, and not for his hatred of the South, and the slavery
                                of the South. I regard the man going into war now to express his
                                hatred of the South as not a true Union man - as guilty, in fact, of
                                moral treason against the Union We all engage in this strife for the
                                love we bear toward our Union and its government, as our fathers
                                made it, and not on account of sectional hatred. I trust the House
                                will not reconsider the vote.
                            Mr. PARRETT. Mr. Speaker, in regard to this resolution, I agree with
                                the gentleman from Martin, (Mr. Dobbins,) and disagree with the
                                gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Lane.) In the first blush it struck me
                                that the resolutions were unnecessary, because they are the same in
                                tone and sentiment that have been promulgated in this House, more
                                than fifty times during the last session and the present. There is
                                no objections to urge against them, except in one portion where we
                                speak of assisting the Kentuckians. I suppose there can be no
                                objection to that branch of the joint resolution, which says we are
                                opposed to interference with their peculiar institution. Nobody
                                complains of that section. There is no complaint about that part
                                which says we are at all times ready to assist Union men against
                                traitors. The language used in regard to assisting Kentuckians is
                                simply being a little more specific in regard to the State of
                                Kentucky than any other State; and I say that is proper and right.
                                The state of Kentucky lies contiguous to us. We are nearer to her
                                people than to the people of any other State now proposing to
                                overthrow the Government of the United States; and any language  speaking more tenderly from
                                this place for Kentuckians is not out of place at this time. I say
                                this - I am opposed to all traitors and all rebels every where. And
                                if a man up north is so desirous of carrying out his own abstract
                                views and feelings for the overthrow of slavery that he will rise up
                                and join a party for the overthrow of this government, I would fight
                                him as soon as any other traitor. Then why reconsider that vote? The
                                vote is right, and it is useless to spend time upon it. This we have
                                announced by it; it has been announced by the people, from every
                                stump in the State, and will be so announced as long as men are
                                found in the State to stand up for the Constitution and laws,
                                Instead of reconsidering it, I would rather vote upon it again.
                                [Applause.] Gentlemen sometimes talk about bowing down to men. Sir,
                                I will get on my knees to any man who loves the government well
                                enough to fight for it. I am one not afraid to get down. In my town
                                the other day, when they were talking about who was to blame for
                                this exigency, I told them to put the whole blame upon me; that I
                                would bear it; that this was no time to find fault, but to fight.
                                Let us fight for our country and its institutions. Such was the
                                feeling among us up there, and I pity the man who feels other wise.
                                I don't believe that the gentleman from Putnam feels otherwise than
                                I do. I think when we come to understand each other we will be found
                                about of the same mind. These men, sir, these Union men we will
                                assist when we can, that is when we are authorized to do so - when
                                we are called upon by the proper authorities.
                            Mr. ROBERTS. I have but a word to say in in regard to the
                                motion of the gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Lane) to reconsider. The
                                resolutions which were gotten up in the Senate, and reported - to
                                and approved by this House, on yesterday, are nothing but buncomb!
                                They are a well-studied dodge from the beginning to the end. In no
                                case do they come squarely up to the crisis. It is true, sir, that
                                in times of peace and quiet they would do well enough. The
                                sentiments they express are correct. But, sir, I repeat that they do
                                not meet the exigencies of the case, and therefore are
                                worthless.
                            Mr. Speaker, our country is in a state of civil war and rebellion.
                                Traitors have been and are now conspiring to break up the
                                Government. They are now marshaling their armies upon our Southern
                                coast, with the avowed purpose of seizing on the Federal Capitol,
                                and overthrowing the constituted authorities of the country. For
                                these acts of treason and rebellion they have no excuse. None at
                                all, sir, as against the General Government. This rebellion has
                                become formidable, so much so that it has become the duty - the bounden duty - of the Administration at
                                Washington to call upon the military power of the country - the people - to put down these insurrectionary
                                proceedings, it not being in the power of the Government to do so in
                                the ordinary way. Sir, the people have responded to that call in a
                                manner unparalleled in the history of any country, and I believe it
                                to be the duty of this body to do so also, in such terms that we
                                cannot be misunderstood. The Senate resolutions do not do this. They
                                fall far short of it. What we desire to accomplish, by the
                                reconsideration, is, to meet the case fully.
                            Now, sir, a word in regard to Kentucky, as she has been referred to
                                by gentlemen who have preceded me. I have no objection to extending
                                the right hand of fellowship to the Union men of Kentucky. I believe
                                there are hundreds of loyal men in that brave, old State. But, while
                                many of her sous are true to the Union, the official power of that
                                State occupy a hostile position to the Government. The Governor of
                                that State has refused, in very insolent terms, to respond to the
                                call of the President affirmatively, but still desires us to
                                understand that Kentucky occupies, as between the rebellionists and
                                the Government, neutral gronud - aye, more - armed neutrality! Sir, in my judgment the official
                                power of that State occupies a more dangerous position to the
                                Government than even South Carolina. Armed neutrality! Think of it!
                                Sir, such a position as that, at a time like this, is utterly
                                impossible. If Kentucky is for the Government, let her say so, and
                                then we will understand her. But she is now, through the official
                                power of the State, acting as a kind of break-water between South
                                Carolina and the Government, showing all the while an easy hand to
                                that rebel State, while she is giving no compact to the authorities
                                at Washington. This will not do. But, sir, I hope the people of
                                ''Old Kentuck" will take the matter in their own hands and place
                                their State right on the record. There are strong ties which bind us
                                to Kentucky, and we do not want them severed. Let her, then, declare
                                herself for the Union, and Indiana will stand by her to the death.
                                Toward Kentucky we will entertain no other feeling than that of
                                brotherly love, so long as she remains true to us and the Union.
                            Mr. FRASIER. I shall vote for reconsideration. I consider those
                                resolutions as loosely drawn and full of buncombe. What do I care
                                about the men of Kentucky coming over here to defend the wives and
                                daughters of former times? That was all right in its time. This
                                House passed a resolution early in the session, which satisfied my
                                mind. It was very short - not more than half a dozen lines long; But
                                the Senate very coolly laid that on the table and sent these
                                resolutions back to us. They are full of obscurity, and it is
                                manifest that gentlemen here have not yet been able to find out
                                their meaning.
                            Mr. NEWMAN. It seems to me there is inconsistency in the meaning of
                                that joint resolution, if there is any meaning in it at all. I see
                                here in the first resolution-
                            The SPEAKER, (Mr. McLean in the chair.) The Chair would inform the
                                gentleman that the printed resolution to which he refers is not in
                                the engrossed copy.
                            Several voices. "Read the resolution."
                            The engrossed resolutions were then read by the Clerk.
                            Mr. NEWMAN resumed. The printed copy of the first resolution states
                                about all that we want. It states the position as I conceive of the
                                people of Indiana. But the other resolutions seem to repudiate the
                                first. In the present difficulties it is plainly our duty and the
                                duty of all loyal States to repudiate those States that repudiate
                                the General Government. Kentucky has  repudiated the General Government and
                                so places herself before us as an enemy. Now it seems to me that a
                                State repudiating the Federal Constitution by assuming a neutral
                                position is a more dangerous enemy than one that comes out openly in
                                opppsition, It gives them an opportunity to cover up their war
                                schemes, under the plea that they are still in the Union. It is only
                                when they come out boldly that we know how to treat them. Kentucky
                                has placed hereself in that position. No doubt there are hundreds
                                and thousands of loyal men in Kentucky who are willing to make any
                                sacrifice for the Union; and so I believe there are in the Southern
                                States; but we must deal with facts as they exist. We must deal with
                                the authorities of those States. If they have bad rulers upon
                                themselves must rest the consequences. This is the only way we can
                                deal with States; therefore, we must deal with Kentucky as an enemy
                                to the Federal Government. As for the expression of sympathy with
                                Union men in all the States, I think it is right to do so. I will do
                                everything I can to encourage them. But I am unwilling that they
                                shall get any advantage of us by assuming that they are Union men,
                                and then when they get all the advantage of us they can, throw off
                                the cloak. I have been credibly informed of Kentucky, that the
                                moment she gets what advantage she can from her neutrality, the
                                first fire she will make will be at this Union. I have been told
                                that the late appointment suggested by the Governor of Kentucky, of
                                Governors to come together and see if something could not be done
                                for conciliation was not attended by Gov. Magoffin himself.
                            A VOICE. He sent an irresposible man in his place.
                            Mr. NEWMAN. Gov. Magoffin failed to fulfil his own appointment whilst
                                our Governor and the Governor of Ohio attended promptly. This shows
                                the hollow heartedness of their professions. Gentlemen had said here
                                that they have relatives in Kentucky. So have I - relatives
                                scattered all over the Southern States. But I look upon this matter
                                in this light. If it should come to pass with us that we should meet
                                in opposing ranks on the field of contest for and against the Union,
                                the consequences must rest upon them. I could have no more good
                                feeling for any relative of mine engaged in an attempt to overthrow
                                the best government in the world, than for any other person engaged
                                in the same business. Hardly so much: for I feel that they all ought
                                to know better. Looking upon the resolutions in this light, sir,
                                they amount to nothing in my judgment; and I think there is no use
                                in wasting words about them. Let us take a bold and decided stand,
                                and press this matter to a consummation.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. The gentleman from Wayne, [Mr. Newman,] has taken
                                special pains to setup a man of straw and knock it down again. He
                                has based his argument upon a section that is not in the joint
                                resolution. Sir, what are we called upon to do with respect to this
                                question of an armed neutrality in Kentucky. I am informed by the
                                votes of 84 men on this floor, voting for this resolution,
                                yesterday, that they all "have the utmost confidence in the
                                patriotism of Kentucky." The resolution passed unanimously - the
                                gentleman from Dearborn, [Mr. Roberts] and the gentleman from Wayne
                                voted for it: I think ought not to be ashamed of it. This
                                resolution, sir, states the true position that ought be taken by
                                every individual and every State this Union. Why are we bound to
                                assume that Kentuckians are all traitors, and engaged in armed
                                rebellion against the Government?
                            Mr. ROBERTS interposing. I did not say people of Kentucky, but their
                                official power.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. Why can't we wait? Why can't we suspend our judgment
                                till Legislature of Kentucky shall convenene Monday? Why can't we
                                wait till they decide for themselves that they do not wish to uphold
                                the Constitution and laws? Is it because treason on able words have
                                been uttered in Kentucky either by the Governor or somebody else? Is
                                that a sufficient reason for us to declare ourselves ready to fight
                                her to-morrow? The gentleman says we must take a bold stand. Must
                                we, because there are secessionists in Kentucky, forth-with declare
                                that State in rebellion, and just march our forces over the river
                                and put her down? No, sir; so long as Kentuckians are citizens of
                                the United States - so long as they subscribe to the sentiment that
                                we have a Constitution and laws made in pursuance thereof which must
                                be maintained and enforced - so long as they maintain that position,
                                the gentleman and we all are bound to stand up to this resolution we
                                have passed. So long as there are ten men in Kentucky who stand up
                                for the Union, we are bound to rally to their aid and protect them
                                against traitors, come from whatever quarter they may. Sir, if it
                                were necessary, we are called upon by our duty as citizens to
                                sustain the Union men in South Carolina. Let us be ready, then at
                                the proper time, to go into Kentucky or anywhere, for the
                                preservation of the Union and the protection of Union men. That is
                                what the resolution contemplates. It does not say we shall go there
                                as a mob; that we shall march across in; Kentucky unauthorized by
                                the proper authorities, But when the proclamation comes for us to
                                rail for the protection of the sons and daughters of those who stood
                                by our Fathers in former times, then we should be ready. Then let us
                                not precipital matters. So far as business interests are concerned
                                all Kentuckians are for the Union, as far as I know. We are bound to
                                believe the people of Kentucky are for the Union, no matter what
                                their Governor may say. Sir, it you want to presuppose and say
                                Kentucky is out of the Union, then reconsider this resolution and do
                                it. But I counsel that, until Kentucky declares herself unmistakably
                                out of the Union, we had better give our aid and countenance to her
                                Union men. Sir, I wish you could hear these Kentuckians talk, as I
                                have heard them. How they do talk to us! I have been moved when they
                                addressed almost in tones of anguish: "What shall we do?" they say.
                                "We are fighting the secession element: can you help us? We know you
                                can't come over with your troops, but you can come to us with your
                                sympathies. We can fight it down, if you do not precipitate a war."
                                I have said them in reply, (and I hope the General Assembly will not
                                falsify my words,) that we will stand by our friends in Kentucky and
                                help them to fight  secession,
                                with all the influences and means in our power.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN, (Mr. Bundy in the chair.) I do not propose to
                                consider the status of Kentucky, as to whether she
                                is loyal or not; but I shall inquire what is the status of Indiana? I can not think gentlemen have read
                                these resolutions carefully; for if they had, it seems to me that
                                the gentleman from Floyd and others, would not oppose their
                                reconsideration. What does this third resolution propose? It
                                proposes that the people of Indiana, not in pursuance of law, not in
                                obedience to the order of the President of the United States, shall
                                march into Kentucky and assist the Union men. This third resolution
                                proposes that we pledge the State of Indiana, in defiance of legal
                                authority, in defiance of the Constitution of the United States and
                                of this State, to march her forces into Kentucky, whenever called
                                upon by Kentucky herself. * * * What right have we to pledge that
                                the forces of the State of Indiana shall go out of the State without
                                first being required by the President of the United States? Have we
                                any power, but upon the requisition of the President of the United
                                States, to call out the militia of the State? Have we any
                                constitutional right to pledge the forces of Indiana to be marched
                                into Kentucky upon the call of the Legislature of of the
                                Executive of Kentucky? I call the attention of the House to the
                                following language of the third resolution: "We stand ready at the
                                call of Kentucky to aid them as brothers." Not at the call of the
                                President; not in pursuance of the Constitution of the United States
                                or of this State, but in violation and disregard of all. Why sir, we
                                place ourselves in the attitude of rebellion against the Government
                                of the United States, and I apprehend that there is no member on
                                this floor desirous of placing himself in this attitude.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. If the Secessionists were murdering the Kentuckians,
                                would it not be our duty to go and protect them?
                            Mr. ALLEN. It would be our duty to go, as citizens of Indiana, but
                                not by State authority. I ask the gentleman if it would be in our
                                power to go as a State?
                            Mr. SIOTSENBERG. As individuals, it would be our duty to go; but as a
                                State, we should wait for the authority of the General
                                Government.
                            Mr. ALLEN. Then does not this resolution pledge the State to go at
                                the call of Kentucky? "And we stand ready at the call of Kentucky to
                                aid them as brothers." * * * I am not willing that this State shall
                                pledge her whole force and strength to the State of Kentucky or any
                                other State, for the simple reason that she has neither the legal
                                nor the constitutional power to do so. I stand opposed to that
                                principle I trust the vote will be reconsidered, and that this
                                matter will be referred to a committee. Let it be properly matured,
                                and let nothing go forth from this body that will show a disposition
                                on the par of the State of Indiana to violate the Federal
                                compact.
                            Mr. WOODHALL said there seemed to be too much effort here to make
                                expression by resolution. We had been called here to prepare our
                                selves to respond to the President of the Unites States. He regarded
                                it as our duty simply to pass the needed bills, and then to declare
                                our loyalty through the loud-mouthed cannon, and through
                                strong-armed men on the tented field.
                            Mr PACKARD. The resolutions were to submit an answer to the question
                                whether this was to be a war of aggression on the institution of
                                slavery. The opposition to them then must come from those who would
                                prosecute the war as as an aggression upon the slavery of
                                the South.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Bartholomew, was willing to see the resolution amended
                                in one particular, and could for that purpose be willing to
                                reconsider.
                            Mr. CRAIN should vote for the reconsiders-ion. This was not to say he
                                was opposed to every sentiment in the resolutions. If we pledge he
                                military force of the State, it should be done n a constitutional
                                way.
                            MR. ROBBINS. The gentleman from Allen was fearful that there was a
                                constitutional difficulty in the third resolution. He would read the
                                - first resolution, and qualify the last by that. The qualification
                                of readiness to aid was under the authority of the Constitution of
                                the United States. He opposed the motion to reconsider.
                            Mr. HOLCOMB demanded the previous question and there was a
                                second.
                            The yeas and nays being demanded and taken on the main question, viz:
                                Shall the vote be reconsidered? The result was - yeas 51, nays 32 -
                                as follows:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        AYES - Messrs. Anderson, Brucker, Bryan, Bundy, Campbell,

                                            51.
                                        NOES - Messrs. Atkinson, Black, Brett, Chapman, Combs,

                                            Trier, and Warrum - 32.
                                    
                                
                            
                            So the vote adopting the joint resolution was reconsidered.
                            >Mr. MeLEAN rose and moved that the joint resolution be referred
                                to a select committee of five.
                            Mr. ORR moved ineffectually to refer it to the Committee on
                                    Federal Relations.
                            And then they were referred to a select committee, namely: Messrs.
                                McLean, Crain, Heffren, Newman and Bundy.
                        
                        
                            TWO MILLION LOAN.
                            Mr. McLEAN, from the Committee on Ways and Means,
                                returned Mr. Fisher's loan bill [22] with amendments, viz:
                            Amend the first section by filling the blank so as to authorise the
                                Governor to issue the bonds of the State to the amount of two
                                millions of dollars, and insert appropriately these words: "And of
                                the said issue of two millions, five hundred thousand shall be in
                                bonds of $500, and the residue in bonds of $1,000." And inserting as
                                one of the Loan Commissioners, the name of John H. O'Boyle in the
                                place of Allen Hamilton.
                            Mr. FISHER. The original bill provided for the issuing of the bonds
                                of one thousand dollar denomination - all of them. The committee
                                generally were of the opinion that a portion of these bonds had
                                better be of the denomination of five hundred dollars. That change
                                made the other amendments necessary. The real question  to be determined upon the proposed
                                amendments is, whether we shall issue part of the bonds for five
                                hundred dollars or all of them for a thousand dollars each. The
                                reason of the change striking out the name of Allen Hamilton, was
                                because he is ineligible. He holds the place of a member of the
                                General Assembly; and the Constitution reads that no Senator or
                                Representative shall be eligible to hold any office created during
                                the time he was a member of the Legislature. But the only question
                                is about the five hundred dollar bonds. I am still compelled to
                                differ with the committee. I am of opinion they should all be
                                thousand dollar bonds. As the matter of filling the blank with "two
                                millions" perhaps it would have been better at present to have
                                continued that in blank till we shall have a report from the
                                    Military Committee. The amount may be too
                                much or too little - that depends upon the action of the General
                                Assembly. If we pass the six regiment bill it will be too little; if
                                we do not it will be perhaps too much. We have already appropriated
                                five hundred thousand dollars for arms, which, with the Governor's
                                contingent fund included, is six hundred thousand dollars. It is
                                contemplated that this loan shall cover these appropriations and all
                                others made during the session. There is also provision for levying
                                a tax of five cents on the hundred dollars, to pay the interest on
                                this loan, and to provide a sinking fund for the payment of the
                                principal. That levy according to the assessment, will raise two him
                                hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year. The amount required to
                                pay the interest will be one hundred and twenty thousand dollars,
                                leaving the rest to go into the sinking fund for the redemption of
                                the principal.
                            Mr. CRAIN. A portion of the committee thought that under all the
                                circumstances, it might be a better policy to issue some of'the
                                bonds of a lower denomination, in order that they might be taken by
                                citizens of our own State. It may be that our people, farmers and
                                others, who de sire to loan money, would prefer to loan it in this
                                direction, because of the advantage of exchange and of the exemption
                                from taxation - which would make such an investment two per cent,
                                better than an ordinary loan. For this reason I have thought it best
                                to have a portion of the bonds of the denomination of five hundred
                                dollars.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. We understood the gentleman from Parke to say that
                                whoever holds these bonds, would not be taxed upon them.
                            Mr. CRAIN. There is nothing in the bill to that effect. I believe
                                State stocks are not taxed.
                            Mr. FISHER and Mr. HEFFREN. The gentleman is mistaken.
                            Mr. CRAIN. There is a provision in the bill which provides that these
                                bonds shall not be put into market, except as the exigencies of the
                                case may require.
                            The report was then concurred in, the amendments adopted, and so the
                                bill was ordered to be engrossed.
                            Mr. PARRETT. Would it not be well to make the amount of the loan in
                                the bill, blank for the present?
                            Mr. McLEAN. No more bonds will be issued than the necessities of the
                                State shall require.
                        
                        
                            EXPENSES OF THE WAR PREPARATION.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Bartholomew, submitted following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the committee
                                                on Ways and Means inquire into the
                                            probable expense of the present war preparations - what
                                            portion thereof will have to be paid by the State of
                                            Indiana, and what by the General Government, and report
                                            at an early day.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. FOSTER said the House had all the data. It depended on the
                                passage of the six regiment bill.
                            Mr. BUNDY. It was impossible to divide the military expense between
                                the State and General Government.
                            Mr. SMITH withdrew his resolution.
                            Mr. FISHER introduced a bill [29] to amen the 9th section of the act
                                entitled an act to authorize and regulate the business of general
                                banking, passed March 3, 1858, which was passed to the second
                                reading.
                            On motion of Mr. FISHER, (the rules being suspended for the purpose,)
                                the bill was read the second time and referred to the
                                    Committee on Banks.
                            Mr. BUNDY proposed an amendment, viz: "Provided said protested bills
                                may be redeemed at any time before the sale of such stocks;" which
                                went along with the bill with the same amendment.
                            Mr. HOLCOMB submitted the following, which was adopted.
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That a committee of three be
                                            appointed to investigate the report of the volunteer
                                            companies to the Adjutant General's office, and report
                                            to this House the order in which such reports were
                                            made.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Whereupon the SPEAKER appointed said committee, namely: Messrs.
                                Holcomb, Hopkins and Chapman.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            Mr. JENKINSON, by unanimous consent, submitted a resolution for a
                                board of medical examination of not less than five, to be appointed
                                by the Governor, to examine applicants for places of surgeon and
                                assistant surgeon in the sixth regiment - prescribing that no person
                                shall be examined as an applicant for surgeon unless he has been a
                                regular practitioner for ten years, and none for assistant surgeon
                                unless he shall have been a practitioner for five years.
                            Mr. ROBERTS stated that the Governor had informed him that these
                                appointments were all made.
                            Mr. JENKINSON then withdrew the resolution.

                            
                                STOCK BANK SECURITIES.
                                Mr. FISHER, from the Committee on Banks,
                                    returned his bill [29] to amend the ninth section, of the
                                    general banking law, with amendments, to-wit: strike out section
                                    9 after the words "Auditor of State," and insert "whenever in
                                    the opinion of the Governor, Treasurer and Secretary of State it
                                    shall be deemed advisable, having in view the condition of the
                                    market."
                                He said in the original bill it was provided that in case of
                                    protested notes the Auditor shall proceed upon the securities
                                    within one year, and not until the end of six months to make
                                    payment. The amendment leaves it discretionary with the
                                    Governor, Treasurer and Secretary of State, at any time, to sell
                                    the securities, having in view  the bond market, and still
                                    requiring it to be done within the year. But within that time
                                    they may sell the stock and redeem the notes at discretion.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON. Is that bill designed to legalize bank
                                    suspensions?
                                Mr. FISHER. No sir; the object is merely this: There are five or
                                    six hundred thousand dollars of Indiana State bonds in the stock
                                    banks. It is possible that some banks, banking on these stocks,
                                    may be protested in such times as these, and the object is to
                                    give a discretion to the Governor as to the time when these
                                    bonds shall be put into the market. If injudiciously thrust upon
                                    the market it might have the effect of depreciating their value;
                                    for example he may not probably put them into the market until
                                    after the coupon bonds of the State hereafter to be issued maybe
                                    negotiated.
                                Mr. GRAIN. It is not for the benefit of the banks but of the
                                    bill-holders.
                                Mr. FISHER. The original prohibited sales of stocks till after
                                    six months. The committee thought also, that, on account of the
                                    failing character of Southern seceding States stocks, it might
                                    be desirable to sell such stocks sooner than six months.
                                Mr. RAGAN. As this was an important bill, he would move that it
                                    lie on the table and be printed.
                                Mr. CRAIN. There is but just one thing in the bill - barely one
                                    section - as explained.
                                Mr. RAGAN could not scrutinize the bill without having it before
                                    him.
                                Mr. FRASIER. Any man could understand' the difference between not
                                    selling till the end of six months, and selling sooner, at the
                                    discretion of the State officers.
                                The report of the committee was concurred in, and the amendments'
                                    were adopted.
                                On motion by Mr. FISHER, the bill was ordered to be
                                    engrossed.
                            
                            
                                VOLUNTEER FAMILY AID.
                                Mr. VEATCH, from the Judiciary Committee,
                                    returned the volunteer family aid bill [S. 6] recommending its
                                    passage. He stated that there was a House bill transmitted with
                                    better provisions in some respects, which it was probable would
                                    pass. All he asked was that the report be concurred in, and that
                                    the bill be left on the files tor the present.
                                The report was concurred in.
                            
                            
                                THE $25,000 BILL.
                                Mr. VEATCH, from the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary, returned the Auditor's deposit bill,
                                    [S. 12] recommending its passage.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG inquired how this $25,000 was to be paid?
                                Mr. FISHER. Out of the Governor's contingent fund. But to make it
                                    sure he asked, unanimous consent to put such a clause into the
                                    bill.
                                And then the bill, as thus amended, was passed to the final
                                    reading in the House of Representatives - yeas 69, nays 0.
                            
                            
                                ADJOURNMENT TO A DAY CERTAIN.
                                On motion of Mr. BUNDY, the House took up the Senate amendment to
                                    Mr. McLean's concurrent resolution to adjourn the session from
                                    next Friday till Tuesday the 21st inst., viz.: shortening the
                                    recess till Thursday, the 16th inst., and adding mileage.
                                The question being shall the House concur? -
                                The SPEAKER said: The military bill has not yet been disposed of,
                                    nor the treason bill, nor the six regiment bill. These and
                                    almost every other important bill remain undisposed of. It does
                                    seem to the Chair that we had better remain here a few days and
                                    dispose of some of these important measures than go home and
                                    when we return have to begin anew. On Monday next the Kentucky
                                    Legislature, meets. That makes another necessity for us to
                                    remain in session, to see what is to be the action of that body
                                    upon the recommendation of Gov. Magoffin.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG concurred in the view of the Chair.
                                Mr. HOLCOMB submitted considerations in favor of the proposed
                                    recess.
                                Mr. FORD said it would require all the time till Friday night to
                                    consider two important bills before the body.
                                Messrs. SMITH of Bartholomew, ORR, FRASIER and VEATCH gave their
                                    views; and then -
                                On motion of Mr. Speaker ALLEN, [Mr. Lane in the chair] the
                                    resolution and engrossed amendment were laid on the table -
                                    affirmative 38, negative 37.
                            
                            
                                EXECUTIVE EXEMPTION.
                                Mr. VEATCH, from the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary, returned Mr. Hoicomb's resolution for
                                    an act to exempt the property of volunteers from sale or
                                    execution during their term of service, and reported the opinion
                                    that such an act would conflict with the constitution,and that
                                    the object could not be gained without passing a general law for
                                    exemption from execution that shall operate on all alike; so the
                                    committee submitted the matter for the consideration of the
                                    House.
                                The report was concurred in.
                            
                            
                                THE SIX REGIMENT BILL.
                                Mr. HEFFREN, from the Committee on Military
                                        Affairs, returned the six regiment bill [S. 1]
                                    with amendments, to-wit: In the first section strike out "six"
                                    and insert "seven" regiments. Insert appropriately, "the seventh
                                    regiment to be cavalry, and to be organized as hereinafter
                                    provided." Strike out "Lieutenant and Ensign," and insert "First
                                    and Second Lieutenants." Strike out "twelve months" and insert
                                    "three years." Insert appropriately, "that in the organization
                                    of said regiments preference shall be given to such counties as
                                    have not yet furnished men under the proclamation of the
                                    Governor." Add to section six to the effect that one of which
                                    regiments shall be cavalry; said regiment to consist of ten
                                    companies of fifty nine men each, rank and file. The cavalry
                                    shall not be mounted unless called into the service of the
                                    General Government or the exigencies of the State shall require
                                    it. The cavalry shall be enlisted for and during the war, and
                                    shall be selected in the order in which services have been
                                    offered.
                                Mr. HEFFREN. In the first place the committee agree to change the
                                    term of service. The Senate bill proposed the term of twelve
                                    months. The last call is for six regiments, to. serve three
                                    years, unless sooner discharged. "We have the bill to conform to
                                    that. The other  amendment
                                    is authorizing seven regiments instead of sixs - ix regiments to
                                    be composed of artillery and infantry and the seventh of cavalry
                                    - the cavalry to be enlisted for and during the war; their
                                    companies to consist of fifty-nine men each. The other amendment
                                    is to give those counties the preference which have not been
                                    able to get their men in under the first requisition. We provide
                                    also that the six regiments shall be divided into artillery and
                                    infantry, as the service may demand, and otherwise we make the
                                    bill conform to the regulations of the army of the United States
                                    in the matter of officering the companies. In section 3 we allow
                                    the Brigadier General to appoint his own staff, and we make no
                                    distinction between officers and men in regard to pay.
                                Mr. CASON moved that the bill and amendments lie on the table,
                                    and that 200 copies thereof be printed for the use of the
                                    House.
                                Mr. HEFFREN had no objection to lay the bill on the table, and
                                    make it the special order to-morrow morning. He referred to the
                                    amount of labor on the part of the committee to prepare the bill
                                    H. R. No. 21, which would probably supersede this.
                                Mr. CASON. The bill should be fully considered before voting.
                                Mr. ORR and Mr. SMITH of Bartholomew concurred with the gentleman
                                    from Boone.
                                Mr. PARRETT counselled to proceed cautiously. Perhaps both these
                                    bills would yet be superseded by a new bill, after we shall see
                                    the Governor's proclamation which will be in the papers
                                    to-morrow.
                                Mr. GRESHAM. It might be wisest to pass Over this bill
                                    altogether, and allow the enlistment for the six regiments to be
                                    made directly into the service of the United States.
                                Mr. Cason's motion to print was now agreed to, and the Speaker
                                    appointed that gentleman a committee to see that the said
                                    printing be done as soon as may be.
                                Mr. KENDRICK, (by leave,) introduced a bill [30] ranking
                                    appropriations [$2,700] for the Indiana Hospital for the Insane,
                                    which was passed to the second reading.
                            
                            
                                ORGANIZATION OF THE MILITIA.
                                On the motion of Mr. GRESHAM, the committee's militia bill was
                                    taken up and considered by sections.
                                Pending the consideration thereof -
                                The House adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            THURSDAY, May 2, 1861.
                        
                        Mr. MELLETT, from the Committee on Finance, returned
                            Senator Ferguson's bill [10] introduced Saturday, recommending passage
                            with the following amendment - strike out the second section and insert
                            in lieu thereof -
                        SEC. 2. The Governor may, in his discretion, distribute public arms as
                            herein provided, to any incorporated town or city, notwithstanding any
                            other law in conflict therewith.
                        The report was concurred in and so the amendment was adopted.
                        
                            VOLUNTEERS.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER, from the Committee on Finance,
                                returned Senator March's bill, No. 16, introduced yesterday recommending the following
                                amendments - strike out in the sixth line, these words"The Inspector
                                General of the Commissary Department," and insert these words: "Of
                                urgent necessity the Governor;" also, after the word "notice," in
                                the tenth line of same section, these words, "Of not less than ten
                                nor m than sixty days, as the case may require;" also, strike out in
                                the second section these words, " Inspector General of this
                                Department," and insert these words, "The Governor."
                            The report was concurred in, and on motion by Mr. MARCH, the bill was
                                considered as engrossed and read the third time.
                            On the further motion by Mr. MARCH, by consent, section third was
                                amended by inserting therein in the third line after the word "nor," these words"Inspector General or Regimental
                                Quartermaster or Commissary."
                            The bill, as amended, was then finally passed the Senate by yeas 40,
                                nays 0.
                        
                        
                            A REJECTED PROPOSITION.
                            Mr. BLAIR introduced a bill to provide for the payment of certain
                                claims against the State, to prohibit the payment of certain other
                                claims, defining certain misdemeanors, and prescribing punishment
                                therefor.
                            The PRESIDENT. The Chair understands the provision of the rule
                                adopted by the Senate to prohibit the introduction of anything that
                                would originate party discussion; and although this one might not
                                come under this head exactly as other bills of a similar character
                                have been ruled out by the Chair, I feel disposed to do so on this
                                occasion.
                            So Mr. Blair withdrew his bill.
                        
                        
                            BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                            Mr. RAY offered the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Doorkeeper contract
                                            with the proprietors for six hundred copies of Drapier's
                                            Brevier Legislative Reports, embracing the proceedings
                                            and debates o the present session of the General
                                            Assembly, for the use of members of the Senate, the same
                                            to be paper covered and delivered to the Secretary of
                                            State, and by him to be sent by mail, twelve copies to
                                            each member as soon possible after the adjournment of
                                            the session; Provided said Reports
                                            shall not cost more than one-third of one cent a page
                                            per copy.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. RAY. I will state in reference to this resolution that it is
                                providing for the same number of copies that we subscribed for last
                                session. This session will be a short one, and of course the reports
                                will be brief, and will cost the State but little. It is a matter of
                                interest to Senators and to the public that these Reports should be
                                published in this brevier style. I believe the House has already
                                provided for a similar number.
                            Mr. WAGNER. I would inquire whether the law authorizing the
                                employment of a Legislation Reporter was passed at the last
                                session?
                            Mr. BLAIR. It did not pass.
                            Mr. BEESON. I do not see any absolute necessity for the publication
                                of these Reports. I think it is putting the State to an unnecessary
                                ex penne, and I will test the sense of the Senate by moving to lay
                                the resolution on the table.
                            The yeas and nays were demanded by Messrs Conner and Beeson, and they
                                were ordered.
                            Mr. HAMILTON. There is no person more liberal in matters of this kind
                                than myself. I have
                        
                    
                
                


                
                    BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.

                            a very high opinion of the gentlemen who make these Reports, but now
                                I feel that the State is running very fast into bankruptcy, and, as
                                far as my vote is concerned, I will not make an appropriation of a
                                single dollar that the State can save.
                            The yeas and nays were now taken, and resulted as follows:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        YEAS - Messrs. Anthony, Bearss, Beeson, Berry, Campbell,

                            Pending the roll call -
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL said: I shall vote to lay the resolution on the table
                                for the reason that I do not know when this session will adjourn. If
                                the session should be protracted till the latter part of this month
                                for the purpose of perfecting its legislation, then it might become
                                necessary to publish these Reports; and I will then go with the
                                Senator from Shelby. For the present I shall vote to lay the
                                resolution on the table.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON said: I am inclined to take these Reports, but from
                                the fact that I understand it is quite likely there will be an
                                adjourned session and we can vote for them hereafter, I shall vote
                                for the motion to lay on the table, not meaning to reject them.
                            Mr. WAGNER said: At the end of the session, which I apprehend will be
                                at the end of forty days, although there may be a recess of a week
                                or two, I will be willing to vote for the resolution; but at this
                                time certainly not.
                            The result of the vote was then announced - yeas 26, nays 14 - as
                                above recorded.
                            So the resolution lies on the table.
                            Mr. COBB offered the following joint resolution [S. No. 4]:
                            A joint resolution authorizing the Governor to employ medical aid for
                                the soldiers, at Camp Morton No. 2.
                            WHEREAS, There are a number of soldiers in the service of the State,
                                at Camp Morton No. 2; AND WHEREAS, said soldiers have no medical aid
                                provided for them by the State, therefore,
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Be it Resolved by the Senate of the State of
                                                Indiana, (The House of Representatives
                                            concurring therein,) That. His Excellency, the Governor,
                                            be and is hereby authorized to contract, on the part of
                                            the State, with some responsible physician, on such
                                            terms as he may deem proper, to visit said camp and
                                            render such medical aid as may be necessary for the
                                            health and comfort of the soldiers quartered
                                            therein.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. COBB. I have made inquiry with reference to the facts contained
                                in this resolution, and I understand there is no medical aid in Camp
                                Morton No. 2; and I understand there are some soldiers there in bad
                                health. I think it is necessary that some medical aid should be
                                procured for them, and therefore I introduced this resolution, and
                                think it ought to pass.
                            The joint resolution was adopted by yeas 40, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            THE DISTRIBUTION OF ARMS.
                            On motion by Mr. FERGUSON, his arms bill, (reported from the
                                    military committee early this morning,) was
                                taken from the files and read the third time.
                            Mr. FERGUSON. I will state the necessity for this bill. The other day
                                we passed a bill in regard to the distribution of arms in the
                                different counties, in which there was a proviso, authorizing their
                                distribution according to the 69th chapter of the Revised Statutes
                                of 1852. That chapter requires county boards to make the
                                distribution to volunteer companies, and the object of this bill is
                                to make incorporated cities and towns give the bonds, instead of the
                                companies themselves, and relieve the companies of that necessity.
                                Some little conflict is now going on, as to how these arms shall be
                                distributed.
                            The bill then finally passed the Senate by yeas 36, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            RE-ORGANIZATION OF THE MILITIA.
                            On motion by Mr. BLAIR, Senator Anthony's military bill (introduced
                                yesterday afternoon) was taken from the files, under a dispensation
                                of the rules - yeas 41, nays 0 - read the second time by title only,
                                and referred to the Committee on Military
                                Affairs.
                        
                        
                            BIBLES FOR INDIANA VOLUNTEERS.
                            The PRESIDENT directed the' Secretary to read a communication from
                                Col. J. J. Reynolds, commanding at Camp Morton, recommending to the
                                favorable consideration of officers and members of the Legislature
                                the appeal from the Indianapolis Female Bible Society for aid in the
                                matter of procuring bibles and testaments to be distributed among
                                the Indiana volunteers.
                            Mr. WAGNER. A committee of the officers of the society named in the
                                communication are here. They desire to furnish to each soldier a
                                copy of the bible, to be purchased by the contributions of
                                individuals, and they will be most happy to receive any contribution
                                that Senators and Representatives choose to make. The ladies have
                                already supplied many soldiers, and they intend to supply every
                                soldier. This is their object - it explains itself and needs no
                                explanation or encomium.
                            
                            Mr. TURNER. I move that the Senator from Warren [Mr. Wagner] be
                                appointed a committee of one to go round with a hat.
                            Mr. WAGNER. I apprehend that would not suit the taste of the
                                ladies.
                            Mr. TURNER withdrew his motion.
                            And then came the recess till two o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            A message from the House, enclosing amendments of that body to
                                Senator Stone's $25,000 bill, [12] introduced Saturday, was taken
                                up, the amendments considered and referred to the committee
                                    on Finance.
                            Mr. MARCH, from the Judiciary Committee, returned
                                Senator Cravens' felony bill, [5] see Page 8 of the BREVIER REPORTS,
                                recommending passage, with the following amendments: Insert after
                                the word "thereof," 9th line, 5th part of 1st section, the words:
                                "Or any military post, fortification or military stores." Insert in
                                the first blank in section 2,"the words "ten thousand dollars;" in
                                the second blank the word "two;" in the third blank insert
                                "twenty-one." Strike out the proviso of said section. Strike out the
                                third section. Strike out of the fourth section the words "with or
                                without process."
                            The report was concurred in and the amendments were adopted.
                            On motion by Mr. CONNER, the bill was considered as engrossed and
                                read the third time.
                            Mr. WOLFE. Mr. President. Although a member of the Judiciary
                                    Committee I was not aware that this bill was to be
                                reported on until it was sent up to the Secretary's desk just now. I
                                am not complaining, however, of that. But there was a good deal of
                                division of opinion in the committee as to what should be done in
                                the matter. There were three bills before the committee, and not a
                                unanimity of opinion in regard to either one of them as to what kind
                                of legislation ought to be adopted for the purpose of meeting the
                                extraordinary condition of affairs in which we are involved. A good
                                many of the things in this bill would be provided for by a simple
                                provision against treason, and I believe it is the intention of the
                                committee to prepare a bill defining treason and the punishment
                                therefor. Several things in this bill, and all which relates to
                                regulating commerce between the States, I think, would be proper
                                subjects of legislation for the Congress of the United States. For
                                the doing of any of the things contained in this act I can have no
                                excuse for any man because they ought not to be done. But there is
                                danger that this Legislature may go too far; and while they are
                                attempting to prevent acts that ought not to be done, the law itself
                                would become an engine by which harmless transactions would be
                                prohibited, under the bill as it was originally introduced or with
                                the amendments proposed by the committee. This bill can become an
                                engine of oppression in the hands of the officials of the State. The
                                bill as it stands in the printed copy, in section 4, provides:
                            SEC. 4. Every judge of a court, Justice of the peace, mayor or
                                recorder of a city, sheriff, coroner, marshal of a city, and
                                constable shall have power, and it shall be his duty to prevent
                                violations of this act, and for that purpose every such officer
                                shall have power, with or without process, to arrest persons and
                                seize property any where within the jurisdiction of this - State,
                                and to call to his aft the power of his county, and any military
                                force in the service of the State in such county.
                            Now I am opposed to giving any such power in the hands of officers
                                without legal process. The amendment, as proposed by the committee
                                to this section is to strike out the words "with or with, out
                                process." I contend that that leaves the matter precisely
                                as in the printed bill. That the power is conferred upon the
                                officers to act and they will have the power to act without proceaa,
                                I can never give my sanction to a law which will give to any one
                                officer or number of officers, upon their own motion and without
                                proper legal process of law, to take such extraordinary proceedings
                                over persons and property in the State of Indiana. Before I will
                                vote to surrender my private rights and the liberties of the people
                                of Indiana, I would suffer my right arm to fall. Which would liberty
                                in Indiana be worth if every constable and justice of the peace
                                would have a right to do as he thinks proper, and be irresponsible
                                to every human being upon earth? I think the bill should be amended
                                in that particular.
                            If it is attempted to stop the commerce between this State and other
                                States it should be done in a legal way. It is insisted and claimed
                                that it is proper for the State of Indiana to regulate commerce
                                between her citizens and the citizens of Southern States who may not
                                be in rebellion against the General Government; but I will not
                                undertake to go so far as to say whether we have the right to do so
                                or not. Gentlemen who have conversed with me unanimously agree that
                                it is proper for the Congress of the United States to legislate upon
                                this subject, but the necessity is urged at the present time -
                                before the Congress of the United States shall assemble - and
                                therefore it is necessary to pass a bill something after the fashion
                                of this one. And I do not know bit what there may be some truth in
                                this view of the case. There may be a necessity for present action.
                                I am rather inclined to think there is, for this reason: That unless
                                some law is made, properly guarded, to prevent the exportation of
                                pro duce and contraband articles to the Southern States, mobs,
                                vigilance committees, or whatever else they may be denominated, will
                                attempt to do it. To prevent these things being done in an illegal
                                manner, I grant, it may be necessary to pass some law to regulate
                                this matter. But, sir, there are other things in the bill that may
                                lead to abuses ten times worse than any condition of things we have
                                ever had in this free country. The first clause of the first section
                                provides:
                            That it shall be unlawful for any person or persons to do, or to advise, or counsel any other person to do,
                                or to directly or indirectly assist, aid or abet in doing, or to
                                advise or counsel any other person to aid, assist or abet in doing
                                any or either of the things below in this section specified.
                            You do not only propose to punish men for what they do, following the
                                spirit of the constitution, which says treason shall consist only in
                                an overt act of levying war or giving aid and comfort to the enemy
                                in times of war, but you go farther than that, and make it an engine
                                that can be used to prevent the liberty of speech and of the press.
                                I admit the things ought not to be done that are prohibited here,
                                but how easy it is to construe an innocent act or innocent counsel
                                     into penal acts, especially
                                by partizan officers, in times of excitement such as we now have.
                                But I understand it to be the settled doctrine that when Congress
                                undertakes to regulate commerce between the States of this Union it
                                will nullify or supercede the acts of this Legislature; and as
                                Congress will most likely do so at an early day there can be no
                                great hurry for our action, except it be to meet a temporary
                                necessity of the case, and to that extent by a properly framed law I
                                am willing to go.
                            Another objection I have to the bill, which I wish to state before
                                the vote is taken, is this: It is, sir, legislating upon the
                                supposition which is taken for granted, and which I undertake to say
                                is a falsehood, that there are men in the State of Indiana who would
                                be guilty of counseling treason, or of doing any act except those
                                acts which amount to lawful commerce. But as to those other acts
                                here provided against it is a gratuitous libel upon the State of
                                Indiana to say that there are any set of men any where in the State
                                who would undertake, by combining, counseling, or any other act to
                                betray the State or the Federal Government in the hands of the
                                enemies. Why, sir, what do we behold in testimony of the loyalty and
                                patriotism of the people of the State of Indiana? The Capital is
                                literally overrun with men of all parties who have volunteered to
                                show their devotion to the stars and stripes on the battle field, if
                                need be, in defense of our glorious flag. I do not believe there is
                                a traitor in the State. I know there are men who were opposed to the
                                policy which has brought these things upon the country; but sir,
                                when the government which has the right to decide the questions of
                                peace and war, commands the services of the people, party and all
                                party divisions cease, and we are all as one man for the Union, the
                                Constitution and the enforcement of the laws. But while this is
                                true, we are not willing that liberty should be stricken down, that
                                free speech and the press should be under the irresponsible
                                censorship of constables and justices of the peace.
                            Mr. CONNER. I shall confine my remarks to the several principles of
                                the bill and not to the details. I do not remember that the Senator
                                from Harrison proposed any amendment in committee, so far as it
                                relates to the details of the bill, although he may have done so. It
                                affords me some gratification to know that this bill was introduced
                                by the Hon. Senator from Jefferson one of the counties on the
                                border. Let me call the attention of the Senate for a moment to some
                                of the facts and circumstances which surround us. A number of the
                                States of this Union are in open rebellion to the government of the
                                United States. We are looking, if we take the word of gentlemen
                                residing upon the border counties, for raids to be made upon the
                                soil of Indiana by a portion of those seceded States. We have heard
                                from time to time that it was necessary to spend a large amount of
                                money for the purpose of putting arms into the hands of those
                                citizens in order that they may protect their persons and property.
                                Now what is the purpose contemplated by this bill? It is the purpose
                                of this bill to regulate commerce between the States - to interfere
                                with the legitimate and honest trade between Indiana and Kentucky,
                                or any other loyal State? The only purpose is to prevent persons of
                                this State from enlisting in the secession organizations for the
                                purpose of furnishing the rebel government with supplies, and more
                                especially to prevent the shipping of produce to the Southern
                                seceded States. It does not propose to interfere with the trade
                                between the citizens of Indiana and Kentucky if the produce is not
                                to be used for the purpose of strengthening the hands of our
                                enemies. Our neighbors of Cincinnati are complaining that while they
                                shut their port against the exportation of produce, Indiana is in
                                the habit of permitting large quantities to be shipped to the South
                                every day. Is this right? I say it is not right. Gentlemen say that
                                it is a slander upon the people of Indiana to assume that they would
                                be guilty of anything in this bill. They may as well say that it a
                                slander to have a criminal code upon our statute books, because by
                                having a criminal code it presupposes that there are persons who
                                commit arson, murder, rapine and all sorts of crimes. It was only
                                yesterday that I took up a morning paper and read of immense
                                shipments of produce from New Albany to the South, but I was
                                gratified to learn, on showing the paragraph to the Senator from
                                Floyd, that it occurred some weeks ago, though I had supposed from
                                reading the article, that it had occurred recently. I hope we will
                                hear of no such thing occurring there in the future. I am willing,
                                as far as my vote is concerned, to vote a reasonable amount of money
                                to put Indiana in a proper state of defense against our enemies, and
                                at the same time I regard it as my duty to give my vote for the
                                prohibition of provisions for the purpose of strengthening the hands
                                of our enemies. I will not detain the Senate longer. As far as I am
                                concerned I am prepared to vote for this bill.
                            Mr. RAY. I feel disposed to offer a few remarks explanatory of my
                                vote on this occasion. I think the bill is objectionable; first,
                                because in its whole scope it is in derogation of the rights and
                                authority of the Federal Government; and second, as a practical
                                measure it is impolitic because it does not reach and accomplish the
                                ends at which it aims. It is an attempt to regulate commerce between
                                the States, which right is exclusively given by the constitution to
                                the Congress of the United States. And again, it is going another
                                step in that direction to which we are, I believe too much at
                                present in the North, fatally tending, and that is to act as
                                separate communities, separate States and independencies, in the
                                prosecution of this war, as it is sometimes called, but which I say
                                is merely an effort on the part of the Federal Government to put
                                down rebellion. It will be a dangerous epoch in our history if we
                                give way to this tendency to take the authority which is vested in
                                the Federal Government into the hands of States, communities, and
                                unauthorized mobs. That is the great danger we are in in
                                the Northern States.
                            [Mr. R. spoke at length. His speech may be published hereafter.]
                            After speeches by Mr. MARCH in favor and Mr. WILLIAMS in opposition
                                to the bill-
                            Mr. WOLFE moved to recommit the bill with  instructions to strike out all after
                                the enacting clause and insert Senator Miller's bill, [4.]
                            On motion by Mr. CLAYPOOL, this motion was laid on the table - yeas
                                25, nays 16 - as follows:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        YEAS - Messrs. Anthony, Bearss, Beeson, Berry, Blair,
                                            Campbell, Claypool, Conner, Cravens of Jefferson,
                                            Culver, Dickinson, Hamilton, Hull, Line, March, Mellett,
                                            Newcomb, Robinson, Steele, Stone,Studabaker, Tarkington,
                                            Teegarden, Turner and White - 25.
                                        NAYS - Messrs. Carnahan, Cobb, Conley, Johnston, Jones,
                                            Landers, Miller, O'Brien, Odell, Ray, Shields,
                                            Shoemakers, Shoulders, Williams, Wilson and Wolfe -
                                            16.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. STUDABAKER said he had supposed that his amendment would have
                                been adopted by consent, as he had not supposed that any Senator
                                proposed to abridge the right of speech or the freedom of the press,
                                and had offered the amendment more to prevent a misconstruction of
                                the bill than to change any legal construction that might be given
                                to the bill; but Senators objected to the amendment, therefore he
                                must insist upon it. For his own part he desired to reserve the
                                right to speak and write freely of the plans and purposes of the
                                Administration, and unless that right existed there could be no
                                liberty. He did not suppose it was intended to prevent anything of
                                the kind, but hoped the power would not be placed in the hands of an
                                irresponsible constable to seize a man because he might think he was
                                about to say something that would be seditions. He closed by moving
                                to recommit with instructions to amend by adding these words:
                                "Nothing in this act shall be construed to abridge the right of
                                speech or the freedom of the press," as heretofore understood.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL replied.
                            Mr. MILLER offered the following instructions: Strike out the words
                                "justice of peace, coroner and constable," in the 4th section. He
                                preferred his bill on this subject to the one under consideration,
                                but would waive his objections in view of the endorsement of this
                                bill by the committee.
                            Mr. LANDERS offered the following instructions: Insert in lines
                                twenty and thirty-three, in the first section, and in the first line
                                in second section, the word "knowingly."
                            Mr. WOLFE offered the following instructions: Insert in the fourth
                                line of the fourth section, be fore the words "to arrest," the
                                words, "with legal process."
                            Mr. HAMILTON would like to see the bill amended in one or two
                                particulars, but was prepared to vote for the bill anyhow.
                            Mr. President CRAVENS. (Mr. Tarkington in the Chair.) I frankly
                                confess that I do not claim any credit for originating the bill
                                under consideration, but I endorse every particular, every sentence
                                and every line in it; and I regret that the committee on
                                    the judiciary has seen proper to emasculate the bill
                                as it is. Now sir, what is this bill in aid of if it is not in aid
                                of the right of the freedom of speech? What is this great uprising
                                of the people for if it is not in defense of the freedom of speech,
                                for in no government has that right been guaranteed as it has been
                                by this government, and it is for aiding the power of this
                                government in this direction that this bill is introduced. If any
                                Senator here is honestly convinced that even a single sentence of
                                this bill can be construed into a restriction or restraint of the
                                freedom of speech, where that freedom ought to be indulged in under
                                the constitutions of the State and of the United States, then I am
                                perfectly willing to see the amendment of the Senator from Adams
                                [Mr. Studabaker] incorporated. The first clause of the first section
                                is the one introduced in evidence that this bill is intended to
                                interfere with the freedom of speech. Is there any unnatural
                                restraint there? Are we to sit quietly by if any of our citizens are
                                disposed to write to the rebel government and slander and vilify us?
                                or are we to sit calmly down at home and see our neighbors, with
                                their sympathies, going out in letters, inviting an invasion of our
                                firesides? Would this not be treason? - giving aid and comfort to
                                the enemy? In time of peace had there been no insurrection there
                                would have been no necessity, and no man upon this floor would have
                                dreamed of introducing a bill of this sort. But Senators say why not
                                permit those people to sell their provisions in order to fill our
                                coffers with the money of traitors, though we may fatten, and pamper
                                and strengthen traitors, that they may be the more able to rob us pf
                                our lives. An affecting appeal was made by my friend on the left to
                                my venerable friend on the right; but I apprehend there is no court
                                on earth that would punish a man under those circumstances. But
                                suppose there was an hostile army quartered opposite his own town or
                                county, and it was the policy of those people to starve out that
                                army, and we of Madison should sit down quietly and send out our
                                provisions for the purpose of sustaining that army, what would our
                                old friend say? Why sir, that thing is not so far removed from a
                                possibility, a probability or even a fact.
                            The Senator from Shelby talks eloquently about mobs and mob violence.
                                Let me say that this bill originated in an earnest and sincere
                                desire to avoid that difficulty. I speak of facts cognizant by
                                myself, not one week since, when I say that more than one large
                                shipping house undertook to ship provisions to Louisville from
                                Madison, thence to go direct by rail to feed the rebels in the city
                                of Charleston; our people raised en masse and told
                                them that that shipment was the last one to be made of
                                those provisions that should go to fatten those people who would
                                perhaps shoot down their own children. Sir, if it is right for the
                                public sentiment to take this matter in hand, is it not right that
                                public sentiment should be fortified by the laws of the land.
                            Sir, have you no laws upon your statute book punishing murder, and
                                does that imply that every citizen within the borders of the State
                                of Indiana is a murderer? Have you no laws against perjury, and are
                                all your citizens consequently perjured villians and scoundrels? By
                                no means, but these laws are to prevent and punish those crimes. It
                                is to prevent the crime of treason that we ask for the passage of
                                this bill. But gentlemen say it is assuming the rights and powers
                                and privileges that do not belong to us - the only argument I heard
                                on this floor yet against the bill. In answer to that objection I
                                propose simply to refer to the Constitution of the United
                                States.
                            
                            [Mr. C. continued his remarks for some, but they are crowded out for
                                want of time for preparation.]
                            Mr. MELLETT. I think the amendment proposed by the gentleman from
                                Adams [Mr. Studabaker] is unnecessary - it would be but reenacting
                                the Constitution of this State and of the United States, which I
                                have always understood as still in force. I am satisfied with the
                                general principles contained in this bill, and I do apprehend that
                                if the bill is fairly considered gentlemen will find no objection to
                                it. I object to the bill only so far as phraseology is concerned -
                                there are too many words in the bill.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER withdrew his motion to recommit, and -
                            On motion by Mr. CONNER, the order to consider the bill as engrossed
                                for the third reading was rescinded.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER then offered his instructions, as printed above, by
                                way of amendment to the bill.
                            Mr. WAGNER and Mr. MELLETT discussed, attacked and defended the
                                phraseology of the bill.
                            Mr. LANDERS moved to recommit the bill with the pending
                                amendment.
                            Mr. WAGNER made an ineffectual motion - yeas 17, nays 20 - to lay
                                this motion on the table.
                            Mr. MELLETT submitted instruction to strike out the fourth
                                section.
                            And then the motion to recommit was agreed to.
                            On motion by Mr. WAGNER, the militia'bill [H. 21] was taken from the
                                files; when he moved that the rules be suspended and read the bill
                                the first and second times by title only.
                            The ayes and nays being demanded by a constitutional provision, and
                                being taken -
                            The PRESIDENT reported no quorum voting.
                            And then the Senate adjourned.
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            THURSDAY, May 2, 1861.
                        
                        On the motion of Mr. BUNDY, the reading of the Journal of yesterday was
                            dispensed with.
                        On the motion of Mr. GRESHAM, the consideration of the special order, the
                            Senate six regiment bill, was passed over, and the unfinished business,
                            viz: the consideration of the Committee's Militia bill, No. 21, was
                            taken up - the question being on the adoption of Mr. Parrett's amendment
                            to the ninth section, viz: "No company shall be mustered into the
                            regular service of the United States with a less number than sixty-four
                            privates"
                        Mr. DOBBINS proposed not more than half-pay for officers of organized
                            companies; which was laid on the table.
                        Mr. GRESHAM. The bill having now been examined at leisure, and having the
                            attention and and corrections of the best military men in the
                            State, he proposed that the House pass it as a whole without further
                            amendment - to save time.
                        Mr. SMITH of Bartholomew. If you undertake to force the bill on us, you
                            can't pass it all.
                        Mr. HEFFREN was willing to take the best bill he could get - that which
                            would conduce to the best interests of the State, without regard to his
                            individual preferences. He wished particularly one amendment to be added
                            to the thirtieth section in these words: ''Provided that in the
                            organization of said regiments of cavalry, preference shall be given to
                            companies organized in the First, Second, Third, and Fourth
                            Congressional districts." He thought it reasonable that the people of
                            the Ohio river counties should have this preference, because they had
                            not been able to get their men in the six regiments already in the
                            service. He insisted also that they should have cavalry there. He would
                            not give a baubee for property there exposed to
                            marauding scouts on horse-back, unless it were protected by cavalry.
                            That whole river coast of 350 miles was at the mercy of invaders.
                        Mr. FISHER. The amendment would be more germain to the six regiment
                            bill.
                        Mr. HEFFREN. But then, if that bill should fail we would be left at the
                            mercy of the Goths and Vandals. Up north there is no danger from cavalry
                            incursions. But the telegraph informs us this morning that there is no
                            doubt a discent is contemplated and will soon be made upon Cairo. All we
                            ask is to have the preference in the organization of this force which is
                            to protect our own homes, and fire-sides.
                        Mr. FISHER. The bill, I believe, authorizes the organization of cavalry
                            companies to any extent.
                        Mr. HEFFREN. As it may be found expedient. But who's to judge of
                            that?
                        Mr. FISHER, those who form the companies, I apprehend.
                        Mr. HEFFREN. If gentlemen are willing to let the cavalry section go into
                            the bill, why not let this amendment go in also?
                        Mr. FISHER. I have no objection.
                        Mr. KITCHEN supported the amendment.
                        The amendment was subsequently adopted, prefixing these words: "In the
                            distribution of arms," those regiments shall have the preference.
                        Mr. KNOWLTON. As I read the bill there is no limit to the term of the
                            commissions of the officers appointed by the Governor.
                        Mr. GRESHAM, having demanded the previous question and withdrawn it,
                            said, the object was not to force the passage of the bill, but to save
                            time. If there was anything material overlooked in the bill it could be
                            applied by the Senate committee.
                        Mr. Jenkinson proposed to amend the 60th section so as to make the Major
                            elective by the rank and file of the battalion.
                        Mr. SHERMAN. It seems to me gentlemen forget the labor and time that have
                            been expended by the committee in the preparation of this bill. We have
                            discussed it all section by section and line by line, without party or
                            personal feeling. And where there has been any differences of opinion in
                            the committee, we have submitted them to those who ought to understand
                            such questions better than we do. The change proposed by this amendment
                            has caused more difference of opinion than any other but at last there
                            was a unanimous expression in favor of the bill as it stands - that
                            these officers should be appointed by the Governor. Therefore, I shall
                            oppose the amendment. I hope gentle-  men will remember that it is impossible to draw a bill that will suit
                            all and at the same time give the deference that is due to the opinions
                            of military men.
                        Mr. FISHER. I think I can discover that this bill is to be a failure, on
                            account of the disposition of members to make amendments. I understand
                            that all the sections of this bill have been arranged with reference to
                            their connection one with another all through. I do not think the House
                            can make the bill any better. There are indeed some points in which I
                            think it might be improved; but I am clearly of the opinion the bill is
                            better this moment than it will be two hours hence.
                        Mr. KNOWLTON, (interrupting.) Has the gentleman read those two portions
                            of the bill which allows both the Governor and Colonels to appoint the
                            Colonels' staff?
                        Mr. FISHER. I have not. I admit readily that I may not have the capacity
                            of other gentlemen for careful reading; but still I have read it
                            carefully. But I was going on to say, if we go on making amendments to
                            suit the views of gentlemen in all the sections, when we get through it
                            will be a disjointed concern. Now I think we had better pass the bill as
                            it is. There is no crying objections to it. It might be improved, but I
                            apprehend this House can't do it; that every effort they make to improve
                            it will be at the expense of some other part that will be fatal. It is
                            true that amendments like that proposed by the gentleman from Alien
                            might be made without fatal effect. That is an amendment that pertains
                            to the whole bill, and may be made without disarranging it. But in my
                            opinion the bill places the appointing power right now. The one man
                            power is necessary in all military operations.
                        Mr. KNOWLTON. Is it necessary to have three Majors? This bill requires
                            that three Majors shall be appointed to each regiment.
                        Mr. GRESHAM. The gentleman, is altogether mistaken when he reads the bill
                            in that way; or that the Governor and Colonels both shall appoint the
                            Colonel's staff. It simply requires the Governor to direct the Colonels
                            to fill their staff appointments.
                        Mr. PACKARD proposed to amend Mr. Jenkinson's amendment so as to make the
                            Majors elective by the Captains of battalions. He said last winter when,
                            as chairman of the committee on corporations, he had
                            prepared an insurance bill, under the advice of insurance men, it was in
                            vain that he claimed the argument of their experience in favor of the
                            bill. It was in vain that he set up the same claim now made for this
                            bill by the gentleman from Wabash. It was important that the Captains of
                            a battalion should elect their superior officers, for the reason that
                            they are - most directly concerned as to their qualifications. Unless
                            they have men to command them skilled in the military art, bold and
                            courageous, they bring upon themselves disgrace and dishonor. Therefore
                            they ought to be the men to select their superior officers. No set of
                            Captains would elect an inefficient field officer, on account of
                            personal preferences and friendship. They would select an enemy in
                            preference, if known to be more efficient in battle. He was opposed to
                            the one man power. He thought his proposition better than that of the
                            gentleman from Alien; but he would infinitely prefer that to the bill as
                            it now stands.
                        Mr. CASON. It seems to me any candid man, looking at this bill for a
                            moment, will come to the conclusion that it is unwise to adopt either of
                            these amendments. The Governor is Commander-in-Chief of the militia,
                            consequently he is responsible for the acts of the officers he appoints,
                            His responsibility should carry with it the right to determine who shall
                            fill these places. The gentleman from Marshall proposes that the
                            Captains shall elect Majors to avoid favoritism. Are there no favontisms
                            - no combinations - no rivalries with Captains. But the Governor is
                            above all these little rivalries and aspirations. They would not
                            influence his mind. Besides the Governor has appointed these officers
                            from time immemorial. Why then make this exception now? The gentleman
                            from Alien had admitted that the appointments had been well enough in
                            his county.
                        Mr. JENKINSON. Those appointments are lawyers - clever fellows - but they
                            are not fit for service, though appointed by my Governor.
                        Mr. CASON. Now I ask him whether Governor Willard was not better
                            qualified to make those appointments than the young men, farmers and
                            mechanics, in the ranks.
                        Mr. JENKINSON. From the character of the appointments, I say he was
                            not.
                        Mr. CASON. It is surprising for a man to state that the Governor of the
                            State of Indiana should not be better qualified for making military
                            appointments than young men taken out of the fields and workshops,
                            without reading in military books, and wholly without experience as
                            military men.
                        Mr. FISHER. The rule the Governor has adopted for the appointment of
                            field officers is, to make no appointment not fully recommended by his
                            brother officers.
                        Mr. CASON. There could be little doubt about the Governor's exercising a
                            sound discretion in this matter at this time. It was absolutely
                            necessary that he should have control now. To divide our militia upon
                            this point, would be to utterly destroy its efficiency. He would not
                            give a cent for it.
                        Mr. DOBBINS considered that military offices should be conferred on the
                            same liberal rule that, obtains in the conferment of civil position. Men
                            engaged in the military service were none the less free men.
                        Mr. STOTSENBERG demanded the previous question, and there was a
                            second.
                        Mr. HEFFREN demanded a division of the question, and under its operation
                            Mr. Packard's amendment was rejected.
                        The yeas and nays being demanded, ordered and taken on the other division
                            of the main question, viz.: Will the House strike out the words, "the
                            Governor shall appoint," and insert: "the men of the battalion shall
                            elect?" the result was - yeas 48, nays 39 - as follows:

                        Mr. McLEAN, pro forma. I voted against taking this
                            appointing power out of the hands of the Governor, because I do not
                            think there can be much democracy injected into any efficient military
                            system. Candidacies will excite rivalries, &c.
                        So the amendment was adopted.
                        Mr. FISHER. Now that the House has determined to take the appointing
                            power from the Governor, I propose the following, though in opposition
                            to my own views:
                        Amend by striking out of the bill all that relates to the appointment of
                            Colonels, Lieut. Colonels and Majors, and providing for their election
                            by the commissioned officers of the regiment.
                        Mr. FRASIER must express his dissent from this amendment. He was
                            disgusted with this electioneering and button-holing, which it would
                            inaugurate.
                        Mr. Speaker ALLEN, (Mr. Lane in the chair.) Whilst he was favorable to
                            the general idea of Mr. Dobbins, to make our military system conform to
                            our civil institutions, he could not forget the circumstances - the
                            necessity of active service now upon us. If we did not want an efficient
                            system, we might look to the democracy of the thing, but we must look to
                            efficiency. A military organization was entirely different from civil
                            organizations. In the military service a man surrenders his right of
                            self-control to a despotism; whereas in civil matters, we get as far as
                            possible from any despotic one-man-power. The rules for the selection of
                            civil officers should have little to do with the selection of military
                            commands. He was opposed to the amendment of the gentleman from Allen,
                            making the majors of battalions elective by the men; but he acquiesced
                            in the mind of the House. He hoped however that the bill would not be
                            changed with respect to the superior field officers. So he hoped the
                            House would not adopt the amendment of the gentleman from Wabash.
                        Mr. HOLCOMB. There was a want of agreement in the argument of gentlemen
                            with the spirit of our civil institutions. Mr. McLean says candidacy
                            makes rivalry. It does the same thing in candidacies for civil office.
                            Were not men in the military service intelligent enough to select their
                            own commanders? He was in favor of extending the elective franchise to
                            every man capable of exercising it. There was even a closer connection
                            between military officers and the men of their commands, than between
                            citizens and our civil officials.
                        Mr. FISHER. Having offered the amendment, I desire to explain the reason
                            that induced it - The House, by a decided majority, have agreed to take
                            the power of the appointment of Major from the Governor. Now I apprehend
                            there is no reason why the Colonel and Lieutenant - Colonel should not
                            derive their appointment from the same source as the Major. My desire
                            was to place them on the same footing. But I want it distinctly
                            understood that I am against the amendment. I am in favor of having the
                            Governor to appoint. Although I am clearly of opinion that the interests
                            of the service require the Governor to appoint, still, if the House
                            think otherwise, I will not say, therefore, that I will not vote for the
                            bill.
                        Mr. PACKARD. I think the gentlemen from Wabash, [Mr. Fisher,]
                            misapprehends the feeling of the House. I think it is the disposition of
                            the House to allow the men to elect such officers as have immediate
                            supervision, management and control of their commands.
                        Mr. RAGAN and others. That in right.
                        Mr. FISHER. I do not believe that as great efficiency can be obtained by
                            permitting the men of the battalion to elect their Majors as by having
                            them appointed by the Governor. For the Governor will not appoint a man
                            known to be obnoxious to the brigade or battalion. No Governor would
                            appoint a man if the brigade were opposed to him. But there are so many
                            influences always brought to bear at an election, that an inefficient
                            man would be just as likely to be elected as any other.
                        Mr. GIFFORD. If the Governor will appoint only those recommended by the
                            men, he could not see any impropriety in allowing the men to elect.
                        Mr. HEFFREN. I do not expect to get all my notions into any bill here.
                            None can reasonably expect that a bill of a hundred sections can pass so
                            as to suit the views of a hundred men. Since 1852 the Governors have
                            appointed all our military officers. I voted that the Majors should be
                            elective. But since I have not grumbled at the appointing power
                            heretofore, I will not now. I have been honored with a Colonel's
                            commission, and I was subsequently promoted to be Brigadier General,
                            though I do not know what for. I have not grumbled heretofore, nor have
                            my Democratic friends. Now that we are almost in a state of war, we have
                            certainly got to have one head one moving power. Now we have a
                            Republican Governor, I am not going to object to his doing what I was
                            willing a Democratic Governor should do.
                        Mr. DOBBINS. I go against it on principle because it takes away the
                            rights of freemen saps the liberties of the people.
                        Mr. HEFFREN. I presume there never was a war but what the liberties of
                            the people were sapped by it more or less. The military power will
                            necessarily do that to a certain extent. The true question is: Shall we
                            have efficient men to control our military system or not? I hope the
                            bill will not be sacrificed simply because this or that man can't get in
                            all his notions. I voted for the elective principle in the committee as
                            an, abstract principle, because I believe it right. Still I am ready to
                            yield my opinion to the judgment of the House. Let us come upon
                            something like a compromise that will divide the thing, if possible,
                            between the two extremes. I voted for the amendment of the gentlemen
                            from Cass, [Mr. Knowlton,] would still vote for it if it could carry.
                            But it is plain to every man that if this  disposition to amend is insisted upon we
                            shall slaughter the bill and go home without any military law.
                        Mr. CRAIN demanded the previous question, and there was a second. The
                            main question being on the adoption of Mr. Fisher's amendment. It was
                            rejected.
                        The fourth section being under consideration -
                        Mr. ROBBINS proposed to strike out the clause giving to the Governor
                            power to appoint Colonels and Lieutenant-Colonels, and insert: "Shall be
                            elected by the men composing each regiment, excepting the staff
                            officers."
                        Mr. FRASIER moved to lay the amendment on the table.
                        Messrs. PACKARD and HORTON demanded the yeas and nays, which being
                            ordered and taken resulted - yeas 59, nays 29 - as follows:
                        
                            
                                
                                    YEAS - Messrs. Anderson, Bingham, Brucker, Bundy, Chapman,
                                        Cameron, Campbell, Cason, Collins of Whitley, Crain,
                                        Dashiel, Davis, Epperson, Erwin, Feagler, Ferguson, Fisher,
                                        Fordyce, Fraley, Frasier, Gore, Gresham, Hall, Harvey,
                                        Haworth, Heffren, Henricks, Hopkins, Hudson, Hurd, Jones of
                                        Vermillion, Jones of Wayne, Kendrick, Lano, Lee, Ligbtner,
                                        McClurg, McLean, Moorman, Nebeker, Newman, Orr, Parrett,
                                        Kagan, Randall, Sloan, Sherman, Smith of Bartholomew, Smith
                                        of Miami, Thomas, Thompson, Turner, Underwood, Veatch,
                                        Wells, Wilson, Woodhull, Woods, Mr. Speaker - 59.
                                    NAYS - Messrs. Atkinson, Black, Brett, Collins of Adams,
                                        Combs, Cooprider, Dobbins, Edson, Fleming, Ford, Gifford,
                                        Holcomb, Horton, Howard, Jenkinson, Kitchen, Knowlton, Lods,
                                        Moss, Mutz, Owens, Packard, Pitts, Polk, Prow, Bobbins,
                                        Stevenson, Trier, Warrum - 29.
                                
                            
                        
                        So the amendment was laid on the table.
                        Mr. HEFFREN proposed to amend, by inserting "such officers (Colonels and
                            Lieut. Colonels,) shall be selected from their regiments respectively,
                            and serve for four years."
                        Mr. KNOWLTON proposed "one year;" which was rejected.
                        Mr. Heffren's amendment was then adopted.
                        Mr. SMITH, of Bartholomew, moved generally, that the words "or affirm,"
                            and "under the pains and penalties of penury," be properly inserted in
                            the form of the oaths prescribed in the bill.
                        The amendment was adopted.
                        Mr. McLEAN proposed to amend further, by striking out all that part of
                            the bill which re quires minors in the service, to give security for the
                            payment of fines.
                        The amendment was adopted.
                        Mr. GRESHAM proposed to amend so that the terms of the commissions of the
                            Major Generals and Brigadier Generals shall be four years; which was
                            adopted.
                        Mr. FORD. Since the House had voted down the elective principle, in
                            regard to the other field officers, he moved to reconsider the vote by
                            which Majors were made elective.
                        On motion of Mr. NEBEKER, Mr. Ford's motion was laid on the table.
                        Mr. KNOWLTON proposed an independent section to the following effect:
                        SEC.-. No commissioned officer, appointed or elected under the provisions
                            of this act, shall hold his office for a longer period than four
                            years.
                        The section was adopted.
                        Mr. THOMAS looked upon this bill as effectually knocking the military
                            system of the State into a cocked hat. But considering his want of
                            military reading, (though he had some experience,) and supposing others
                            in a similar condition with himself - incapable of discharging their
                            duties on this question, in view of the present crisis and in view of
                            the fact, that we can't get up military system that shall conform to the
                            principles of Republicanism, I propose the following:
                        Ordered, That the bill, No. 21, be referred to a
                            specific committee of eight, five to be appointed on the part of the
                            House, and three on the part of the Senate, and that the bill, when it
                            shall be by them perfected and reported back, be forthwith adopted
                            without the crossing of a t, or the dotting of an i.
                        The motion was laid on the table.
                        Mr. CRAIN deprecated earnestly the disposition he thought he saw in the
                            House, either not to pass the bill at all, or to destroy its efficiency,
                            and he would cut off his arm before he would vote for an inefficient
                            military bill in a time of war. If there was to be as much factious
                            opposition to the remainder of the bill, in proportion as had been
                            evinced against the few sections which had been passed, of course there
                            would be nothing done.
                        Mr. DOBBINS repelled the charge of desire defeat the bill factiously. He
                            was not governed by party feeling. He had voted for amendments upon a
                            principle that would secure the rights of men engaged in this war, and
                            resented any attempt to intimidate those who desired further
                            amendment.
                        Mr. BUNDY deprecated as a mutilation any attempt to infuse into this bill
                            the sentiments of Republicanism or Democracy. The bill was not yet
                            destroyed, though he considered its efficiency impaired very much. No
                            good could result from a recommitment of the bill. This House would take
                            nothing from a committee. We always demand to have every bill read here
                            by sections.
                        Mr. VEATCH spoke here for Mr. Heffren's amendment of 34th section, giving
                            the preference in the distribution of arms and enlistments for the
                            cavalry regiments to men from the First, Second, Third and Fourth
                            Congressional Districts; and it was agreed to.
                        The House the adjourned till 2 o'clock P. M.
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            On the motion of Mr. FISHER, the regular order of business was
                                suspended, and his two million loan bill [22] was taken up and
                                considered on the third reading.
                            Mr. ORR. The Governor asked for one million. He would like to know
                                the reason for making this loan two millions.
                            Mr. FISHER explained. The bonds will not be issued, "except the wants
                                of the treasury require them."
                            Mr. BLACK. The bonds are transferrable upon delivery. Is that the
                                case with our present State bonds? They are transferrable on the
                                books.
                            Mr. FISHER. It was thought they would be more acceptable in is this
                                shape.
                            After debate -
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG proposed the formula: "For the purpose of obtaining
                                money to repel invasion, and provide for the public defense, the
                                Governor is authorized to issue," etc.; which was adopted by
                                unanimous consent.
                            So the bill was passed the final reading - yeas  81, nays 0. Present and refusing to
                                vote - Messrs Kitchen, Collins of Adams, and Moss.
                            Ordered, That the Clerk acquaint the Senate
                                thereof.
                            The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Auditor,
                                Secretary and Treasurer of State, suggesting the necessity of
                                appropriations by law for binding the laws, etc.; which was referred
                                to the Committee on Ways and Means.

                            
                                ORGANIZATION OF THE MILITIA.
                                The consideration of the militia bill No. 21 was resumed.
                                Mr. JENKINSON proposed to amend the llth section, by making the
                                    Colonel and Lieutenant Colonel elective by the men of the
                                    regiment.
                                Mr. McLEAN objected to it as matter that had been voted down;
                                    and
                                The SPEAKER refused to entertain it.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON proposed to add to section 100 a provision to the
                                    effect, that nothing in this act shall prevent the continuance
                                    in office of any commissioned officer of the militia, who shall
                                    within thirty days after the passage of this act signify to the
                                    Governor his desire to continue in the service, and take the
                                    oath of this act.
                                After a running, humorous debate by Messrs. Knowlton, McLean,
                                    Packard, Orr, and Gresham, it was laid on the table.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON proposed to amend section 100 by striking out and
                                    substituting these words:
                                All laws and parts of laws in conflict with the provisions of
                                    this act are hereby repealed.
                                Mr. GRESHAM. What do you propose that for?
                                Mr. KNOWLTON. There is no provision in the bill for laying off
                                    the State into military districts, and the bill would be
                                    imperfect without that provision in the existing law.
                                Mr. RAGAN. What then becomes of the military reputation of those
                                    men who drafted the bill?
                                Mr. KNOWLTON. They have not yet got the power, and there is not
                                    resting upon them the responsibility of legislating for this
                                    State.
                                Mr. GRESHAM. I am satisfied that a large majority of the House
                                    desire to pass an efficient military bill; and I suppose these
                                    is not a man on the floor so blind as not to see that this
                                    amendment is simply hostile and striking at the whole bill.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON. The difficulty is, when we say the bill is
                                    extravagant and despotic, gentlemen tell us it must be so.
                                    Others tell as we are getting up a bill for all time to come.
                                    Then when we propose to amend they say we are opposed to any
                                    militia system.
                                Mr. GRESHAM. I do not object to the gentleman's right to oppose
                                    the bill. But the gentleman is mistaken when he says there is no
                                    provision in the bill for military divisions. The bill does
                                    provide for dividing the State into battalions, brigades and
                                    divisions, as the convenience of the service may require. The
                                    Governor does this. We do not go by counties or districts,
                                    because we can't get up forces that way.
                                The amendment was laid on the table.
                                So the bill was read through and considered by sections, without
                                    any further material amendment.
                                After brief explanations by Messrs. Davis, Packard, Frasier,
                                    Bingham, Smith of Bartholomew, Ford, Bundy, Dobbins, Cason,
                                    Grain, McLean, Newman, Cooprider, Davis, Nebeker, Brett,
                                    Heffren, Parrett, Black, Moorman, and others -
                                On motion by Mr. HEFFREN, it was considered as engrossed, ordered
                                    to the third reading, read the third time and passed - by yeas
                                    74, nays Messrs. Combs, Davis, Horton, Packard, and Polk - with
                                    an amendment of title, inserting the words: "Providing for
                                    courts martial and councils of administration; making an
                                    appropriation for the support of the militia, and declaring an
                                    emergency for the immediate taking effect of this act.
                                Ordered, That the clerk acquaint the Senate
                                    thereof.
                                Mr. MOSS submitted an order directing the Doorkeeper to procure
                                    $3 worth of postage stamps for each member of the House of
                                    Representatives to be paid for out of the appropriation for the
                                    expenses of the General Assembly: which was adopted.
                                And then the House adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            FRIDAY, May 3, 1861.
                        
                        Mr. HAMILTON presented a lengthy memorial on national affairs, which was
                            read and referred to the Committee on Federal
                                Relations.
                        
                            DEFINING FELONY.
                            Mr. WOLFE, from the Judiciary Committee, returned
                                Senator Cravens'bill [5] recommending the substitution of Senator
                                Miller's bill [4] in lieu thereof.
                            Mr. WAGNER moved to concur in the committee report, with the
                                following amendment in section 1 line 7 after the words "United
                                States," by adding these words: "or who have refused to comply with
                                the requisition of the President of the United States for forces in
                                putting down the present rebellion, or have furnished or permitted
                                to be furnished, recruits for the army of the Confederate
                                States."
                            Mr. SLAC. That is a kind of a small declaration of war against
                                Kentucky.
                            Mr. WAGNER. If the State of Kentucky is in rebellion against the
                                Government of the United States, I can't help it. Why don't the
                                people of Kentucky furnish their quota of regiments to the
                                President? Why, they are absolutely sending troops to destroy this
                                Government; and I call upon every gentleman to put himself upon the
                                record as to whether he regards Kentucky or Missouri as being in
                                rebellion to the country.
                            Mr. LANDERS. I would ask whether Kentucky is not now furnishing some
                                men to the United States army?
                            Mr. WAGNER The Senator has no official information of that fact.
                            Mr. MELLETT. I can not support the amendment offered, and thereby
                                declare every citizen in Kentucky a rebel to the Government of the
                                United States. I do not think we ought to pass a law contemplating
                                anything of the kind. I understand, for instance, that loyal
                                citizens in  western Virginia
                                are trying to put down rebellion, and are calling for assistance
                                from Union-loving men; now, if this amendment prevailed, we would
                                not have the right to furnish these people with arms, munitions of
                                war or provisions. I am satisfied that Governor Magoffin is a
                                secessionist, but I do not know how many Union men, as good as we
                                are, are in Kentucky. Suppose that three-fourths of the people were
                                loyal, Governor Magoffin would have the same power then that he
                                assumes now; but the fact that he is a rebel is not sufficient cause
                                for us to declare every citizen in Kentucky a rebel.
                            Mr. WAGNER. The city of Louisville is today making a fortune out of
                                sending munitions of war and food to the Southern troops, and that
                                provision comes from Indiana more than all the other States put
                                together. Men from the Southern Confederacy, men from Jeff. Davis'
                                army are buying there every day of their lives; and we are
                                indirectly feeding the army that we are taxing our people to put
                                down.
                            Mr. MELLETT. We have no power, as a State, to declare war against
                                Kentucky; and so far as I know we have no cause of war against the
                                State of Kentucky. The effect of the amendment is to declare all
                                citizens of Kentucky alien enemies. It is the duty of the Government
                                of the United States to punish treason and suppress rebellion
                                wherever it may exist within its limits, and it is equally its duty
                                to protect its loyal citizens wherever they may be found, against
                                the violence of rebels and traitors. The loyal citizens of Kentucky
                                have the same right to protection from the Government that the
                                citizens of Indiana have, notwithstanding their Governor may be
                                aiding and abetting the rebellion against the Government.
                            Mr. WOLFE. I am sorry a discussion has come up on this bill this
                                morning. I hoped that when the committee had made an almost
                                unanimous report we would act upon it in the Senate with a degree of
                                unanimity. I endorse every sentiment uttered by the Senator from
                                Henry on this question. I never will vote for a law which will
                                prevent me or my constituents from furnishing aid and comfort to
                                Union men in any of these States.
                            Mr. STEELE. I think this bill is about as good a one as can be got up
                                under the circumstances, and I think the amendment of the Senator
                                from Warren [Mr. Wagner] is a little too strenuous. I was looking at
                                it to see whether I was not one of those men alluded to that would
                                be guilty of the crime of treason. I have been guilty, and my
                                friends with me, of selling a large amount of hay that is going
                                South, and I have no doubt that same hay will be used in feeding the
                                horses and cattle of the South.
                            SEVERAL SENATORS. You are included.
                            Mr. STEELE. Then the only way I can get out of the scrape is to stop
                                shipping hay; and I will stop it right away. [Laughter.] I am not
                                prepared to defend Gov. Magoffin, for I think he has acted
                                improperly; but he has required the Legislature of Kentucky to be
                                convened next Monday, and that is as soon as he could convene them;
                                for the Constitution of Kentucky requires so many days to interrene
                                between the sessions. Now I regard this amendment as almost
                                declaring war against the State of Kentucky. I tell you, as I said
                                the other day, we have thousands of friends in Kentucky who are in
                                favor of supporting that flag. Put that amendment there and it would
                                show that we are almost in open hostility and ready to declare war
                                against the State of Kentucky. The Governor is only one man in the
                                State of Kentucky, and there is people enough there to control
                                him.
                            Mr. ANTHONY spoke in opposition to the amendment.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON. I am astonished at the anxiety of the Senator from
                                Warren [Mr. Wagner] to take into the hands of the State what
                                naturally belongs to the government of the United States, when we
                                are neither invaded or threatened with invasion. If we pass such a
                                bill as this, it ought to be a moderate one; for I apprehend such
                                legislation is of doubtful constitutionality. It seems to be the
                                object of the amendment to declare war between two States, by
                                restricting commerce. The Constitution of the United States
                                delegates to Congress alone the power to regulate commerce between
                                the States. I move to lay the amendment on the table.
                            The motion was agreed to by yeas 37, nays 6.
                            The report was then concurred in and the substitute was adopted.
                            On motion by Mr. MELLETT, the bill wag considered as engrossed, read
                                the third time, and finally passed by yeas 40, nays 3.
                        
                        
                            ABSENCE.
                            Mr. COBB asked and obtained leave of absence for Mr. Shoemaker called
                                home by a dispatch announcing the death of his child.
                        
                        
                            THE STATE LOAN.
                            On motion by Mr. STUDABAKER, the loan bill [H. 22] (described on page
                                33 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS,) was taken from the files and
                                read the first time.
                            On motion by Mr. LINE, under a dispensation of the rules - yeas 40,
                                nays 0 - the bill was read the second time by title only and
                                referred to the Committee on Finance; with
                                instruction by Mr. LANDERS to inquire into the expediency of
                                striking out "2,000,000" and inserting "1,000,000."
                        
                        
                            THE MILITIA.
                            On motion by Mr. BLAIR, the militia bill [H. 21] (the rules being
                                suspender - yeas 40, nays 0 for that purpose,) was read the first
                                and second times by title only and referred to the
                                    Committee on Military Affairs.
                            And then came the recess till 2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            On motion by Mr. ODELL, a resolution was adopted in these words:
                                "That the House be requested to return to the Senate the House
                                resolution providing for the adjournment of the Legislature from
                                this (Friday) evening over to the 21st instant, and amended by the
                                Senate so as to adjourn to the 16th inst.

                            Mr. SLACK offered the following joint resolution [S 5.):
                            
                            A joint resolution inviting the members of the Kentucky Legislature
                                to visit the Capital of the State of Indiana:
                            WHEREAS, Difficulties have arisen between many of the States of this
                                Union and the Government of the United States, in consequence of
                                which open acts of hostility have been and are being enacted:
                            AND WHEREAS, The people of Indiana always have, and it is to be hoped
                                ever will entertain the kindest and most affectionate regard for the
                                citizens and patriots of Kentucky:

                                self-sacrificing patriotism which actuated them in days gone by,
                                when the soil of Indiana and the homes and firesides of her citizens
                                were defended and protected by the best blood of Kentucky:
                            AND WHEREAS hitherto the relations between the citizens of the State
                                of'Kentucky and Indiana have been such that every patriotic citizen
                                must deplore any disturbance thereof, and for the purpose of
                                testifying to Kentucky the disposition on the part of the people of
                                Indiana to continue and maintain the kind and patriotic relations

                                            General Assembly of the State of Indiana, at the city of
                                            Indianapolis, to be received and entertained as the

                                    adopted.

                                GOVERNOR'S CONTINGENT FUND.

                                So the amendment was laid on the table.
                                Mr. CLAYPOOL offered the following amendment: "Except in such
                                    cases where the same may be deemed inexpedient by the Governor,
                                    but that he shall keep a detailed account thereof, and report to
                                    the ensuing General Assembly all disbursements by him made out

                                    Reports - recommending concurrence in the House amendments
                                    thereto.

                                THEE COMMISSARY GENERAL.
                                Mr. CLAYPOOL submitted the following report: The select committee
                                    to whom was referred the answer of the Commissary General of the
                                    Indiana Militia to the resolution of the Senate of the 29th of
                                    April, 1861, have had the same under consideration, and have had
                                    said Commissary General before said committee, and requested him
                                    to furnish a detailed statement of the articles purchased and
                                    from whom, with the prices attached, which was promptly
                                    furnished by said Commissary, and which was and is deemed a full
                                    compliance with said resolution. Said statement is herewith
                                    submitted. Your committee have directed me to report that they
                                    find that the Commissary has kept the affairs in his department
                                    in a correct and business-like manner, and that his purchases
                                    seem to have been made with care and discretion, and as cheap as
                                    they could reasonably have been made under the exigencies of the
                                    times; but inasmuch as the press of immediate purchases has
                                    passed away that a law be passed requiring all articles to be
                                    purchased by giving notice and receiving sealed bids
                                    therefor.
                            
                            
                                CORPORATE AUTHORITIES DEFENSE BILL.
                                Mr. MELLETT, from the Committee on Mili  tary Affairs,
                                    returned the bill [H. 3] - see pages 12 and 18 of these reports
                                    - reporting that it embraces the same subject, but is not so
                                    perfect, in the opinion of the committee, as the bill which hag
                                    already passed the Senate, and recommend that it be laid upon
                                    the table.
                                The report was concurred in.
                            
                            
                                COUNTY AND TOWN DEFENSE BILL.
                                Mr. WOLFE, from the Committee on Military
                                        Affairs, returned the volunteer aid bill [H. 6] -
                                    see pages 18, 33 and 34 of these reports - recommending that it
                                    lie on the table, for the reason that the Senate has already
                                    passed a bill on the same subject, the provisions of which meet
                                    the approbation of the committee more fully than this bill.
                                The report was concurred in.
                                Mr. STUDABAKER, from the Committee on Finance,
                                    returned a resolution of the Senate directing that committee to
                                    inquire into the expediency of levying a tax sufficient to pay
                                    the annual interest on any bonds that may be sold by the State
                                    for the purpose of raising money to meet the emergency of the
                                    times, recommending the adoption of the following
                                    resolution:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That it is the sense of
                                                this Senate that an additional tax of ten cents on
                                                each one hundred dollars of taxable property in the
                                                State ought to be levied at the present session of
                                                the General Assembly.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. WOLFE moved to concur with an amendment adding these words,
                                    "and an additional poll tax of twenty five cents on each
                                    poll."
                                The report was concurred in and the resolution, as amended,
                                    adopted.

                                Mr. LINE. Mr. President: The Committee on
                                        Education, to whom was referred a petition from
                                    citizens in the vicinity of Mount Carmel, Franklin county,
                                    complaining of the decision of the Superintendent of Public
                                    Instruction, under the present school law, preventing persons
                                    from voting in town and cities who have been attached thereto
                                    for school purposes, have directed me to make the following
                                    report: "While your committee admit the justice of the grounds
                                    of complaint of the petitioners, and that it may require
                                    remedial legislation, yet, under a rule adopted by the Senate in
                                    the early part of the session, precluding any legislation during
                                    this special session on any subject except such as should be
                                    recomended by the Governor, they therefore ask to be discharged
                                    from a further consideration of the subject.
                                The report was concurred in.
                            
                            
                                ARTICLES FOR VOLUNTEERS.
                                On motion by Mr. HAMILTON, it was
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, By the Senate, that the

                                                Senate the amount he has purchased for the troops at
                                                Camp Morton; specifying the quantity of each article
                                                purchased, with the price paid for the same, the
                                                persons from whom purchases are made, and whether by
                                                private or public contract, and whether vouchers are
                                                taken from the persons to whom they were
                                                delivered.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                And then came a recess till 7 1/2 o'clock.
                            
                        
                        
                            NIGHT SESSION.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL, from the Committee on Finance,
                                returned his bill, [S. 17] introduced day before yesterday, with a
                                substitute therefor, recommending passage.

                                inserting "seven."

                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            FRIDAY, May 3, 1861.
                        
                        On motion by Mr. GIFFORD, the reading of the journal of yesterday was
                            dispensed with.
                        
                            MISSION TO KENTUCKY.
                            Mr. JENKINSON submitted a joint resolution. It was read as
                                follows:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, &c., That three members
                                            of the House, to be selected by the House, and two
                                            members of the Senate, to be selected by the Senate, be
                                            and they are hereby appointed a committee to visit
                                            Frankfort, Kentucky, at the meeting of the Kentucky
                                            Legislature, and to confer on the present crisis with
                                            the Legislature of Kentucky and assure the Union men of
                                            Kentucky of our cordial support of their endeavors to
                                            preserve that gallant old State in the Union, and to
                                            prevent the Tennessee troops from crossing her borders
                                            to invade the State of Illinois at Cairo.
                                    
                                
                            
                            He wanted the State of Indiana to hold out the olive branch, and to
                                give to patriotic old Kentucky the opportunity to say to Gen. Gid.
                                Pillow that he can't come over the soil of Kentucky with an invading
                                force. This resolution should pass unanimously, and these men should
                                go down next week and tell them what Indiana wants; that we
                                sympathize, that we will do anything that is honorable for peace;
                                that their mission is for peace and the preservation of the Union.
                                And then, after that, if they compel us to fight, God save the
                                hindmost. [Laughter.]
                            Mr. BUNDY regretted the introduction of the resolution at this
                                juncture. There was one resolution already in the hands of a
                                committee of five. That committee have not reported, but will,
                                perhaps, to-day or to-morrow. Whether I go for. this resolution or
                                not, I do not think we ought to be in too great haste to pass it. I
                                will move that  it be referred
                                to that committee of five. It is highly important, Mr. Speaker, that
                                the subject matter of this resolution should be carefully considered
                                and matured before its passage.
                            Mr. JENKINSON did not see the necessity of delay. He wanted these men
                                appointed at once. They should go over next week and take the
                                resolution along with them, and arm themselves with the sentiment of
                                the resolution, and with what personal friendship they may find -
                                let them go over and see what Kentucky intends to do. And if there
                                should be no disposition for peace, then shut down on them - cut off
                                at once all trade and supplies of provisions on the part of this
                                State.
                            Mr. ORR loved all Union men. But had not Kentucky refused to respond
                                to the call of the President for men ? and had not the Governor of
                                Kentucky refused to attend his own appointments for a conference of
                                adjustment? and did not the telegraph inform us this morning that a
                                party of Kentucky secessionists had made a hostile attack on parties
                                of Union men - Indianians and Kentuckians.
                            Mr. JENKINSON. I want gentlemen to show their hands.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN (Mr. Sherman in the Chair) said he was as ready to
                                show his hand as any man, to the State of Kentucky or any other
                                State - that it was for the defense of this Union, the support of
                                the Constitution and the enforcement of the laws. [Applause.]
                            Mr. JENKINSON would let the gentleman from Knox know that the
                                majority of Kentucky were for the Union.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN. The gentleman from Knox does not know that, nor
                                does the gentleman from Allen himself. If the majority there were
                                Union men, would they not find a remedy to prevent the formation of
                                marauding bands to invade our border? If the Governor of Kentucky
                                were loyal, would he stand by and permit the enlistment of men in
                                Kentucky to go and fight for the the Southern
                                Confederates? These things would not be suffered if the gentleman
                                from Alien is correct. There is one thing with reference to these
                                resolutions and all resolutions of this character that have been
                                offered in this House. Why should Indiana get on her knees to
                                Kentucky to assure them that we are friendly? Why should we go over
                                there and beg them not to invade the State of Illinois? I apprehend,
                                sir, that Indiana and Illinois are quite as ready to repel invasion
                                as the State of Kentucky or the State of Tennessee are to make
                                invasion. But, forsooth, we must go and beg them not to invade us;
                                not to permit the Tennesseeans to come over! Who does not know that
                                if Kentucky is loyal she will not permit them to cross her border?
                                We have already told Kentucky and the world where we stand. We stand
                                on the Constitution. We stand for the defense of the Union. We have
                                responded to the call of the President of the United States for
                                troops, the object of which is the preservation of the Union, the
                                enforcement of the laws and the punishment of traitors. [Applause.]
                                There is where we stand: and if Kentucky does not want to meet us on
                                that ground, we don't want to meet Kentucky at all. Does the
                                gentleman want to place us injudiciously in alliance with Kentucky?
                                Does he want to place Indiana in a position of rebellion against the
                                Union? Are we so craven as to get down on our knees and beg Kentucky
                                not to invade us? I hope the State of Indiana is not so far gone as
                                to do that. I noticed, with regret, an attack in a morning's paper
                                upon Governor Morton, with reference to his correspondence with the
                                Governor of Kentucky, charging him with agreeing to do that which he
                                had no power to do, and guilty of a treasonable act by consenting to
                                meet the Governor of Kentucky and talk over the exigencies of the
                                crisis. This charge is made when it is known that Governor Morton
                                expressly declared that he was ready to unite with the Governor of
                                Kentucky, on any plan for the support of the Constitution, that
                                would be honorable to the State of Indiana. As for these
                                resolutions, Mr. Speaker, in the face of this slight of the Governor
                                of Kentucky, we are urged to select five men, members of this
                                legislature, to beg them not to let Tennessee troops come against
                                us. Sir, I say let them come, if they will; and if they do come we
                                will endeavor to give them such a reception that they will desire
                                never to come again. I hope sir, that the resolution will be tabled
                                at once; and if secessionists want to come in a hostile way, let
                                them come; and let us prepare to give them a fitting reception.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Bartholomew, could not forbear saying a word for the
                                Union men of Kentucky. Had not the Union men, once before this,
                                overcome the secession efforts of Governor Magoffin and might they
                                not do so again? He believed it would appear now soon, that a
                                majority of the people of Kentucky are Union men. Their Legislature
                                were to convene soon. The secession candidates for their convention,
                                had withdrawn from the contest.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN. Were they conditional or unconditional Union
                                men?
                            Mr. SMITH. They were just such Union men as he (Mr. Smith.) They
                                would not invade the soil of any other State with a hostile
                                purpose.
                            Mr. PARRETT. This Legislature had passed conciliatory resolutions,
                                and they had been scoffed at in Kentucky. They had received no other
                                attention at their hands, and he did not feel like going any further
                                in that direction. There was one of the Southern States that would
                                stay in the Union why? Because the United States troops are about
                                them, and they are compelled to be Union men at the cannon's
                                mouth,and that was the way now to make Union men of all of them.
                            He called attention to an article in the Sentinel
                                of this morning, making a stab at the efforts of this Legislature to
                                support the Union. [He read the second paragraph of the Sentinel's leader, May 3d, and objected to the spirit of
                                the whole of the article.]
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. What particular fault does the gentleman find with
                                the article?
                            Mr. PARRETT. The whole spirit of the article but illy disguises its
                                opposition to Mr. Lincoln's policy to put down rebellion, and the
                                propositions to aid him before this General Assembly. It says war is
                                expensive.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. If that is objectionable, what would be the same
                                kind of financial  calculation
                                made on this floor? Would that be opposition to the Government?
                            Mr.PARRETT. Not by a jug full. [Laughter.]
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. What's the difference?
                            Mr. PARRETT. I call the gentleman's attention to this sentence: "And
                                this is only a beginning of the cost, if it is the policy of the
                                Administration to prosecute a war of aggression and subjugation upon
                                the South." What is the object of this?
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Down the column is an article from the New
                                    York Tribune worse than that.
                            Mr. PARRETT. It means that, unless we abandon this resistance and
                                submit to traitors, the people will have to pay oppressive taxes.
                                That is what it means. It is the spirit in which the article was
                                written that I look at. I do not care what the Tribune has said.
                            Mr. DOBBINS. The resolution is before the House, and not the Sentinel. I suppose we ought to expect newspapers
                                to say what they please about our actions.
                            Mr.PARRETT. Yes. What he said was, that there should be no more
                                temporizing. If our home men will support the invaders from the
                                South, we will say what we please about them here.
                            Mr. GRESHAM. Two months ago he was called a sort of a submissionist,
                                but there were times when submission would not answer. We knew well
                                enough what would be the result of the proposed mission to Kentucky.
                                Our only policy now was to maintain the Government vigorously. War
                                was inevitable. The slave States would all go out. Compromise was
                                out of the question. Every effort in that direction on our part
                                would be credited only to our fears. It would not look well, when
                                war is made on the Federal Government, for us here to make overtures
                                of peace. No. Let us maintain the Government. Let us make this war
                                terrible to those who have invoked it, and so make it profitable as
                                a lesson to all. He showed the sheer folly of the assumed neutrality
                                of the State of Kentucky. It was a sort of quasi
                                partnership with the Jeff. Davis concern. The soil of Kentucky was
                                no better than that of Indiana, and nothing in the power of any
                                loyal State to offer, should be withheld or denied for the support
                                of the Government of the United State and the enforcement of the
                                laws. The only course is to go on and execute every order and
                                enforce every decree of the General Government. He had friends and
                                interests in Kentucky, but he was not going to get down on his knees
                                before them and beg that he might live.
                            (A message from the Governor, by Mr. Holloway, his private secretary,
                                was here announced transmitting a communication from the directors
                                of the Northern Prison.)
                            Mr. DOBBINS considered it unnecessary to act on the resolution. The
                                best way to rebuke treason and put down rebellion, was to present an
                                unbroken front for the support and maintenance of the Constitution
                                and the Union. All that is necessary to be done here was indicated
                                in the joint resolution that came from the Senate the other day. He
                                deprecated all notice here of the discussions in the newspapers, and
                                defended the freedom of speech and the press. He referred to the
                                treasonable correspondence between Jeff. Davis and one of his
                                constituents, the discovery of which resulted in sending the
                                individual out of the State.
                            Mr. JENKINSON agreed with the gentleman from Knox in one matter - he
                                regretted with him the attack of the Sentinel upon
                                the course of Governor Morton. He had heard no valid reasoning
                                against the peace embassy he had proposed to Frankfort. In
                                opposition to the declaration, that the time for compromise was
                                past, he insisted that the olive branch should always go with the
                                sword. He deprecated everything that looked like striking the Union
                                men of Kentucky, struggling patrioticly against the Amalekites! He
                                had offered the resolution as an American citizen, not as a
                                partizan.
                            Mr. VEATCH thought the gentleman from Allen was mistaken as to the
                                effect it will produce. They will attribute it to the cowardice of
                                the white-livered North. If the Union men in Kentucky are able, they
                                would overcome the secessionists; but if not, could the gentleman
                                suppose that his proposition could be received favorably by the
                                dominant secessionists? He referred to the concession of the
                                honorable Archie Dixon, in his late Union speech at Louisville,
                                telling Kentucky that while she remains in the Union, the North will
                                not invade her; and meanwhile, she can send as many troops as she
                                will to take part with the Confederates. The mission proposed would
                                be repelled with scorn. The idea that the General Government has no
                                right to march troops across a State is a heresy near akin to
                                treason. Who talks about invading Kentucky? They know we don't
                                intend to do it. But the laws must be respected and enforced, and
                                the forces of the Government of the United States must be victorious
                                wherever a flag can wave. If Kentucky, if Baltimore stand in the way
                                of the supremacy of the Government, they must be leveled. He
                                regarded the Sentinel's reference to the cost of the war, and
                                characterizing it as a war of aggression, as an error of judgment,
                                &c.
                            Mr. HEFFREN read an extract from the New York
                                    Tribune, in the same paper, characterizing the present as a
                                "war of subjugation," and asked Mr. Veatch if he endorsed it.
                            Mr. VEATCH deprecated war, but a prostrate government was worse. He
                                was willing to reduce them by all means to the necessity of
                                returning to loyalty. If it became necessary to throw a wall around
                                them, and deprive them of food, so that starvation ensue, it was a
                                necessity of government,to result in the public good. "Necessity
                                knows no law." Could we send food and arms for Unionists, and
                                bullets for traitors? No, they must suffer in the mass. Subjugation?
                                "We could not in these times use plain words without a disingenuous
                                interpretation. He meant to subjugate every man in rebellion against
                                the Government. When the rebels lay down their arms as States, then
                                let the State proceed in the exercise of all its constitutional
                                functions.
                            Mr. HOLCOMB. It was plain that the resolu-  tion could not pass, and as time was
                                precious, he would move the previous question.
                            There was a second, and under the force of the demand, the
                                resolutions were referred to the Select Committee of
                                    Five - yeas 58, nays 31.
                        
                        
                            SIX REGIMENT BILL.
                            On motion of Mr. HEFFREN, the six regiment bill, [S. 1] with pending
                                amendments from the Military Committee, was taken
                                up and considered on the second reading.
                            Mr. GRESHAM said: Since the action on this bill the President had
                                made a requisition on the Governor of the State of Indiana for six
                                regiments more, to serve three years, and therefore he wanted the
                                sense of the House on the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That said bill be recommitted
                                            to the Committee on Military Affairs,
                                            with instructions to report the same back to the House
                                            with amendments, providing for raising live regiments to
                                            serve for twelve months, for the defense of the State of
                                            Indiana.
                                    
                                
                            
                            He wanted the sense of the House on this question, whether we will
                                raise a force of our own, and put it on pay - to be kept within our
                                own borders.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN preferred the consideration of this bill in its
                                present shape. It was impossible for us to avoid the sacrifices and
                                horrors of the present war Ohio, Indiana and Illinois were perhaps
                                to be the battle-field. The troops collected here were yet
                                unorganized and almost mutinous, and something ought to be done to
                                relieve the Governor from the responsibility of calling them out, as
                                well as for the purposes of defense.
                            Mr. FRASIER concurred in these views, and targed them upon the
                                attention of the House. He did not fear that the people of Indiana
                                would fail to sustain any action here which is necessary to place
                                the State in her proper position in the present national emergency.
                                His position was, that if this thing required $10,000,000, he would
                                be ready to vote it. What were dollars against the security, the
                                interests and honor of our country and her flag.
                            Mr. GRESHAM now withdrew his resolution.
                            The bill and proposed amendments reported from the Committee
                                    on Military Affairs were read by the Clerk.
                            Mr. FISHER moved that the House refuse to concur in the proposition
                                to raise a regiment of cavalry.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG inquired as to the probable cost of carrying out the
                                bill.
                            Mr. FISHER. He had called upon a gentleman who was amply competent to
                                make the estimate, but had not yet got his estimate. It was certain,
                                if the President's second requisition was not already made, it would
                                be made in less than twenty days. The keeping of troops for home
                                defense was not the only question. If these troops were not called
                                for in sixty days, it would be all the better for them in the way of
                                discipline.
                            In the name of humanity, should we not be willing to bear the
                                necessary expense of drill to qualify them to meet the emergency?
                                Where was the wisdom or the economy of sending men to battle with
                                wooden swords and corn-stalk muskets? The bill provided that this
                                cavalry regiment should not be mounted. This was like going to war
                                without weapons. It was impossible to drill cavalry without
                                horses.
                            Mr. KNOWLTON and Mr. HEFFREN said they could be instructed in cavalry
                                tactics without horse.
                            Mr. FISHER had been reliably informed that the estimates at
                                Washington of the expense of subsisting troops were one million a
                                year for each regiment of infantry, and a million and a half for a
                                regiment of cavalry. He insisted upon drill. Our troops would be
                                called into the United States service in less than 60 days.
                            Mr. PROSSER spoke in favor of retaining the cavalry clause, and the
                                necessity of the presence of cavalry on our Southern border. If we
                                organize for defense or offense, let us have those cavalry and
                                artillery organizations which will be efficient to the field. Let us
                                not leave ourselves exposed to the forays of horsemen, but let horse
                                meet horse. The 6th section should provide for the regiment going
                                into the service of ''the State" as well as the General
                                Government
                            Mr. GRESHAM desired immediate action.
                            Mr STOTSENBERG. Were these troops intended for State service until
                                called for by the General Government? Had not the President called
                                for six regiments more? and could not the men at Camp Morton be
                                accepted under that call?
                            Mr. HEFFREN. If they choose. He understood that this was a war of
                                common defense. These six regiments were to be transferred to the
                                General Government when called for. The cavalry were enlisted for
                                and during the war. We must have cavalry. What would become of
                                infantry against a flying force of artillery and horse? This battle,
                                as the gentleman from Knox (Mr. Speaker Allen) had observed, was to
                                be fought on these plains of ours, and we expect to stand here and
                                receive the aid of the North. What could be done with 75,000
                                infantry? You might as well talk about knocking in the walls of
                                Gibralter with your fist, as to think of defending the Southern
                                border of those States north of the Ohio river with infantry alone.
                                He deprecated counting the cost, or stopping to question who is to
                                blame, but exhorted all to stand together as patriots and brothers
                                in the common defense.
                            Mr. CRAIN. It seemed to him that the bill was to organize these
                                regiments and hold them under drill for the service of the United
                                States. Now we have passed a bill for the formation of infantry and
                                cavalry indefinitely, for home defense. The way to protect the
                                border was to organize under that militia bill. The southern border
                                and all the people must prepare on their own hook. And if there
                                should not be men enough on the border for the purposes of
                                defense,the Center and North must go down and help them.
                            Mr. PROSSER. How could we organize without guns? But if we had a
                                regiment of horse we could be readily equipped as cavalry. In the
                                east the Government has abundance of cavalry equipments out of
                                use
                            Mr. CRAIN referred to the bills for $500,000 worth of arms, and for
                                sending 5,000 stand of arms to the southern border, and repeated the
                                necessity for home organization in every quarter, and our duty to
                                put infantry under drill. He would not cut off the cavalry if the
                                General Gov-regiment should not be mounted. This was like eminent
                                should call for it.
                            
                            Mr. KNOWLTON. The Governor had tendered a regiment of cavalry.
                            Mr. GRAIN considered the place for this cavalry was in the southern
                                counties, where he understood they were now organizing.
                            Mr. HOLCOMB demanded the previous question, and under its operation,
                                the main question, viz: Shall the cavalry clause in the amendments
                                be stricken out? was decided in the negative - yeas 29, nays 56.
                            Mr. McLEAN moved to concur in the amendments of the committee, with
                                the following amendment:
                            Amend by striking out from the first section the words: "the Governor
                                be authorized to call into the active service of the State," and
                                inserting in lieu these words: "the Governor be authorized and
                                empowered, in his discretion whenever the exigencies of the country
                                may require, in order to provide for a more perfect defense, to call
                                into the actual service," &c.
                            Here the House took a recess till two o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            Mr. Stotsenberg's execution stay bill [23] and his real estate
                                redemption bill [29,] Mr. Williams' appraisement relief bill [27]
                                were severally read the second time and referred to the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary; and Mr.
                                Kendrick's Lunatic Asylum bill was ordered to be engrossed.
                            Mr. HOLCOMB, from the select committee thereon, reported on the order
                                of enlistment and acceptance of the several companies now in camp,
                                as they were accepted by telegraph by the Adjutant General.
                            On motion by Mr. BINGHAM, it was made the special order for to-morrow
                                at ten o'clock.

                            
                                SIX REGIMENT BILL.
                                The House resumed the six regiment bill.
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN, (Mr. Nebeker in the chair,) directed a few
                                    words to the amendment of Mr. McLean. The amendment vests in the
                                    Governor a discretionary power. The time to repel invasion was
                                    on us. He was opposed, at such a time, to devolving on the
                                    Governor any responsibility properly devolving on the General
                                    Assembly. He did not want to shield himself behind the act of
                                    the Governor. It was known that there were organized armed bands
                                    in every town in Kentucky on our Southern border. There was a
                                    gentleman on this floor who had a letter informing him that this
                                    marauding process had already been commenced in the town of
                                    Mount Vernon; though there was on the same night about as much
                                    mischief done on the opposite side of the river. A Kentucky
                                    agent was now in the South after arms, and was to receive 25,000
                                    stand from Louisiana and 10,000 from Mississippi. The time then
                                    had fully come for us to prepare to repel invasion, and so, it
                                    may be, prevent invasion by the preparation for it. He hoped the
                                    amendment would not prevail.
                                On motion of Mr. DOBBINS, the amendment was laid on the table,
                                    and the question recurred on concurring in the amendments of the
                                    committee to the first section of the bill.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG demanded the previous question, and, under its
                                    operation, the committee's amendment for "seven" regiments
                                    instead of "six" was rejected. The amendment making the term of
                                    enlistment "three" years instead of "one" was adopted. The next
                                    amendment of the committee authorizing a regiment of cavalry was
                                    rejected. The amendment of the committee to the first section,
                                    giving preference to companies from counties which have not
                                    furnished troops, was also adopted.
                                The amendment for one Brigadier General was adopted.
                                The amendment giving commissioned officers the pay of their grade
                                    the same as officers in the service of the United States was
                                    rejected full debate. The bill allows three-quarters pay.
                                The 5th section being under consideration -
                                Mr. FERGUSON made an ineffectual motion to insert "no pay"
                                    instead of "half pay," as the bill provides.
                                The 6th section being under consideration -
                                Mr. FRASIER could not see how cavalry could be trained without
                                    horses. He remembered the famous saying that the spurs of
                                    cavalry were more important that their swords. How could they
                                    drill without being mounted? He was unable to see any good
                                    purpose to be accomplished by calling out an unmounted regiment
                                    of horse. He was unwilling by any act of his to expose our
                                    recruits to be called into the field to be slaughtered.
                                Mr. EDSON proposed to amend the committee's amendment by striking
                                    out all in the 6th section after the word "equipped," viz:
                                The cavalry shall be enlisted for and during the war, unless
                                    sooner discharged, and shall be selected from those cavalry
                                    companies which have been tendered as such for the war, in the
                                    order in which their services have been offered.
                                He spoke at length against the preference to those who had
                                    tendered services. There were cavalry companies formed and
                                    forming in the border counties, which this provision would cut
                                    out entirely. They furnished their own horses. This day he had a
                                    letter from his county reporting lawless attacks in the night by
                                    robbers from Kentucky, upon defenseless parties for the purpose
                                    of plunder and murder, at three or four points in the same
                                    night. Here was a necessity for a cavalry organization already
                                    upon us.
                                The amendment was adopted - affirmative 40, negative 29.
                                Mr. HEFFREN now moved that the bill and pending amendments be
                                    indefinitely postponed.
                                The motion was rejected - affirmative 25, negative 45.
                                Mr. FISHER. When the amendments to the first section of the bill
                                    were under consideration I moved to strike out that which
                                    relates to a caralry regiment. I think now that would be an
                                    improvement to the bill. But the House has expressed itself in
                                    favor of a regiment of cavalry, and it ill-becomes me to oppose
                                    it now. I must be content and acquiesce in the judgment of the
                                    House. And I am sorry to see gentlemen, the friends of a cavalry
                                    regiment, so much disturbed on account of the amendment to the
                                    6th section as to move the indefinite postponement of the bill.
                                    They would see, on reflection, that they have carried the thing
                                    a little to far. He wanted to see an accommodation between the
                                    friends and opposers of cavalry here - both parties to yield
                                    something.
                                Mr. HEFFREN did not suppose that any man
                            
                        
                    
                
                
                

                    BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS,
                    BY ARIEL, & W. H. DRAPIER.
                    
                        Vol. V.
                        INDIANAPOLIS, MAY 9, 1861.
                        NO. 5.
                    
                    
                        
                            would desire to go into a cavalry regiment, either as a private or as
                                an officer, at three-fourths the pay granted to other men in the
                                service. When I fight, I fight for my country. But I desire when I
                                go out and stand shoulder to shoulder with other men, to fight a
                                common cause, against a, common foe, to have the same remuneration
                                that others get coming from other quarters.
                            Mr. FISHER. I presume the House would be willing to give full pay to
                                those in actual service. The three-quarters pay is for those in camp
                                for drill - not in actual service.
                            Mr. JENKINSON. It is the State service.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I know no difference between fighting for my State and
                                the United States. The artillery as well as the cavalry was the life
                                of this system. Half a dozen companies of flying artillery and one
                                company of cavalry would do more on the border than all the rest in
                                the bill. The three quarters pay would destroy the bill, and until
                                the commissioned officers were placed on an equality with those in
                                the service of the United States, in this respect, he must vote
                                against the bill.
                            Mr. PARRETT. This matter is "confusion worse confounded." Some
                                understand the bill that it is raising troops for the United States,
                                as so soon as the requisition shall be had by the President, on this
                                assumption all that is said with reference to these regiments
                                defending the border is all nonsense. Another portion of the House
                                take the bill to read that it is to raise State troops for three
                                years. And now I submit, if it is susceptible of both these
                                constructions is it such a bill as is required by the emergencies of
                                the State? On the assumption that it is a bill to raise troops for
                                the protection of the border, is it a proper bill? If it is to
                                protect the border, it ought to be a bill providing for two
                                regiments of cavalry, for they do not want infantry there. Six
                                regiments of infantry would just go down there and eat them out -
                                that's all they could do. But they want two or three regiments of
                                cavalry. But now let us have a bill that we can understand. I am as
                                keen for war as any man on this floor; but I do say, we ought to put
                                it down clearly in our minds whether these troops are for the State
                                or for the United States. I want a bill that admits of no double
                                construction. Why, if they are to be kept here three years, what do
                                we want of these regiments of infantry?
                            Mr. JENKINSON. To draw their pay.
                            Mr. PARRETT. I think so. And "if they are for the service of the
                                United States, what can we expect for these cavalry?
                            Mr. PROSSER. If they are to be turned over to the General Government,
                                would it not be our duty to raise six regiments more?
                            Mr. PARRETT. Just so. If they are for the United States army the bill
                                is a deception ad to the object sought by the men on the border.
                                Then I ask again, what are we doing? I'll tel you how this confusion
                                arose - and it's in the minds of all the members. The bill was, in
                                part, framed to provide for the troops that have come here to
                                Indianapolis, and in endeavoring to make that provision we forgot to
                                designate what they were for. Now if the cavalry is for the border,
                                let us say so. If this infantry is for the United States, let us say
                                so.
                            Mr. FOSTER. Does not the bill clearly define and say that they shall
                                be turned over by the Governor to the United States, whenever the
                                President shall require them?
                            Mr. PARRETT. Then away goes our cavalry, and if they don't make the
                                requisition then I suppose they don't go. [Laughter.] I tell you,
                                sir, I'll have the thing stated so I shall know what I am voting
                                for, or I'll vote against the bill.
                            Mr. EDSON proposed to amend the bill by inserting in the 15th line of
                                the first section these words: "For the protection of the persons
                                and property of the citizens of the State;" and these words: "As the
                                Governor in his discretion may determine." The amendment, he said,
                                is to provide that the troops raised under the provisions of this
                                act are for the purpose of repelling invasions in this State, and if
                                the President makes a requisition to place it in the discretion of
                                the Governor to say whether they are to go or not.
                            The amendment was rejected.
                            Mr. BUNDY proposed to amend by adding to the first section:
                            Provided, That the troops herein provided for shall
                                be held in readiness and turned over to the United States whenever
                                required; and it is expressly understood that they are not to be
                                supplied by others.
                            We certainly ought to know whether these troops are to be held for
                                the State service, or whether they are to be held for the service of
                                the United States. I must say, Mr. Speaker, that I am voting for
                                this bill with the expectation and understanding that there either
                                is now or shortly will be a requisition for the troops to be raised
                                under it; and so, I believe, a large majority here are voting. Are
                                we voting that these six regiments are to be kept here three years
                                at the expense of the State? No, sir; we expect they will be turned
                                over to the United States service. We provided yesterday for the
                                organization of the militia of the State of Indiana. I voted for the
                                most efficient militia bill I could get, for the defense of  the interior - every part of
                                the State - I know no distinction between sections. But I know that
                                if this rebellion is not suppressed there will be a demand for
                                troops for the service of the United States; and I want these troops
                                turned over to that service, and I want no mistake about it.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN. (Mr. Nebeker in the Chair.) My object is, by this
                                bill, to provide for the defense of the State. The gentleman, living
                                where he does, may fold his arms in a feeling of security. But I
                                know there is a necessity for defense. I know that it is necessary
                                to have forces on the border - that it is necessary to have a force
                                there to anticipate and prevent invasion by its presence, or to
                                repel invasion if it came. That is what I see and know for myself.
                                The gentleman will pardon me when I say he is unmindful of his duty
                                to his fellow-citizens on the border, when he refuses to vote the
                                means for their protection. Is it possible that we are getting up
                                six regiments here for the protection of Indiana, when they are to
                                be turned over, perhaps, tomorrow morning into the service of the
                                United States? Is there really a diversity of opinion as to the
                                object of this bill? I thought it was announced at the outset that
                                the object was to provide means for the protection of the State
                                against invasion. I thought that had been announced till no
                                gentleman could doubt it
                            .Mr. BUNDY. Has it not been argued here that they should be turned
                                over to the General Government?
                            Mr. ALLEN. I have heard gentlemen so argue, but, the bill will not
                                bear that construction. The only construction that can be placed
                                upon it is, that the Governor may, in his discretion, do so; or he
                                may call again for volunteers. But I have never yet dreamed that the
                                troops should be taken out of the State unless others were
                                immediately provided in their place. But the gentleman from Henry
                                puts the lives and property of the people in one end of the scale
                                and dollars and cents in, the other, and allows the former to "kick
                                the beam." Sir, I will do anything for the protection of the people
                                of Indiana; if it cost a hundred millions I will do it, where a
                                necessity is admitted, and it will be admitted here by every man who
                                is not blind. I do not stop to count the cost. And I tell every man
                                who does hesitate now, his patriotism is not worth a bauble - a hill of beans, says the gentleman from
                                Washington and Harrison. The amendment offered by the gentleman from
                                Vanderburgh and Posey met my hearty approval. I was perfectly
                                willing to see it declared expressly that these troops were not to
                                be removed from the State. Do gentlemen understand the feeling
                                amongst to people of the State? I say no man here dare go home to
                                his constituents and say he has failed to provide for the protection
                                of the border counties.
                            Mr. BUNDY. Will not the militia bill do that?
                            Mr. ALLEN. For that purpose it is not worth a hill of beans.
                                Gentlemen here may go home, put their wits together and go to work,
                                and they can't organize a legion under it in three months.
                            Mr. JENKINSON. They get the first arms, and we have sent them five
                                thousand muskets.
                            Mr. ALLEN. We get the first distribution of cavalry arms, and five
                                thousand cast off old muskets, changed from the flint-lock piece.
                                Any man might shoot at me 200 yards off with one of them all day. We
                                feel thankful to you, gentlemen from the lakes, for this small
                                favor, but we still ask you to provide for our defense, and for the
                                defense of the State. We urge and demand that every portion of the
                                State shall be put in that position which is necessary for the
                                protection of the lives and property of her citizens; and whenever
                                any gentleman here shall be obliged tell his constituents that he
                                has neglected to do this - that he has neglected to throw upon the
                                border counties a force which shall be sufficient for protecting
                                them, his constituents will say him: You have not been faithful to
                                your trust you have not acted towards others as you would have them
                                act towards you. I hope the bill will prevail, with the amendment of
                                the gentleman from Vanderburg and Posey, notwithstanding the
                                gentleman from Henry says he will not vote for it if it is to supply
                                troops for the service of the State. Let it be declared that this
                                force is to be retained within the limits of the State, and
                                gentlemen can't find any better argument against it than that of quasi patriotism of dollars and cents, they should
                                keep quiet. But if they a satisfied of the necessity that calls for
                                these troops they should vote for the measure, let cost what it may.
                                We are not here for the purpose of counting the cost. We are here
                                for the purpose of providing for the defense of the State, and the
                                people will foot the bill. I am ready to go home and say to the
                                people that I voted for a defense that will cost fifty millions,
                                because the protection of their rights and interests demanded
                                it.
                            Mr. GRESHAM. The author of the bill Wagner of the Senate) had told
                                him that the primary object of the bill was the defense of the
                                State, and if the men raised were yielded to the President others
                                were to supply their places. There was no necessity for passing a
                                bill of this kind to provide for responding to any call of the
                                President for troops. He suggested that the term of three years was
                                long.
                            Mr. BRETT. Was the General Government to give us no aid?
                            Mr. GRESHAM. The United States will remunerate this State for the
                                expense incurred.
                            Mr. KNOWLTON had supported the bill under the belief that these
                                troops were to be turned over to the United States. He understood
                                that the United States could not call for volunteer for so long a
                                period as three years, that it required a State law to call them
                                out. It was the proper business of the General Government to protect
                                every State in the Union. He had been anxious to have the bill acted
                                on. But he should vote against the bill if it was for raising troops
                                exclusively for State purposes.
                            Mr. CAMERON demanded the previous question, and under its operation
                                Mr. Bundy's proposition was rejected - yeas 26, nays 60.
                            Mr. HEFFREN proposed to amend by striking out the sixth section;
                                also, by inserting "cavalry" before "artillery," in line thirteen of
                                section first so that the Governor may divide the regiments into
                                cavalry, artillery or infantry, as he may think best.
                            The amendment was adopted.
                            
                            Mr. SHERMAN moved to amend so as to make the term of service one
                                year, and strike out the words "three fourths" as to pay.
                            Mr. CAMERON demanded the previous question, and under its force the
                                first of these amendments was adopted, on a division. The second
                                amendment was rejected - yeas 33, nays 55.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN had voted for this amendment to give him an
                                opportunity to move a reconsideration. It was strange that the House
                                should make an inviduous distinction against the officers of these
                                regiments. Did gentlemen expect competent military men would take
                                charge of these men under this inviduous distinction.
                            Mr. JENKINSON. Yes.
                            Mr. ALLEN. Yes! they could get men to lead them to dishonor and
                                death. All that is to be saved by this inviduousness is less than
                                $5,000. Who would like to march under men subject to the taunt that
                                they were only "three quarter officers." Were such the officers to
                                repel invasion - to protect our homes and firesides?
                            Mr. JENKINSON confessed that the pay was reduced to defeat the bill.
                                He believed that the bill was got up by ambitious men. The bill was
                                wrong and ought to be voted down. You'll find men enough-able to
                                lead - who will go into this fighting for defense as fast as
                                occasion shall call for them - men, sir, that would not look at
                                $5,000 in the way of compensation for a service.
                            Mr. BUNDY. The question had been decided - two to one - that those
                                officers' should have but three-fourths the pay of the regular army.
                                The reason of this was, they were at home, whilst the officers in
                                the regular service were on the frontier.
                            Mr. GRESHAM demanded the previous question, and under its operation
                                the motion to reconsider was rejected - yeas 33, nays 57.
                            Mr. FISHER proposed to amend the bill by adding a section, viz:
                            SEC.- That when said regiments, or any part thereof, shall be called
                                into actual service, to repel invasion or to protect our border, the
                                commissioned officers thereof shall receive the same pay as officers
                                of the same grade in the United States army.
                            He thought this would commend itself to the judgment of every
                                man.
                            On motion by Mr. SMITH of Bartholomew, the amendment was laid on the
                                table.
                            Mr. CASON proposed to amend by adding a section authorizing the
                                organization of a corps of sappers and miners.
                            Mr. BUNDY regarded this as an amendment that will ride down the bill.
                                He had been counted amongst its enemies, but he was not.
                            Mr. CASON said he had uniformly voted in favor of the bill.
                            Mr. SHERMAN said such a provision had been asked for by every officer
                                in Camp Morton.
                            Mr. JENKINSON declared that the whole matter of the bill was a good
                                illustration of a corps of sappers and miners and their work. The
                                sappers and miners were the friends of the bill, and the fort was
                                the treasury up there. The trouble was that they would dig the hole
                                on the wrong side of the parapet. [Laughter.] They would begin their
                                work on the inside.
                            Mr. VEATCH considered there were too many regiments in the bill. He
                                considered three or four regiments might suffice. What had been done
                                - for arms. According to one of our bills we were to have but 20,000
                                arms. The number of regiments should be reduced or the number of
                                arms should be raised. Appeals were coming up to him every day for
                                arms. He proposed three or four regiments, and then invest two
                                millions for arms, and arm every man in the State capable of bearing
                                arms, and we would be far better off, practically, than with these
                                seven regiments, in every common sense view he could take of it.
                            Mr. Cason's amendment was rejected.
                            Mr. PARRETT proposed to reduce the number of regiments to three, and
                                to making but one Brigadier-General.
                            Mr. LANE concurred in Mr. Veatch's views.
                            Mr. CRANE proposed four regiments; which was rejected.
                            Mr. Parrett's amendment was then adopted.
                            Mr. GRESHAM proposed to add these words to the fourth section: "So
                                far as the same is not inconsistent with any law in force in this
                                State for the organization and regulation ot the Indiana
                                militia."
                            Which was adopted.
                            Mr. JENKINSON make an ineffectual motion to strike out "half pay,"
                                and insert "no pay" for the retired list in the close of the fifth
                                section.
                            The bill, as thus amended, was now passed the final reading in the
                                House - yeas 65, nays 15 - as follows:

                            Ordered, That the Clerk acquaint the Senate

                            Mr. KITCHEN asked to have the journal corrected, so that it shall not
                                show that he was "present and not voting," on the two million bill.
                                He was not present.
                            Ordered, That the journal be corrected

                            The House then adjourned.
                        
                        
                            Enrolled Act No. 4 of the House of

                        The Senate then unanimously refused to concur in all the amendments of
                            the House.
                        
                            TREASURY NOTES.
                            On motion by Mr. STUDABAKER, the committee report on Senator
                                Claypool's treasury note bill [17] was taken from the table.
                            Mr. MILLER moved to concur in the committee report so as to make
                                $1,000,000 in five dollar notes, $100,000 in tens and twenties, and
                                none of denomination of $100.
                            Mr. LINE made an ineffectual motion to lay this amendment on the
                                table.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER objected to the amendment. If these bills are taken,
                                it will be by persons who desire to get interest on them, and they
                                would not desire the notes in such small gums.
                            Mr. HAMILTON thought these notes would be husbanded for the purpose
                                of paying taxes, and the smaller denominations would be far more
                                acceptable to small tax-payers.
                            The amendment was adopted, and the committee report was concurred
                                in.
                            On motion by Mr. CLAYPOOL, two hundred copies of the bill and
                                amendments were ordered to be printed for the use of the Senate.
                        
                        
                             THE $2,000,000 LOAN.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER, from the Finance Committee,
                                returned the two million loan bill, H. R. 22, recommending passage
                                with amendments, one of which was to strike out $2,000,000 and inse
                                $1,500,000.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB moved to concur by striking out five cents on the hundred
                                dollars and inserting "four."
                            On motion by Mr. COBB, this motion was laid on the table.
                            Mr. CARNAHAN moved to lay the bill on the table and order 200 copies
                                printed.
                            Mr. BEESON made an ineffectual motion to lay this motion on the
                                table.
                            The motion to print was then rejected.
                            On motion by Mr. MILLER, this vote was reconsidered, and the order to
                                print agreed to.
                        
                        
                            REORGANIZATION OF THE MILITIA.
                            Mr. MELLETT,from the Committee on Military
                                Affairs, returned the military bill, [H. R. 21]
                                recommending passage, with amendments striking out of the llth
                                section the words: "such officers to be selected from the regiment,"
                                and by adding the following section:
                            SEC. 101. It is hereby made the duty of the Secretary of State to
                                have published with this act "the rules and articles of war and the
                                general regulations for the government of the army of the United
                                States," and have ten thousand copies of the same published in
                                pamphlet form and distributed pro rata to to the several
                                counties at the time and in the manner of distributing the laws, or
                                sooner if possible.
                            The report was concurred in, and so the amendments were adopted.
                            Mr. ANTHONY proposed to amend the second line of the tenth section by
                                striking out the word "battalion," and inserting in its place the
                                word "regiment."
                            This amendment was also agreed to.
                            Mr. ANTHONY proposed to further amend by inserting after the word
                                "clerk," in the twelfth line of section nine, these words: "Who
                                shall be elected by the company."
                            On motion by Mr. COBB, the further consideration of this subject was
                                postponed till Tuesday afternoon at two o'clock.
                        
                        
                            SUPPLIES FOR VOLUNTEERS.
                            On motion by Mr. HULL, it was
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That a committee of five be
                                            appointed, two on the part of the Senate and three on
                                            the part of the House, to examine the condition and
                                            quality of the provisions furnished the men in Camp
                                            Morton, and in the Commissary's department.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The PRESIDENT makes the committee on the part of the Senate to
                                consist of Messrs. Hull and Conley.
                        
                        
                            ADJOURNMENT TILL TUESDAY.
                            Mr. ODELL offered a resolution that when the Senate adjourn it be
                                till Tuesday, at two o'clock, P.M.
                            Mr. STEELE moved to amend by substituting Monday" for "Tuesday."
                            On motion by Mr. LANDERS, this amendment was laid on the table.
                            Mr. WOLFE made an ineffectual motion to lay the resolution on the
                                table.
                            After numerous propositions were made and rejected -
                            Mr. ODELL withdrew his resolution to enable the Senate to consider a
                                report from the Committee of Conference with the
                                House of Representatives.
                        
                        
                        
                            THE SIX REGIMENT BILL.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL, from the Committee on Free
                                    Conference on the disagreement between the two Houses
                                on Senator Wagner's six regiment bill [S. 1] made a written report
                                (which is embodied entire in the House proceedings).
                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            THE ADJOURNMENT - AGAIN.
                            Mr. ODELL again offered his resolution to adjourn over.
                            After discussion thereon -
                            The resolution was adopted.
                            And then the Senate adjourned till Tuesday, two o'clock, P. M.
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            SATURDAY, May 4, 1861.
                        
                        Mr. FORD, Mr. BLACK, Mr. KNOWLTON and Mr. PROSSER asked and obtained
                            leave to record their votes on the passage of the three regiment bill
                            yesterday. They voted no.
                        Mr. DOBBINS had leave to vote aye, on the passage of the same bill.
                        On the motion of Mr. FISHER, the reading of the journal of yesterday was
                            dispensed with.
                        
                            RETURN OF THE VOLUNTEERS.
                            Mr. HEFFREN submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Be it resolved (the Senate concurring
                                            therein), That the Governor be directed to return to
                                            their respective homes all such companies as have come
                                            to this city without orders, or in violation of the
                                            same; and that all companies that may hereafter come
                                            here without orders or in violation of the same be by
                                            him remanded in the same manner.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. H. said it had been supposed for a few days past that there would
                                be a call for more troops; but the Governor had informed him this
                                morning that there would be no call for troops for the present. Gen.
                                Wallace had told him that many companies had come here without
                                orders, and in violation of orders. The cost of keeping these men
                                here was 35 cents per day to the man. There was no use in our
                                feeding 5,000 men here at Indianapolis, when there was no use for
                                them whatever.
                            Mr. BUNDY suggested the propriety of adding the words, "at their own
                                expense."
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Oh, no.
                            Mr. GRESHAM. I undertake to say, that there are companies that have
                                come here under orders, and that there is no evidence of the fact in
                                the Adjutant General's office. Now, if you should return such
                                companies, it would be wrong and unfair. I would request the
                                gentleman from Washington and Harrison to hold up his resolution
                                till the six regiment or the three regiment bill, which ever you
                                call it, can be disposed of.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. One reason why I introduce this resolution, is the
                                obstinate determination evinced on the part of some captains to come
                                in here with men, and force themselves on the State, in violation of
                                the rights of others.
                            Mr. GRESHAM. Still, when they come in good faith, he disliked sending
                                them back; and he undertook to say, that there were companies here
                                accepted which ought not to have been here. He hoped the gentleman
                                would withdraw the resolution for the present.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. But why should these men have the preference who are
                                coming up here now in violation of orders?
                            Mr. NEBEKER was satisfied that something like this ought to be
                                done.
                            Mr. FRASIER. Had the Adjutant General kept any books at all?
                            Mr. NEBEKER. He did not know. The Adjutant had done his business in a
                                hurry. He knew one of the companies from Fountain county came
                                without orders, as appears on the books, but with orders received by
                                them.
                            Mr. ERWIN was opposed to the resolution. It would do injustice to
                                volunteers from his county. He named a case. He wanted what is
                                equal."
                            Mr. FRASIER. For that very reason, he was in favor of the resolution.
                                Men were coming up in the face of orders, to get advantage of those
                                who are drilling at their own expense at home. For the order of the
                                companies must be that in which service is tendered and accepted. It
                                had been well said, by the Adjutant General, that any captain coming
                                up here in violation of orders, was not fit to command a
                                company.
                            Mr. TURNER proposed to amend by adding these words:
                            Except such companies as have received orders from some officer
                                having competent authority to issue the same, the evidence of which
                                shall be the order itself.
                            Mr. DOBBINS supported the resolution.
                            Mr. BINGHAM. The term of enlistment being changed in the six regiment
                                bill, many would not be willing to go into the service, and he
                                thought, therefore, that the men here ought to be retained for the
                                present.
                            Mr. WOODHULL would retain all, or send all home. The resolution was
                                invidious.
                            Mr. MOORMAN demanded the previous question, and under its operation,
                                the amendment was rejected.
                            Mr. HEFFREN said the companies here now cost the State $26,000 a
                                week.
                            The resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            DEFICIENCIES.
                            Mr. FISHER submitted the following, which was adopted: That the
                                Auditor, Secretary and Treasurer of State, be requested to
                                communicate to this House what omissions were made in the
                                appropriation bills, and what items are deficient in amount.
                            Mr. HAYS submitted a formal order, that when this House adjourns, it
                                shall be till Monday, at 2 o'clock, P. M., which was laid on the
                                table.
                            The SPEAKER caused a communication to be read to the House, which was
                                an intimation from sundry ladies of Indianapolis, that an
                                opportunity was afforded for members to make their individual
                                contributions, towards their fund for arming the troops at camp with
                                copies of the New Testament.
                            Mr. WOODHULL submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Governor be directed
                                            to return to their respective homes, all the troops now
                                            here, and not mustered into service.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            SIX REGIMENT BILL.
                            On the motion of Mr. FISHER, this resolution was passed over
                                informally, and the Senate message just communicated by Mr. Brown,
                                their Sec-  retary, announcing
                                that body's refusal to concur in the amendments of the House to the
                                six regiment bill, was taken up. On his further motion it was -
                            Ordered, That the House insists on its amendments
                                and asks for a committee of conference
                                thereon.
                            Whereupon, the SPEAKER appointed Messrs. Fisher, Gresham, and
                                Heffren, to constitute said committee on the part of the House.
                            Mr. Woodhull spoke at length on his resolution, asking for definite
                                action thereon.
                            On motion of Mr. WILLIAMS, it was referred to the Committee
                                    on Military Affairs.
                            Mr. VEATCH submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the committee
                                                of conference be instructed to insist on
                                            no greater number than four regiments, and that they
                                            should be dismissed without pay when not needed.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The SPEAKER ruled it out. The House could not trouble a
                                    committee of free conference with
                                resolutions.
                        
                        
                            SUBSISTENCE OF TROOPS.
                            The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Commissary
                                General, Isaiah Mansur, in reply to the resolution of Mie 30th,
                                introduced by Mr. Henricks concerning the supply of military stores
                                and rations, the manner of the purchase, the cost, &c., which
                                was read by the Clerk.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Either the soldiers are great liars, or that report is
                                not reliable. On his motion, it was referred to the
                                    Committee on Military Affairs.
                            On motion by Mr. FISHER, the bill [S. 16] providing for the manner of procuring, and the
                                quality of subsistence and stores in the Commissary's and
                                Quartermaster's Department for the volunteer and military forces of
                                this State, and providing punishment for the violation thereof, was
                                taken and passed the first reading.
                            On his further motion, (the rules being suspended for the purpose,)
                                it was read the second time by title, and referred to the
                                    Committee on Ways and Means.
                        
                        
                            ORDER OF ACCEPTANCE OF VOLUNTEERS.
                            The SPEAKER now announced the consideration of the special order for
                                this hour (10 o'clock,) viz: the report of the special committee to
                                inquire into the order in which volunteer companies have been
                                reported to the Adjutant General, &c.
                            The report was read, being a list of the companies reported to the
                                Adjutant General's office, in excess of the six regiments mustered
                                into the service of the United States, with the names of their
                                Captains and counties.
                            After numerous suggestions of corrections,
                            Mr. VEATCH moved to recommit the report, with instructions to strike
                                from the list all companies that have not their rolls filed in the
                                Adjutant General's office, and rank the companies in the order of
                                their roll-files.
                            Mr. BUNDY and others cited cases for consideration.
                            Mr. FORD cited the case of a Captain who told him that he telegraphed
                                that his company was ready, and got it accepted before he had a man
                                in his company.
                            Mr. WILSON stated that the fourth company raised in Jefferson county,
                                when they were ready to march, received instructions to hold on and
                                keep themselves in readiness. The Captain done so. They had been
                                kept under drill on expense in the city of Madison; and he asked
                                whether they should not be remunerated.
                            Mr. WOODHULL knew a company which had been in camp several days. The
                                Captain had not yet filed his muster-roll. He had offered it to the
                                Adjutant General, and had been told it not necessary.
                            Mr. KNOWLTON hoped that the resolution would not be adopted, because,
                                since Captain Brown who had offered his company had received orders
                                to wait, others had been allowed to come in and file their
                                rolls.
                            Mr. CASON. This was the report of a committee appointed to
                                investigate the Adjutant General's office. I should like to know
                                what right this House has to 0 into the Adjutant's office to see
                                whether he has kept his books in order. If we are to instruct the
                                Adjutant General to send troops home, it seems to me it must be done
                                by concurrent resolution. I think all this outside the province of
                                the House. We can do no more than to receive this information and
                                act upon it.
                        
                        
                            SIX REGIMENT BILL.
                            On motion by Mr. FISHER, the report was passed over to enable him to
                                make the following report from the Committee of
                                    Conference, appointed this day:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Mr. Speaker, the Committee of Free
                                                Conference, to whom was referred the
                                            Senate bill No. 1 and, the disagreeing votes thereon
                                            between the two Houses, have agreed upon the following,
                                            and report the same to the House for its action with the
                                            following recommendations, viz.:

                            Mr. VEATCH hoped the House would not concur in this report. He was
                                not tenacious about his own views, but there is one provision in the
                                bill he regarded as wrong - the power to keep in service and dismiss
                                troops on half pay when not needed. That was open to glaring
                                injustice and wrong.  Mr.
                                FISHER. That matter was not before the committee.
                            Mr. VEATCH. But I desire to consider that matter.
                            The SPEAKER. The chair decides that the debate must now be confined
                                to the matter that was before the committee.
                            Mr. VEATCH was going to confine himself exclusively to the report. He
                                had never known before a ruling that would cut off the consideration
                                of anything properly connected with the question. The reason why he
                                was not in favor of concurring was, first, by this report they had
                                restored the six regiments; and secondly, that these six regiments
                                are to be quartered upon the State, and kept on half pay when there
                                is no use for them. He might consent to this if the committee had
                                agreed on but three or four regiments. But when they insist there
                                shall be six regiments, and that these six regiments shall be kept
                                on half pay when the State does not need their services, he insisted
                                that the House ought not to agree to the report so far as that is
                                concerned.
                            A VOICE. They won't neither.
                            Mr. VEATCH. There were various estimates, but none of the
                                distinguised men who have made them seem to have any distinct idea
                                as to how much these regiments are going to cost. But in the army of
                                the United States the estimate was that it costs about $1,000,000
                                annually to maintain one regiment of men. At such a time as this we
                                could scarcely touch anything by appropriation of money, that there
                                is not likely to be a large amount of wastage in it. Favoritisms
                                would creep in and men would hang round like vultures about a dead
                                body seeking to fatten on the State regardless of the rights and
                                interests of the people. For these six regiments he supposed there
                                were now anxiously regarding the proceedings of this body at least
                                six gentlemen who are, or who suppose themselves, qualified to be
                                colonels, six more who desire to be lieutenant colonels; and one at
                                least who expects to be made bragadier general. If the exigencies of
                                the country required that we should put into camp five thousand or
                                twenty thousand, or any number of men., he would be ready to go for
                                the measure; but when they are not needed he was not willing to
                                support any man on half pay to do nothing or even less than nothing;
                                though he repeated that he might assent even to that if the number
                                were reduced to three regiments - consent to have them quartered
                                upon us at half pay. But when it came to putting six regiments upon
                                us it was a public burden a little too heavy to be borne. He did not
                                want to stint their pay. If they have to fight, pay them: but if
                                there is no need for them he would leave it to the discretion of the
                                Governor to let them go out of the service on the same footing with
                                the other militia of the State.
                            Mr. JENKINSON said the gentleman from Spencer was right. This was a
                                bill for the benefit of officers. He would give millions for arms if
                                necessary. He would arm every man for defense. This bill was only
                                made for camp life. He said if this bill should pass it would kill
                                every man that would vote for it; and so it ought. Give men half pay
                                at home! It was wrong. The men here voting against the bill would
                                give as much for defense, as those voting for it.
                            Mr. FRASIER was averse to renewing this discussion. He differed with
                                the gentleman from Spencer, while there was perhaps no difference
                                between them in principle. He was for the half pay provision as a
                                matter of economy. There was also a provision in the bill, that,
                                when the troops were not needed, gave the Governor full power to
                                disband the troops and send them, home without any pay. But if
                                things should so shape themselves that they could be retired
                                temporarily only, there would come in the advantage of the half pay
                                provision. The threat that voting for this bill would kill a man
                                politically was wholly lost upon him.
                            Mr. RAGAN. This was a very important measure; and in the discussion
                                of any measure one man's opinion was just as sacred as another's,
                                and our motives should not be impugned. Every member here stood on
                                an equal footing, and if we differed on this subject it was no
                                wonder. We differ on all subjects and have a right to differ. Men
                                did not like to be brow-beaten; and he was sorry to see a
                                disposition to indulge in that way, with reference to our brave
                                volunteers around us, who could not speak here for themselves. He
                                rejoiced to see the patriotism evinced by our men who are crowding
                                into the army at such a time as this, and hoped nothing would be
                                said, at least in this place, to discourage and repress that
                                patriotism. He gloried in the readiness of our people to volunteer.
                                He hoped we might have ten thousand men more than we needed. * * * *
                                * He was willing to make the number of the regiments four, or even
                                five, but six he thought would be more than enough. He could not
                                believe that the General Government would desert the State of
                                Indiana. We had men enough now up in Camp Morton. The important
                                point was to guard our border, and our President would take care of
                                that. He was glad to see the proclamation by the Governor of
                                Kentucky for a special election of members of Congress, to be ready
                                for the called session in July. It showed that Kentucky was going to
                                stay in the Union; and he thanked God for that. He knew the Governor
                                of Kentucky, that he had been in the council of traitors; but he
                                hoped that he was now in the hands of better men. If he thought ten
                                regiments were necessary, he would vote them freely.
                            Mr. ROBERTS would like to know whether, while Gov. Magoffin was
                                making this proclamation, he was not secretly conniving at the work
                                of sending troops to the Southern confederates?
                            [Here a Senate message by Mr. Drapier, their Secretary, announced
                                that that body had concurred in this report without a
                                division.]
                            Mr. FISHER was very much surprised to hear the gentleman from Spencer
                                endeavor to create the impression that sinister and unworthy motives
                                were operating here in favor of six regiments.
                            Mr. VEATCH. If any language of that sort had escaped him he did not
                                intend it. He was referring, not to members upon this floor, but to
                                men at large, who think themselves qualified for military positions.
                                He hoped the gentleman would allow him to say that he had no idea
                                any member of the committee had any ambitious views in that
                                direction.
                            Mr. FISHER. The gentleman dwelt upon the cost of these regiments.
                                Last night, after con- 
                                sultation with Gen. Morris and with Major Wood, of the U. S. army, I
                                went to work and made up an estimate of the cost of these regiments.
                                I believe the number of non-commissioned officers and privates in
                                each regiment is 674. The estimate of the cost of pay and
                                subsistence of these men is one dollar each, which is $20,220 a
                                month for each regiment. There would be ten captains at $150 a
                                month, which is $1,500. Seventy lieutenants would be $2,500. One
                                colonel, $300 a month. One lieutenant colonel, $280. One major,
                                $270. Two sergeant-majors, $200 a month each. Five staff officers,
                                $625. Then one third of the pay of the brigadier-general, (he
                                commands three regiments) $150. The total of these being multiplied
                                by twelve, make $254,940, for the cost of pay and subsistence of one
                                regiment for twelve months. To cover all contingencies, add fifty
                                per cent., which is $382,410. Six regiments, then, on full pay for
                                one year,would cost $2,294,640. I have added fifty per cent, for
                                contingencies by the advice of Major Wood, who has been in the army
                                fifty years, and Gen. Morris concurs with him. These estimates are
                                justified by the pay-roll of the army of the United States. One word
                                more: I am not going to argue the expediency of six regiments or any
                                other number; but the Committee on the part of the Senate assured us
                                in our conference that the Senate were determined to adhere to their
                                opposition to the amendment of the House reducing that number. We
                                were, therefore, obliged to report that the House recedes from that.
                                We thought it better, therefore, to make this report, even if the
                                House should adhere and call for a second committee on that point.
                                We thought this course batter than to risk the chance of getting no
                                bill at all.
                            Mr. EDSON inquired whether the proviso as to giving preference to
                                companies in the counties, that have had no companies accepted, was
                                stricken out?
                            Mr. FISHER. Yes.
                            Mr. NEBEKER demanded the previous question, and under its operation,
                                the House refused to concur in the report of the Committee - affirm
                                positive 26, negative 44.
                            Mr. VEATCH. I move now that the House ask for a new
                                    Committee of Conference.
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair would state to the House that it is of the
                                utmost importance that this bill should be disposed of today. It was
                                due to the feeling of the men in camp. Our men ought to know what
                                they have to depend upon, and the House should forthwith appoint or
                                refuse to appoint another Committee of
                                Conference.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. That is what I am willing to do. The House has refused
                                to concur in the report, and there should be an end of it.
                            Mr. VEATCH considered the motion was double. The first question
                                being, Will the House concur? and that being decided in the
                                negative, the second is, Will the House ask for another
                                Committee?
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair is of the opinion that the motion is not
                                double. The remark of the Chair was dictated by a desire to let the
                                House know the wish of the officers and men, and the condition of
                                things at the camp.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. What did the Chair say with regard to mutiny?
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair should state that the camp is not in what
                                might be called a state of mutiny. The men are greatly desirous of
                                being retained in the service; but there is a painful state of
                                uncertainty of mind as to whether they are to go home or not.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. The House has passed a resolution that the Governor send
                                home all the companies that have not been accepted.
                            A VOICE. The Senate has not concurred in that.
                            Mr. GRAIN. The Senate certainly ought to concur in that
                                resolution.
                            SEVERAL VOICES. The Senate has adjourned till Tuesday.
                            Mr. CRAIN. Still I think we ought to appoint another committee. I
                                want the country to see what that body has done.
                            Mr. PACKARD. I understand that the Senate has not yet adjourned -
                                only agreed that when it does adjourn it shall be till Tuesday.
                            A VOICE. They have adjourned.
                            Mr. GRAIN. I don't want to talk. I am in favor of the committee.
                            Mr. DOBBINS moved to take up the Senate message announcing their
                                concurrence in the report of the Committee of Free
                                    Conference, and agree to that.
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair would inform the Senator from Martin that we
                                have nothing whatever to do with the Senate's action on the report
                                of the Committee of Conference.
                            Mr. PROSSER. I can not consent that either the Senate of the State of
                                Indiana or the boys out in camp - good fellows as they are - shall
                                force us into any measure of legislation. I say, let us act like men
                                of honor. If they want to adjourn and go to the devil, let them do
                                so; I am for asserting the dignity and rights of this House. I will
                                never yield to revolution.
                            Mr. CASON. I was informed that the Senate adjourned because they
                                could get no quorum.
                            Mr. PROSSER. Then somebody is to blame. I hope we shall not break up,
                                but insist upon a new committee.
                            Mr. HEFFREN demanded the previous question, and under its force, the
                                motion for a new committee of conference was
                                adopted. Whereupon the Chair, on the part of the House, appointed
                                Messrs. Veatch, Parrett and Robbins.
                        
                        
                            TREASON AND ITS PUNISHMENT.
                            On motion of Mr. HEFFREN, the House now took up the consideration of
                                the Senate amendments to the House amendment of the treason bill, S.
                                5, and the same was concurred in without a division.
                        
                        
                            THE SIX REGIMENT BILL.
                            Mr. PROSSER. I understand from a member of the Senate that they did
                                the best they could to obtain a quorum.
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair would remark that the excuse for absence on
                                the part of the President of the Senate was the intelligence just
                                received by him that his house was fired by an incendiury last
                                night.
                            Mr. FRASIER moved that when the House adjourn it shall be till
                                Tuesday, two o'clock.  Mr.
                                SMITH, of Bartholomew, said he had been informed by one of the
                                captains of volunteers that he would go to the camp and bring his
                                men down and mob us.
                            The SPEAKER. That matter is not before the House. The question is on
                                the motion of the gentleman from Kosciusko [Mr. Frasier.]
                            Mr. HEFFREN, (in his seat.) I believe I'll join 'em; for the House
                                has not been anything but a mob for two days.
                            Mr. FRASIER withdrew his adjournment motion for -
                            Mr. WOODHULL. I move to reconsider the vote by which the House
                                refused to concur in the report of the committee of
                                    conference on the disagreeing votes about the six
                                regiment bill.
                            Mr. JEKKINSON. Does the Chair entertain that motion.
                            The SPEAKER. The motion to reconsider is before the Honse.
                            Mr. JENKINSON. Then I appeal from the decision of the Chair.
                            The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Allen will reduce his appeal to
                                writing.
                            Mr. JENKINSON thereupon submitted the following:
                            "A motion to concur in the report of the committee of
                                    conference having been voted down by the House, and a
                                motion to appoint a further committee of
                                    conference having been sustained by the House, and
                                that further committee having been appointed, it is not in order to
                                move a reconsideration of the original motion."
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair will state that a motion to reconsider is
                                always in order, unless a similar motion has been already rejected.
                                The question is, shall the decision of the Chair stand as the
                                judgment of the House?
                            Mr. WOODHULL said he came here with the Intention of doing what is
                                necessary for the defense of the honor and protection of the
                                interests and rights of the State of Indiana and the General
                                Government; and during the protracted discussion on this and the
                                military bill he had not uttered one word. He had remained here in
                                silence because he knew very little of military matters. He was
                                unwilling now to do anything that is not required by the necessity
                                of the case; but hearing that the border is invaded; that the houses
                                of the members of the Legislature are burned down, he was obliged to
                                regard hesitation here upon any measure for the public defense, as
                                putting dollars and cents in the scale as against the property and
                                lives of our fellow citizens. He considered that in refusing to
                                concur in the report of the committee of
                                    conference we have done wrong. He was not for
                                responding needlessly with expensive preparations, but still willing
                                to take the last dollar if necessary. He was decidedly in favor of
                                concurrence. And if a few days in the future should show that there
                                is no necessity for this preparation, if we remain in session a few
                                days until that time, we can repeal the bill. The city of Louisville
                                had voted $200,000 to arm that city alone. How then could it be said
                                that we've done too much in voting $500,000 to arm the State of
                                Indiana? Whilst other States were concentrating on our Southern
                                border, it seemed almost as though we were idle. It has been said
                                that we can arm our men down there. But their men had come up here
                                into camp, and men could not be here or at home and at the point of
                                defense at the same time. He would say, send troops down to the aid
                                of the Southern border, and put arms into the hands of our fellow
                                citizens there. Both these measures of precaution would perhaps be
                                needed, and no man could tell how soon.
                            Here the House took a recess till 2 o'clock, P.M.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Secretary
                                of State with reference to the distribution of the current volumes
                                of Indiana Reports, and a money difficulty about getting them from
                                the publishers.
                            On motion by Mr. FRASIER, it was referred to a select Committee of
                                five.

                            
                                SIX REGIMENT BILL.
                                The House then resumed the consideration of Mr. Woodhull'g motion
                                    to re-consider the vote non-concurring in the report of the
                                        Committee of Conference about the
                                    disagreeing votes on the House amendments to the six regiment
                                    bill.
                                Mr. DOBBINS took his position in favor of this bill without
                                    reference to outside influences. If there was a necessity for
                                    one regiment, there was a necessity for six. Gentlemen have
                                    neglected to notice the position of defence in which the States
                                    of Illinois and Ohio had placed themselves. We had been looking
                                    southward for conciliation. We were looking at the cost of these
                                    preparations for defence. But it would not do to balance money
                                    against the integrity of the Government, and the security of the
                                    rights, and of the lives and the property of our people. He
                                    hoped the House would order the re-consideration ; that these
                                    regiments would be authorized, and also that arms would be
                                    placed in the hands of the people. Would the man be politically
                                    buried who should vote against this bill? Well: he was willing
                                    to be buried if he could but maintain the honor of his country,
                                    and provide effectually for the security of the interests and
                                    the perpetuity of the institutions, and the welfare of our
                                    beloved country, and of the State of Indiana. [Applause.]
                                Mr. GRESHAM also desired the re consideration. It had been said
                                    by the gentleman from Spencer, that there were men hungry as
                                    vultures, hanging round here for promotion in these regiments.
                                    If this were true, could not the same objection be urged against
                                    any similar bill? He showed that the Senate had yielded
                                    something in this Conference report. The cavalry had been
                                    conceded. Cairo was sure to be attacked, and that would be the
                                    signal for war all along the river line. These very men in these
                                    six regiments would probably be required on that line. With
                                    them, we could have a force anywhere on the borders at a day's
                                    notice. The reason for the retired half-pay was in the fact that
                                    these men had left their business, and could not leave it and
                                    take it up at pleasure, without loss.
                                Mr. BRETT, interrupting, asked what had become of the rumor that
                                    there was a requisition for more troops?
                                The SPEAKER. The Chair had a conversation with the Governor since
                                    dinner, and the Gov-  ernor
                                    said he had received several telegraphic dispatches from
                                    Washington, from which he gathered that six regiments more would
                                    be required of this State. But the Secretary of War had not yet
                                    made his apportionment for the call. The Governor supposed that
                                    he would be fully advised by Monday.
                                Mr. GRESHAM resumed. He would take the best bill he could get. He
                                    had been ready to acquiesce in three regiments. Indiana was much
                                    more exposed than Michigan, and Michigan had authorized eight
                                    regiments.
                                Mr. HEFFREN supported the government without reserve in every
                                    emergency. The Governor had not responded to the inquiry of the
                                    House as to how many men were needed; and today the Governor had
                                    told him that the Legislature ought to take this responsibility.
                                    He had advocated this bill yesterday. But when it was proposed
                                    to give us but three regiments, it was but to invite incursions
                                    from the enemy. Now, there were perhaps strong and ready hands
                                    enough on the Southern border. Then, since the House had refused
                                    to concur in the conference report, he would say to gentlemen,
                                    give us arms and keep your men at home! He was even sorry the
                                    motion had been made to reconsider. He did not expect gentlemen
                                    to be dragooned into a change of the votes they had given this
                                    morning. The men of the border were able and willing to take
                                    care of themselves.
                                Mr. NEBEKER was ready, as he had been this morning, to close up
                                    this business by voting for the six regiments.
                                Mr. HEFFREN had thought he would not himself go for this
                                    reconsideration. He certainly would not go on his knees here to
                                    ask justice for protection of the border. But the border was
                                    menaced, and if the State would give them arms they would hold
                                    their position, and stand as a breakwater to keep off the
                                    invaders from their Northern brothers. But still the question
                                    would come home: Will you do us justice, or will you not?
                                Mr. ATKINSON. Did not the gentleman vote against the bill
                                    yesterday?
                                Mr. HEFFREN. He voted against it because of its three-quarters
                                    pay of officers. What man that loved his State would be willing
                                    to subject the brave man that volunteers for her defense to be
                                    taunted as "three-quarter officers."
                                Mr. VEATCH could not endorse the intimation of the gentleman from
                                    Washington and Harrison that the North was not willing to do us
                                    justice. He repeated his paramount desire to have a well armed
                                    militia. He thought the Legislature should not adjourn without
                                    appropriating a half a million of dollars more to arm the
                                    militia.
                                Mr. GRESHAM. If you will introduce a bill making such an
                                    appropriation I will vote for it.
                                SEVERAL VOICES. "So will I."
                                Mr. JENKINSON. I have a bill appropriating a million of dollars
                                    for arms. I tried to get the floor to introduce it.
                                Mr. VEATCH. A well armed militia was the best defense against
                                    invasion. He referred; for an example, to the fields of
                                    Lexington and Concord, and other scenes of the war of the
                                    revolution. As a matter of choice, of judgment, of judicious
                                    expenditure, he preferred not to concentrate so much money in
                                    these regiments. He preferred to expend less for men, and more
                                    to buy arms. [Applause.] He gave notice that if some other
                                    member did not he should, now, at an early hour, introduce a
                                    bill making the approprition to purchase arms for the purpose he
                                    had indicated.
                            
                            
                                PERSONAL EXPLANATION.
                                Mr. SMITH of Bartholomew (by unanimous consent) read the
                                    following paper:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            INDIANAPOLIS, May 4,1861.
                                            MR. SMITH, Representative from Bartholomew - We find
                                                in the papers of this morning, that in reply to a
                                                question of Mr. Allen, that you made use of the
                                                following language, to-wit: That the people of
                                                Kentucky were just such Union men as I am; they
                                                would not invade the soil of any other State with
                                                any hostile purpose. Now, sir, the people regard
                                                such sentiments as traitorous, and perhaps it would
                                                be well for you to remember that in times like
                                                these, the people sometimes declare themselves above all law. We
                                                are satisfied that you are doing all you can to
                                                defeat the passage of all bills for the support of
                                                our army, raised for the maintenance of our Union.
                                                And, further, that the people of this State require,
                                                and will insist, that the body of which you are a
                                                member, make all necessary appropriations for the
                                                defense of the State and of the Union, and that if
                                                the Legislature should adjourn without making
                                                provisions for the support of our noble volunteers,
                                                that those who are found to have caused the failure
                                                of such support, will never be permitted to leave
                                                Central Indiana.
                                            
                                                VIGILANCE
                                                  COMMITTEE.
                                            
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. SMITH called for the reading of the following report, of his
                                    language yesterday, pending the consideration of Mr. Jenkinson's
                                    resolution, to which the paper refers:
                                Mr. SMITH, of Bartholomew, could not forbear saying a word for
                                    the Union men of Kentucky. Had not the Union men, once before
                                    this, overcome the secession efforts of Governor Magoffin? and
                                    might they not do so again? He believed it would appear now soon
                                    that a majority of the people of Kentucky are Union men. Their
                                    Legislature were to convene soon. The secession candidates for
                                    their convention had withdrawn from the contest.
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN. Were they conditional or unconditional Union
                                    men?
                                Mr. SMITH. They were just such Union men as he (Mr. Smith). They
                                    would not invade the soil of any other State with a hostile
                                    purpose.
                                Mr. SMITH. Gentlemen may be disposed to make light of this
                                    matter, but I don't know how it is. However, I would ask
                                    gentlemen to bear me witness that I have not pursued a
                                    treasonable course upon this floor. On the contrary, I have
                                    labored earnestly for the passage of the military bill and all
                                    the other bills of the session to provide for the public
                                    defense; and I call upon the House to say whether these
                                    sentiments or any any other sentiments of mine can be
                                    justly characterized as traitorous or treasonable. If the House
                                    will say so, I will resign my place and go home; but I will not
                                    be intimidated by such threats as that paper contains. I have
                                    endeavored at this session and every other that I have served
                                    here to do what I conceived to be my duty in the service of my
                                    constituents and the State at large. I have uniformly voted
                                    without reference to sinister views, and I shall not now take
                                    any course inconsistant with my record. But I must be allowed to
                                    act in all matters as my judgment shall dictate; and I will do
                                    that though my body be taken from this hall as a corpse.
                                Mr. GRAIN had voted against concurrence because six regiments
                                    were too many. He had hoped to reduce the number by one
                                    regiment. But since another conference could not be had;  since he had always been a
                                    friend of the bill; and in order to retain the men now here, he
                                    came to the conclusion that we should all vote for it. He was
                                    not like his friend from Washington. He did care whether the
                                    State was defended or not. He also desired to see arms placed in
                                    the hands of the people, and would be willing to vote more money
                                    for that. He believed that the harmonious organization of the
                                    Legislature had had a healthy effect on the mind of
                                    the State at large, and he considered that, for the same reason,
                                    all such bills as this should be passed here as a unit, just as
                                    he understood his had passed the Senate.
                                Mr. UNDERWOOD desired the previous question, but did not press
                                    the demand.
                                Mr. JENKINSON demanded the yeas and nays, and they were
                                    ordered.
                                Mr. EDSON said: From the very outset I have voted for men and
                                    money, upon every question, and with regard to this six regiment
                                    bill I was one of the committee that reported it with the
                                    amendments. I have voted in favor of every proposition to
                                    a'dvance that bill. I voted in favor of it when it had only
                                    three regiments in it. I have voted for it all the time. I was
                                    anxious for the bill as it went last night to the Senate. And
                                    now, since they have thrown out our amendments, and the House
                                    has refused to agree to the adjustment in the report of the
                                        committee of conference, I am still
                                    anxious for it. One of the provisions I have most earnestly
                                    desired was that those counties which have not been able to get
                                    their companies accepted here should have the preference in
                                    these regiments, but that was stricken out. On the last vote
                                    that was taken here, as to whether we should concur in the
                                    report of the committee - not knowing that the Senate had
                                    adjourned - not knowing but we should have another conference
                                    upon the conflicting votes, I voted against concurrence in the
                                    report of the joint committee. I did not do this because I was
                                    not in favor of doing every thing I could do for the honor of
                                    our State and country, and the defense of our people in every
                                    emergency. I live in a portion of the State that is most exposed
                                    to incursions. I live, sir, where at every hour defenceless
                                    houses are being attacked in the night, and pillaged and
                                    plundered by marauding parties of secessionists. I live in the
                                    first town on the Ohio river that is likely to be the place of
                                    attack and conflict above Cairo; and I wish to make my appeal to
                                    the House to reconsider this vote and act with me in every
                                    effort to uphold the honor of our country and its flag, by
                                    supplying all the men and means in our powercost what it may and
                                    throw in our own personal services, regardless of everything but
                                    duty and honor.
                                The question was then taken upon the motion to reconsider,
                                    resulting - yeas 58, nays 22.
                                So the vote was reconsidered and the question recurred again,
                                    Shall the House concur in the report of the Conference
                                        Committee.
                                Mr. UNDERWOOD and Mr. CHAPMAN demanded the previous question and
                                    there was a second.
                                The yeas and nays having been demanded by Mr. Jenkinson and Mr.
                                    Smith, of Bartholomew, were again ordered, and, being taken,
                                    resulted - yeas 60, nays 17 - as follows:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            YEAS - Messrs. Anderson, Atkinson, Bingham,

                                Mr. ATKINSON, pro forma. I am satisfied three
                                    regiments would be sufficient; but inasmuch as the Senate has
                                    adjourned, I will vote to concur in the report rather than lose
                                    the bill.
                                Mr. JENKINSON desired to be excused from voting to enable him to
                                    say that his opposition to the bill had not been factious, but
                                    the rules were enforced against him and he withdrew his
                                    application.
                                So the report was concurred in. [The announcement was received
                                    with demonstrations of applause in the House and in the
                                    galleries.]
                                Mr. FRASIER desired to repeat what he said in reply tn the
                                    gentleman from Alien. He had said that the man who voted in
                                    these times with a view simply to political preferment would be
                                    buried so deep that the hand of political resurrection would
                                    never reach him.
                                Mr. VEATCH. Mr. Speaker, whilst this patriotic fervor is upon the
                                    House, I hope the gentleman from Allen will be allowed to
                                    introduce his bill to appropriate money to buy arms.
                                ["Consent" "consent."]
                            
                            
                                ARMS FOR CITIZEN SOLDIERY.
                                Mr. JENKINSON then had leave to introduce a bill [31] entitled an
                                    act to procure additional arms for the citizen soldiery of the
                                    State of Indiana. [It appropriates one million of dollars to
                                    procure arms for the voluntary active militia of the State of
                                    Indiana, to be expended in due proportion for the cavalry,
                                    artillery and infantry service.]
                                The bill was passed to the second reading.
                            
                            
                                ADJOURNMENT TILL TUESDAY.
                                Mr. HEFFREN. I understand that it is necessary when we make an
                                    order to adjourn over till Tuesday to do so by resolution. I

                                            Resolved, That when this House
                                                adjourns it shall be till Tuesday, two o'clock, P.

                                The resolution was adopted.
                            
                            
                                ARMS FOR CITIZEN SOLDIERY.
                                On motion by Mr. JENKINSON, the rules being suspended for the
                                    purpose, his bill [31] was read again and considered on the
                                    second reading,
                                Mr. GRESHAM proposed to amend by striking out "one million" and
                                    inserting "$500,000 "
                                The bill and the proposed amendment were referred to the
                                        Committee on Ways and Means.

                                AN ACT to provide for the employment of six regiments of
                                    volunteers for the protection of the property and citizens of

                            TUESDAY, May 7, 1861.
                        
                        The Senate was not in session this forenoon.
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            Mr. G. B. GRUBB, the Senator from Hamilton and Tipton, appeared in
                                his seat to-day, having been detained at home since the commencement
                                of this extra session, by sickness in his family.

                            
                                ROOMS FOR THE SUPREME COURT.
                                On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB the concurrent resolution, offered by
                                    Senator Slack, on Wednesday morning, providing rooms for Judges
                                    of the Supreme Court, was taken from the table and adopted.
                            
                            
                                REORGANIZATION OF THE MILITIA.
                                The PRESIDENT announced the consideration of the special order
                                    for this hour, the militia bill [H. R. 21.] The question being
                                    on Mr. Anthony's amendment, offered Saturday morning,
                                The amendment was agreed to.
                                On motion by Mr. WOLFE, the bill was further amended in section
                                    101 by making it the duty of the Secretary of State to have
                                    published only so much of the rules and articles of war, and the
                                    general regulation for the government of the army of the United
                                    States, as may be directed by the Governor.
                                Mr. RAY. I move to amend by striking out in section 33, these
                                    words, "with such modifications as the Governor may prescribe."
                                    I think it right that the militia should know what the articles
                                    of war are, and precisely what they are acting under, and their
                                    responsibilities, without leaving it to the regulations of the
                                    Executive of the State. I think it highly proper that
                                        that portion should be stricken out, inasmuch as
                                    it might produce trouble, and great lack of harmony and
                                    uniformity in the service.
                                Mr. MURRAY. This bill provides for the organization of citizens
                                    into military companies, and if these rules apply to them when
                                    called upon for active service, they ought not to apply to them
                                    when not in actual service.
                                Mr. RAY. They do not. I think the section is right with the
                                    modification I propose. It seems to me it must strike every
                                    Senator, at a glance, that the rules and articles of war should
                                    not be altered or subjected to modification.
                                Mr. WOLFE. As I understand the proposition, it is to strike out
                                    all that portion of the section which refers to the modification
                                    of the rules of war by the Governor.
                                Mr. RAY. The amendment proposes to strike out these words: "with
                                    such modifications as the Governor may prescribe."
                                Mr. WOLFE. I presume that the intention of the person who drew
                                    that bill in putting in these  words was to lessen the vigorous character of these rules,
                                    that is, to give the Governor power to lessen their vigorous
                                    character. If that be true, in point of fact, I am opposed to
                                    striking out. Any gentleman that has read these rules knows they
                                    are very vigorous. I can not scarcely consent to vote for the
                                    bill unless one of the articles of war were stricken out
                                    entirely. It is in regard to the behavior of persons while
                                    attending religious services. I think it is unconstitutional in
                                    the State of Indiana to enforce that article.
                                The amendment was rejected.
                                [A message from the Governor by Mr. Holloway, his Secretary,
                                    announced that he had approved and signed Senator Stone's bill,
                                    No. 12.]
                                Mr. DICKINSON proposed to amend the 7th section by striking out
                                    the word "seventy" and Inserting in lieu thereof the word
                                    "forty," so that the amount of appropriation for a special
                                    military fund shall be $40,000 instead of $70,000.
                                Mr. COBB proposed to amend the amendment by striking out
                                    "$40,000" and inserting $25,000.
                                Mr. MILLER made an ineffectual motion to lay these amendments on
                                    the table.
                                The amendment to the amendment was rejected.
                                Mr. COBB then moved to amend the amendment by striking out
                                    $40,000 and inserting in lieu thereof $10,000; and on that
                                    motion he demanded the yeas and nays.
                                Mr. NEWCOMB. We have seen the necessity of something of this kind
                                    in the emergency in which we have found ourselves recently. I
                                    would not vote for any bill shorn of its deficiencies as this
                                    one would be were the proposed amendment adopted. We have been
                                    without a militia for many years, and we see the lack of a
                                    proper organized militia when the call is made for troops. We
                                    find Massachusetts responding in four days with more regiment?
                                    than were called for, all equipped and ready for service. * * *
                                    The Colonel of the regiment that went through Baltimore received
                                    his orders at 11 o'clock at night, in the midst of a storm; he
                                    started off that night and saw his Captains, and so efficient
                                    was their system that at one o'clock the next day that entire
                                    regiment was ready to march. Two companies of another regiment
                                    were called for; the Captains received their orders at two
                                    o'clock on Tuesday morning, and at eleven o'clock the two
                                    companies were in Fanuel Hall. Could Indiana or Illinois have
                                    done that? Not at all. Why was this? For years Massachusetts has
                                    been preparing. She has got a military system, everybody there
                                    was equipped, ready at the first summons. * * * I deprecate
                                    unnecessary expense. I think whatever will give us an efficient
                                    military system is economy. I have no doubt we have spent more
                                    money for want of a system than this bill would take from our
                                    pockets in three years. It is said the operations of this bill
                                    will cost $70,000 annually, and I have no doubt the patriotic
                                    militia will respond out ot their own pockets in a further sum
                                    of $70,000. I hope we will not be niggardly in the starting of a
                                    system which Indiana has never had. * * * We can fit out an
                                    entire regiment, without half trying, in this city, and two more
                                    in the county. Such will be tho spirit all over the State. I
                                    hope this appropriation will not be decreased. I had rather vote
                                    to increase it to $100,000 than decrease it $10,000.
                                Mr. DICKINSON. I find myself in the dark with regard to most all
                                    the questions coming before this Legislature. All have remarked
                                    their utter ignorance of them; and I have to make the same
                                    acknowledgment. But I concur with the Senator from Marion [Mr.
                                    Newcomb] in that I hope this Legislature will not act niggardly
                                    in making the preparations to perfect a military system. I for
                                    one am far from that. Rather than have this sum diminished, I
                                    would increase it, if necessary, in order to make the system
                                    efficient. It did seem to me as though this sum was too large to
                                    commence an experiment on; for this is an experiment, and one
                                    that Indiana has never known anything about. With this sum we
                                    can not insure efficiency. It strikes me if we appropriate this
                                    sum, before three years it will have to be trebled, and then we
                                    will not have a system that will be efficient. We have been in
                                    the habit of performing military duty under a corn-stalk system,
                                    without appropriations, and if this appropriation is made, a few
                                    will have control of it. The question which presents itself to
                                    my mind was, whether the sum of $60,000 would not be as
                                    efficient as the sum of $70,000 or $140,000 to start with. I am
                                    assured this sum will be increased at a future day, provided a
                                    military system is necessary. If it is not necessary, then of
                                    course it will not be done; but it will be necessarily
                                    increased, I apprehend, and if we commence at a high figure we
                                    will have to go at a rapid rate. I do not object to voting just
                                    as much means as is necessary, but it does seem to me, in
                                    starting out the sum I propose would be as efficient as a larger
                                    sum. I do hope the amendment offered by the gentleman from
                                    Lawrence [Mr. Cobb] will not be entertained by any member. I
                                    hope no captious opposition will be made. When I made my motion
                                    it was not done to oppose the system or to prevent its becoming
                                    an efficient system; but because I believed the sum I proposed
                                    was all that is necessary to commence with.
                                Mr. COBB. I did not intend to cripple the system as laid down in
                                    this bill. My opinion is that $10,000 is sufficient. Now I do
                                    not understand that any of the money provided for in this bill
                                    is to go into the hands of the privates for the purpose of
                                    paying them for drilling and uniforming, but to pay a few
                                    officials who are constituted under this bill to organize the
                                    militia of the State into service. Now, sir, I understand that
                                    $70,000, which is provided for in this bill, is too much. I am
                                    confident that $70,000 would pay the judges and prosecuting
                                    attorneys of this State, so far as the circuit court is
                                    concerned. I understand that bands of music, drums and fifes are
                                    to be purchased for the purpose of giving music to the ear if
                                    the private when called forth from his quiet home and caused to
                                    loose his time in the service of the militia, while officers are
                                    to be compensated with this money. I do not see the necessity of
                                    this large appropriation for that purpose, believe that in all
                                    times like these we have patriots enough in every locality who
                                    will volunteer their services, and will muster the militia into
                                    service, if they have a law to be governed by; and  my opinion is we are running wild
                                    over this question of war. As far as the privates are concerned,
                                    all the duty is imposed upon them, and they have, when they
                                    volunteer their services under this bill, to uniform themselves,
                                    for I do not understand that any of this money is to uniform
                                    companies. Now, if this $70,000 is for the purpose of paying a
                                    few officers who may happen to control the men, I think it is
                                    too much; I think $10,000 is sufficient. Another thing, I do not
                                    believe this bill will ever benefit the State, as far as placing
                                    her upon a war footing is concerned. The only reason I would
                                    vote for any such a bill is to organize men and put them under
                                    the control of officers for the purpose of imbuing in them a
                                    spirit of patriotism; for I undertake to say there will not be a
                                    single individual that will come out of these organized
                                    companies after three years' training, (as provided for by this
                                    bill,) with any practical knowledge. As far as spending money
                                    under that bill is concerned it is all nonsense. You had better
                                    appropriate half a million of dollars and put men upon drill,
                                    paying them for their services a reasonable compensation.
                                Mr. CARNAHAN. I do not know the object designed to be
                                    accomplished by this appropriation of money, and I have been
                                    waiting to hear some gentleman explain. I am willing, if I
                                    become satisfied it is necessary, to vote any sum, I don't care
                                    what it is; but to vote for $10,000, or any other amount,
                                    without knowing the intention or object, I will not do it. I
                                    shall vote against any proposition of the kind, unless I fully
                                    understand it. I hope gentlemen will explain, and when they do,
                                    and satisfy me that it is necessary, I certainly shall vote for
                                    it.
                                Mr. WOLFE. I agree with the Senator from Lawrence [Mr. Cobb] in
                                    regard to one thing. I think $70,000 is too much money to be
                                    appropriated in this bill. I think it more than is necessary.
                                    And I shall answer the inquiry of the Senator from Posey [Mr.
                                    Carnahan] before I take my seat. But with regard to the other
                                    points first. I am of the opinion that in order to make a system
                                    in this State as effective as the one in Massachusetts it would
                                    cost a great deal more money than $70.000. I do not think we
                                    ought to attempt to follow in the footsteps of Massachusetts in
                                    this any more than in other matters. The system which we
                                    establish, to be useful, should be one that would be permanent.
                                    If it is to last but for a single year and then be kicked over
                                    by the people in consequence of its expensiveness, it would do
                                    no good at all. It is not money that is going to maintain this
                                    system. If there be an occasion which will justify a military
                                    organization throughout the country, such an occasion as shall
                                    inspire a military spirit such as is abroad now, the people will
                                    go into it whether paid for it or not. In regard to that the
                                    observations of the Senator from Lawrence are just. I can assure
                                    Senators there is not one dollar of this money to find its way
                                    into the pockets of the privates of the companies, yet they are
                                    the men to do the great labor. I think the bill requires not
                                    less than sixteen days' service every year, for which they are
                                    to receive no pay. Under the bill this $70,000 will go for a
                                    particular purpose, and that purpose is designated. Sections 5
                                    and 6, I will inform the Senator from Posey, provides the -
                                    purposes for which the money is to raised - I will read
                                    them:
                                SEC. 5. One-fourth part of the military fund shall remain in the
                                    State Treasury, and shall be drawn on warrant of the
                                    Commander-in-Chief, to pay the salary the Adjutant-General, and
                                    the Quartermaster-General, and to pay the expenses of State and
                                    Brigade Encampment and Brigade Courts Martial, and such other
                                    expense's may accrue in the procurement of blanks provided for
                                    in this act.
                                SEC. 6. The balance of the military fund shall fort with be
                                    distributed, pro rata, by the Treasurer of
                                    State among those counties having an active militia, in
                                    proportion to the number of activemilitia in each county, as
                                    shown by the Adjutant-General, which money shall be paid to the
                                    Treasurer of said Counties, and by them distributed as follows:
                                        First. One-fourth of the fund thus placed
                                    into the hands of the County Treasurer shall be drawn on the
                                    warrant of the Colonel, to pay the actual expenses of the
                                    Quartermaster-General of the regiment, for the preservation of
                                    the public arms, and to defray the expenses of regimental or
                                    battalion drills, parades, encampments, and courts martial. Second. The balance of the fund, after the
                                    preceding disbursements shall be distributed on the warrant of
                                    the Colonel, amongst the companies of active militia in his
                                    regiment, proportioned in accordance with the number of members
                                    in each to be used by such companies to defray the expenses of
                                    company drills and courts martial, of armories and music and for
                                    the procurement of equipments and munitions.
                                These are the only ways in which this fund is to be distributed.
                                    How much money will absolutely be required to do all this work
                                    will depend on how many companies and regiments will organized
                                    in the State. It is an impossibility for us to make an
                                    appropriation that will exactly meet what the expenditures may
                                    be, because they are uncertain. There may be six companies
                                    organized in each county; there may be three, ten, or they may
                                    not average more than one; we can't tell. Suppose that $70,000
                                    will be enough to pay the ordinary expenses contemplated under
                                    sections five and six, in the event there are thee companies
                                    organized in each county, then if they organize ten companies in
                                    each county $70,000 would not be quite one-third enough. This
                                    brings me to remark that we must not expect the military system
                                    to be kept up in consequence of the money in it. If there is not
                                    patriotism enough to keep up this organization, money will not
                                    do it I have been willing at all times to vote for all proper
                                    amounts for the actual defense of the State or Federal
                                    Government or the people; indeed, I have done so with
                                    liberality, for I can not weight the defense of our people or
                                    the preservation of the best government on earth against dollars
                                    and cents. I am willing to vote for such appropriations without
                                    waiting for instruction from the people, and where I was
                                    satisfied they were necessary for such defense I would vote for
                                    them against their instructions, unless very clearly expressed.
                                    But this bill I do not look upon as a bill for immediate
                                    defense. The present condition of things around us shows that
                                    the people will come up to the defense of the country, even
                                    without such organizations; yet it would be well to have a
                                    military system adopted, with as little expense as possible in
                                    it, under which independent companies may organize, ready to be
                                    called int active service. The regimental and brigade of;
                                    organizations will be of but little use, and great expense. This
                                    bill, sir, is very imperfect in other particulars, but I shall
                                    not allude to them now. I want it understood that I am opposed
                                    to an expensive militia system, but as it seems necessary  to have some law on the
                                    subject, I may feel called on to vote for it, after it is made
                                    as perfect as we can get it.
                                Mr. BLAIR. Although this money does not go into the pockets of
                                    the privates, it goes to defray expenses they must pay unless
                                    provided for out of the State Treasury. And this is a small
                                    pittance to be distributed all over the State. If this money is
                                    not required I suppose it will not be used. It may not be
                                    absolutely necessary that this $70,000 should be kept up every
                                    year, but as long as things are as they are at present we must
                                    look to at least this much expense annually.
                                Mr. NEWCOMB. I am not a champion of this bill, indeed I have
                                    scarcely read all of it, but I wish to answer some of the
                                    remarks of the Senator from Harrison, [Mr. Wolfe.] The Senator
                                    says we will have no discipline or drill under this bill. I do
                                    not know how that will be, but I know the bill gives an
                                    opportunity and offers some encouragement to learn. The Senator
                                    also says the privates get no compensation for fifteen days in
                                    which he will have to drill. It don't necessarily take fifteen
                                    days in the year, although there may be four parades and twelve
                                    drills. I do not know how it may be in the country, but I know
                                    what the effect will be in this city. Our companies here have
                                    been organized in a sort of patch-work fashion under the old
                                    law, and they do their drilling at night. And speaking of the
                                    effect of this drilling, we have sent out of these companies
                                    four Captains and an Adjutant who, I venture to say, are not
                                    surpassed by any men in all the companies, each one being well
                                    versed in the duties of their position. We have sent, I suppose,
                                    in the neighborhood of two hundred privates and non commissioned
                                    officers, many of them capable of commanding a company, simply
                                    from the drilling they have received. I know our privates don't
                                    want pay for mustering. I have been applied to repeatedly to get
                                    a bill through the Legislature that would enable them to pay the
                                    rent of their hall. I believe two companies in this city have
                                    been paying $150 a year for a hall to drill in; and their music
                                    costs them something. Under this bill every company will have an
                                    armory. Heretofore men have been in the habit of taking their
                                    arms home with them, and the consequence is all the arms in this
                                    State have been either lost, taken to Pike's Peak or to Oregon.
                                    Where we provide means for an armory and for paying men to take
                                    care of the arms they will be ready for service at any time.
                                    Under this bill we can calculate on 20,000 volunteer militia.
                                    This bill would give a little less than two dollars for each
                                    man. It is provided in the bill that this money shall be
                                    expended "to defray the expenses of company drills and courts
                                    martial, (for this I think it would not take a great deal,) of
                                    armories and music, and for the procurement of equipments and
                                    munitions." It often happens the State is able to send out a
                                    stand of arms when she is not able to send out accoutrements.
                                    When you give it all to them the whole $70,000I have no doubt
                                    more than that much will be paid out by private members of the
                                    companies. There is not a single dollar in the bill appropriated
                                    to an officer that commands these companies. The
                                    Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General, who are to be here,
                                    have the salaries. The only objection I have is to the amount
                                    left in the State Treasury, and the surplus will remain for the
                                    action of the Legislature hereafter. The amount set apart for
                                    the objects contemplated in the bill, it seems to me, is
                                    trifling enough. I know the amount corning to companies in this
                                    city would not come up to their expenses, but it would be an
                                    encouragement, and the balance would be paid out by the
                                    companies. Indianapolis has sent more men in these six regiments
                                    than any county in the State, I guess. We had two Zouave
                                    companies who have gone bodily almost. We had another company of
                                    infantry, whose captain is now with them, gone into the
                                    regiment. And that military spirit that has been created and
                                    encouraged by these volunteer organizations here has led these
                                    men to step into the ranks for the service of the United States.
                                    For these reasons I desire this appropriation shall not be
                                    decreased.
                                Mr. Conley and Mr. Cobb demanded the yeas and nays, and they were
                                    ordered.
                                Mr. WAGNER. It is evident we have no quorum here, and that ends
                                    this session. I shall therefore move we adjourn.
                                This motion was rejected. The demand for the yeas and nays being
                                    withdrawn-
                                On motion of Mr. WOLFE, the Senate passed informally over the
                                    proposed amendments.
                                Mr. RAY moved to amend the eleventh section by striking out the
                                    words "appointed by the Governor," and inserting the words
                                    "elected by the regiment;" so as to make the Colonel and
                                    Lieutenant-Colonel elective officers.
                                The Senate also passed informally over this amendment.
                                On motion by Mr. JOHNSON, the seventh-section was amended by
                                    striking out the word "annually," and inserting in lieu thereof
                                    the words "for the years 1861 and 1862."
                                And then the Senate adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            TUESDAY, May 7, 1861.
                        
                        The House met at 2 o'clock P. M.
                        On motion of Mr. NEBEKER, the reading of the journal of Saturday was
                            dispensed with.
                        Mr. SMITH, of Bartholomew, pointed out an error in this paper's report of
                            the proceedings of Saturday, which attributes to him an explanation and
                            reason for giving an affirmative vote on the passage of the six regiment
                            bill which were made by Mr. Atkinson.
                        Messers. BUNDY, PROW, POLK and KNOWLTON, asked and obtained leave
                            respectively to record their rotes in the negative on the final passage
                            of the six regiment bill last Saturday.
                        Mr. THOMAS had leave to record his vote in the affirmative on said
                            bill.
                        Mr. DOBBINS presented a letter, by C. H. McCarthy, of Dover Hill, Martin
                            county, asking for a law against the organization of marauding bands of
                            robbers, which was read, and the necessity for such legislation being
                            explained by him, it was referred to the Committee on the
                                Judiciary.
                        
                            BANK REMOVAL BILL.
                            The SPEAKER stated the first thing in order  to be the consideration of Mr.
                                Fisher's bank bill (29.)
                            On motion by Mr. FISHER, it was laid on the table.
                        
                        
                            WORK FOR COMMITTEES.
                            On motion by Mr. CRAIN, the bills from the Senate, viz.: The treason
                                bill No. 2, the deputy bill No 8, and the arms distribution bill No.
                                10, were passed the first reading.

                            The Senate joint resolution No. 2, authorizing the Governor to
                                procure medical aid for the troops at Camp Morton, coming up-
                            The report of the yeas and nays thereon was yeas 59, nays 0 - no
                                quorum voting.
                            On the motion of Mr. NEBEKER, a call of the House was ordered and
                                proceeded, till a quorum appeared; and then the vote was reported
                                yeas 69, nays 0 - so the joint resolution was adopted.
                            On motion by Mr. NEBEKER (the rules being suspended for the purpose),
                                the deputy bill (S. 8) was
                                read the second time by title, and referred to the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary.
                        
                        
                            SUPREME COURT.
                            On the motion of Mr. PROSSER, the concur rent resolution of the
                                Senate, (just announced by Mr. Brown, their Secretary,) authorizing
                                the Sheriff of the Supreme Court to hire, at the expense of the
                                State, suitable rooms in the town of Indianapolis for the holding of
                                the May term of the Supreme Court, was taken up and adopted.
                        
                        
                            WORK FOR COMMITTEES.
                            On motion by Mr. BUNDY, (the rules being suspended for the purpose,)
                                the treason bill (S. 5) was taken up and read the second time.
                            Mr. BUNDY submitted a substitute.
                            On motion by Mr. WOODHULL, the bill and proposed amendment were
                                referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
                            On motion by Mr. BUNDY, (the rules being suspended for the purpose,)
                                the treason bill (S. 2) was read the second time and referred to the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary.
                            On motion by Mr. BUNDY, (the rules being suspended for the purpose,)
                                the arms distribution bill [S.
                                    10} was read the second time by title, and referred to the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary.
                        
                        
                            STATUTE FOR LEVEES AND DRAINS.
                            Mr. BUNDY, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                returned Mr. Henrick's bill [20] to repeal the levees and draining
                                act, with a recommendation that said bill be laid on the table: but
                                considering legislation to be expedient on the subject, the
                                committee direct him to report a bill [32] entitled, An act
                                supplemental to the act to authorize the construction of levees and
                                drains, approved June 12, 1852.
                            The report was concurred in, and the bill was passed to the second
                                reading.
                        
                        
                            NORTHERN PRISON.
                            On motion by Mr. SHERMAN, the Governor's message of last Saturday,
                                transmitting a communication from the Directors and Board of Control
                                of the Northern State Prison, was taken up, and the communication
                                was referred to the Committee on Ways and
                                Means.
                        
                        
                            SUBSISTENCE COMMISSIONERS.
                            Mr. FISHER introduced a bill [33] providing a Board of Subsistence
                                Commissioners, and defining their duties; and defining the duties of
                                certain officers therein mentioned; and prescribing punishment for
                                the violation of this act.
                            It was passed to the second reading.
                        
                        
                            BREACH OF PRIVILEGE - VIGILANCE
                                    COMMITTEE.
                            Mr. HORTON submitted the following:
                            WHEREAS, A member of this House has received a threatening
                                communication, purporting to have come from an organization known as
                                the "Vigilance Committee" of this city; AND
                                WHEREAS, Publications have been made in the newspapers of this city
                                showing that such an organization really exists, that some of its
                                objects are to determine in usurpation of the authority of the State
                                and Federal Governments, what articles are to pass through the
                                depots of this city as legitimate commerce, and what are to be
                                obstructed as contraband of war, also to establish a censorship over
                                the press of the city, dictating what articles shall appear, and
                                usurping the lawful authority in determining what sentiments shall
                                constitute sedition or treason; also, that said organization has had
                                a tender of an organization of troops known as the "Dumont Guards,"
                                ostensibly to aid them in carrying out their designs;
                            AND WHEREAS, It is understood from intimations in the press, as well
                                as from other sources of information, that said organization propose
                                to establish a system of espionage upon the conduct of peaceful and
                                respectable citizens, threatening their lives and the destruction of
                                their property, if their conduct does not accord with the arbitrary
                                standard erected by them;
                            AND WHEREAS, In one instance the Governor has found it necessary to
                                protect the property of citizens of this city, against the threats
                                of the said Vigilance Committee, by mounting a
                                large guard of soldiers for that purpose; therefore -
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That a committee of five be
                                            appointed by this House, with power to send for persons
                                            and papers, and to examine witnesses under oath,
                                            touching the existence, membership and objects of said
                                            Committee; and that said committee be instructed to sit
                                            from day to day until said examination is completed, and
                                            to report to the House the evidence that may be
                                            elicited.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. HORTON. Mr. Speaker, I trust that this subject is of sufficient
                                importance to present itself to the minds of gentlemen at once. It
                                hardly needs illustration. It is detailed in the opening of the
                                resolutions, that there is a member of this House whose personal
                                liberty and rights have been invaded by threats. Under these
                                circumstances, it seems to me that there is an urgent necessity for
                                the adoption of the resolution - that each member, for his own
                                protection from violence, as well as for the protection of peaceable
                                citizens, should be ready to vote for this resolution, and the
                                appointment of the Committee it proposes to create.
                            Mr. PACKARD. It seems to me this is no trifling matter. If gentlemen
                                will examine the journal of this House, they will find that there is
                                occasion for this resolution, and they will see, also, that the
                                necessity for such action as the resolution proposes, has been
                                shadowed forth by the press of this city. Sir, we live now in a time
                                of civil commotiona time when it is likely that disturbers of the
                                peace will arise, unless they are sternly discouraged. We live in a
                                time when men are liable to become somewhat reckless, and in such
                                times it becomes necessary to throw strong guards around the citizen
                                to protect the sacred rights of person and property, secured and
                                guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, and of our own
                                State. I do not believe that there is one good citizen of this city
                                that would injure or invade or abridge the personal
                        
                    
                
                
                

                    BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS,
                    BY ARIEL, & W. H. DRAPIER.
                    
                        Vol. V.
                        INDIANAPOLIS, MAY 13, 1861.
                        NO. 6.
                    

                    
                        
                            rights of any other peaceful citizen, and I certainly do not believe
                                that the personal rights of the members of this body are in danger
                                from our fellow-citizens here. But, sir, such a thing has, been
                                threatened. Threats of violence have been made against a member of
                                this House from a source calling itself a Vigilance
                                    Committee. "We are informed through the press that
                                there is such an organization as a Vigilance
                                    Committee in this city. Have we not seen both in the
                                    Indianapolis Journal and in the State Sentinel, that there has been a formal tender to
                                that Vigilance Committee, of the services of an
                                armed body of troops to aid that organization in carrying out its
                                objects? I can not see why the raising of this committee can be
                                objected to. The object is the protection of the rights of members
                                of this body, and the preservation of the public peace. A
                                proposition to investigate any source of public danger, can not
                                reflect upon any honest man. An honest man is not afraid of
                                investigation. If the public peace is threatened it is our duty to
                                inquire into the matter. We can all remember that reign of terror
                                which was inaugurated in San Francisco, California, by a
                                    Vigilance Committee there, which doubtless
                                sprung from resources as significant as that before us,and what was
                                the result? There was a complete overturning of law and order. Even
                                the lives of peaceful citizens were endangered, and terror pervaded
                                the city just as long as they usurped the power of the law. "With
                                such an example in our country, sir, it is impossible to say what
                                results might not follow from the irresponsible action of a
                                    Vigilance Committee anywhere in our midst. If
                                we look back on the French Revolution we find all the horrors of
                                that revolution growing out of the ascendancy of a
                                    Vigilance Committee in the city of Paris -
                                acts of lawless violence and scenes of terror too horrible for
                                description. But it may be that the objects of the organization of
                                this committee are fair and honorable. If so, they will not
                                themselves object to investigation. Mr. Speaker, to show you that
                                the apprehensions set forth in the resolution are not without
                                foundation, I would refer you to the action of the Governor, the
                                Executive of the State, who has found it necessary to place a heavy
                                guard in one of the buildings of this city for its protection. I
                                understand that last Sunday night the Governor ordered a guard to be
                                stationed in the Sentinel Building to protect it
                                from an apprehended attack. "Would the Governor have done that if he
                                had not believed there was danger at hand? Should the apprehensions
                                and the judgment of the Governor be disregarded in such a case? I
                                say no, Mr. Speaker. I say it is the duty of this body to
                                investigate the matter. If there is an organization in this city
                                with a view to overturn the laws, obstructing the rights of
                                commerce, or in any manner going beyond the legal rights of the
                                citizen, I say it is our duty to investigate the matter and stop it
                                in its very infancy.
                            Mr. CRAIN. Mr. Speaker, I am not aware that we are sitting here to
                                investigate what people are doing out of doors. There may be
                                    Vigilance Committees in other towns, and if
                                we were to undertake here to investigate them, I think we might have
                                a good time of it. I doubt whether there is not, at this time, a
                                    Vigilance Committee, in some sense, in every
                                town in the State; and it seems to me simply absurd for this body to
                                attempt the investigation of a Vigilance
                                    Committee in this city, if there be one. Sir, we have
                                laws for the State of Indiana; and certainly this House does not
                                undertake to enforce the laws. It is unnecessary. The gentleman
                                talks about a certain building being guarded. I know nothing about
                                that, nor do I care. I suppose this city has laws and a police
                                force; and I suppose it is their province to take care that they are
                                executed; and not that this House should raise a Committee to
                                investigate Vigilance Committees for them. I say
                                again, that I do not know that there is a Vigilance
                                    Committee here, but I know there are
                                    Vigilance Committees in other towns of the
                                State; and I know that they are necessary in some places, as was
                                shown by the letter just now presented from his county by the
                                gentleman from Martin, [Mr. Dobbins.] And I repeat, that it is
                                sometimes necessary to provide for the public safety in this manner,
                                if the police cannot do it. I think that it is not our province to
                                interfere; for if it was, we might have to send a Committee to
                                Evansville, Lafayette, and other places. I hope the House will not
                                entertain for a moment the idea of passing any such resolution as
                                this.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN. (Mr. Jones of Tippecanoe in the Chair.) Mr.
                                Speaker: I regret that this resolution has been introduced. I do so,
                                be cause the preamble sets out by assuming that there is an
                                unauthorized and illegal body of men organized in this town for the
                                purpose of doing unauthorized and illegal acts, and then closes with
                                a resolution which would make this Legislature guilty of an act of
                                usurpation - an act which, by the Constitution, we have no right to
                                do. The preamble to the resolution assumes lawlessness on the part
                                of a body in this town, and then the resolution asks the Legislature
                                to recognize such  lawlessness
                                by doing itself an act which it has no power to do. We are told by
                                the gentleman from Marshall [Mr. Packard] that under the dread of
                                this Vigilance Committee it has become necessary
                                to set a guard for the protection of the property of one of the
                                citizens of this town. I ask the gentleman if the property has been
                                disturbed by that mob? and if it has I would ask him further, if
                                this Legislature would have any power what-ever to legislate with
                                reference to the matter? The only way in which acts of lawless
                                violence can be punished is through the interposition of our courts.
                                The citizen whose rights are invaded or trampled under foot must
                                appeal to the law for redress, and to the law alone. I ask the
                                gentleman who introduced the resolution what power this House has to
                                make the proposed investigation? Suppose all the facts were duly
                                reported and attested to the House, as cited in this preamble, can
                                the House punish such acts? or can the House pass an ex
                                    post facto law, and prescribe punishment after the offense
                                is committed? Again, I ask the gentleman if the committee should be
                                appointed has the Legislature the power to confer upon a committee
                                the power to administer the requisite oaths to take the testimony in
                                the case? Suppose a Vigilance Committee exists in
                                this city - I know not if there is one; and suppose Mr. A., a
                                citizen here, is called to testify as to whether there is such an
                                organization, has this House the power to compel the witness to
                                testify to the point? Suppose the case were in a court of justice,
                                and a party is brought in and required to testify in a matter that
                                implicates himself, can the court compel him to testify? and has the
                                House greater power in such a case than the courts? Has the House
                                the power to authorize investigations of unauthorized, illegal
                                bodies of men? I assume that it has not; but its province is
                                legislation, and it is the province of the courts to investigate and
                                punish crime. Now, so far as the protection of the members of this
                                body is concerned, there is no question but that the House may take
                                such necessary steps to arraign and punish as may be expedient, if
                                the personal liberty of any of its members be placed in jeopardy;
                                but then the case must be fully presented, as to the facts, before
                                the House would be authorized to entertain a motion. The House would
                                not have power to appoint a committee to inquire whether Mr. A. is
                                in any danger of having his liberty or his person violated; until
                                the fact shall have been made apparent the House can not inquire. It
                                is certain then that the House has no right to inquire into the
                                objects and intentions of bodies of men, whether they call
                                themselves Vigilance Committees, or by any other
                                name. As remarked by the gentleman from Parke, (Mr. Crain,) if you
                                start out to inquire after the objects and purposes of
                                    Vigilance Committees, there is no telling
                                where it will end. I am quite certain, if there is a
                                    Vigilance Committee in this town, the entire
                                tinue of the session might be fruitlessly consumed in the matter of
                                inquiring into it. Now suppose a party should undertake to prevent
                                the shipping of provisions from the depot, have not the shippers
                                their remedy at law? Can the Legislature declare that they shall be
                                punished? or that their organization shall cease to exist? Have we
                                not tribunals organized by laws under the Constitution? and have not
                                these tribunals the sole power to investigate all violations of the
                                rights of citizens? Then let not the Legislature usurp the power of
                                the courts, but if parties suffer damage from such causes let them
                                appeal to the proper tribunals, and let not this Legislature guilty
                                of usurpation.
                            Mr. DOBBINS had no doubt as to the power of the House to protect its
                                members. The city of Indianapolis was responsible for the acts of
                                this Vigilance Committee. He was governed in his
                                action here solely by his own judgment, and stood responsible to the
                                people of the county of Martin, and when the people of that county
                                shall find that he had failed to represent them as he ought, he was
                                ready to go home. He understood that one of the objects of this
                                    Vigilance Committee was to control the action
                                and judgment of members on this floor; and, so far as that was
                                concerned, he was ready to vote for the investigation. He would let
                                that body know that they can not control his judgment. Outside of
                                that he did not think we had any business with them. So far as
                                regards the anonymous threats that have been made against members,
                                he was ready and anxious for the investigation.
                            Mr. FISHER. I deprecate, as much as any member can, these anonymous
                                letters to members of this House. I admit that Vigilance
                                    Committees may be necessary under some peculiar
                                circumstance, but in all cases where they are not necessary, they
                                are an intolerable nuisance. Whenever they undertake to influence
                                members of this House they are entirely out of character. No
                                circumstance will justify that. And if that is to be continued and
                                the attempt should be made to control the Legislature by violence,
                                the only way to avoid it is by adjourning to some other place. But
                                as it respects this inquiry, the proposition is to raise a
                                committee, with power to send for persons and papers. This will
                                unquestionably result in a very large expenditure of money, and I am
                                unable to see any possible good that can grow out of it. You may
                                find that there is a Vigilance Committee; you may
                                find that such a letter as that read here last Saturday was written;
                                but you will hardly find evidence that any body of men is
                                responsible for it. Any man might write such a paper - it might be
                                some individual wanting to play smart. I was disposed to think, when
                                it was read Saturday, that some person was endeavoring to play off a
                                hoax. I did not regard it as a serious thing. But suppose it was all
                                that is claimed for it, my opinion is that it has failed to produce
                                the result intended. I do not suppose that there is a member on this
                                floor whose vote or action is to be influenced by a paper of that
                                kind in the slightest degree. I do not feel disposed to boast of my
                                courage, for it has never been tried - I never had a fight in my
                                life - but it seems to me that I should have no more fears about
                                such a paper as that, than though it were a piece of blank paper.
                                And I presume the gentleman from Bartholomew had no fears about it.
                                I presume he has not thought of personal violence from that source;
                                and I presume he never could be influenced by any such threats in
                                the course of action he adopts here. I can gee no good, sir, to grow
                                out of this investigation. It seems to me that the appointment of
                                     this committee would be
                                treating the matter with ore seriousness than it deserves. I think
                                the best way is to treat it with perfect contempt.
                            Mr. BUNDY was not here on Saturday, when the gentleman from
                                Bartholomew submitted the letter in question. This was the only
                                attempt that had been brought to light in which any show of a
                                disposition had been made to influence the action of this House. So
                                far as that letter goes it was a breach of privilege. For if there
                                is anything sacred in a representative government it is the right of
                                a man to speak and vote here, being responsible alone to his
                                constituents. His people had elected him to represent them, and if
                                he fails he must answer to them and to nobody else. I am impressed,
                                however, that too much dignity and importance will be given this
                                thing. We are getting up an investigation - perhaps an expensive
                                investigation in time and money for the purpose of finding out
                                whether that letter was written for the purpose of intimidation. If
                                it be the act of an individual; Mr. Speaker, I am happy to inform
                                the House and country that the gentleman from Bartholomew is
                                abundantly able to protect himself. He can go it safe upon his own
                                muscle. As to that branch of the resolution to which the gentleman
                                from Marshall and Starke spoke at length, that is going beyond the
                                province of this House. I refer to that branch of the resolution
                                which look to the fact of the hindrance of property from peaceably
                                passing over the public roads and highways. It is the business of
                                the courts of law, created by the authority of this House under the
                                constitution, to protect all persons in their rights of property;
                                that is not at all the business of this House. Then, sir, I am
                                impressed with the belief that in this good city of
                                Indiandianapolis, so famed for its churches, and in past time at
                                least, famous also for its morality and religion, its republicanism
                                and respect for the laws, there is no need for such a supervision by
                                this body. And if I knew that such an irresponsible body as a
                                    Vigilance Committee did exist here, I should
                                still be constrained to vote against any resolution of this kind.
                                But if it were made apparent to me that any member of this House
                                needs protection, I should go as far as any man to protect him in
                                the exercise of all his rights and privileges here. These sacred
                                rights of representatives have been seduously guarded ever since
                                legislative assemblies have been convened. It is the right of
                                speaking and acting and owing responsibility alone to his
                                constituents. Whenever I shall find that this right has been
                                infringed upon, as the representative of a free people, I shall be
                                as ready as any member to show to the community that the members of
                                this House are to stay here and do the business of the people
                                without being responsible to any power except that which has sent
                                them here. I am obliged, however, to think that gentlemen have
                                exhibited too much sensitiveness about this, and seeing no other
                                occasion for investigation, I shall feel constrained to vote against
                                the resolution.
                            Mr. PACKARD. When we are assured that there is such an organization,
                                and when, as I might say, they were backed up with troops, I say
                                then that it becomes a question of importance. When an organized
                                body of soldiers tender their services to the Vigilance
                                    Committee for the purpose of carrying out their
                                objects, it then becomes necessary for the Legislature, whose
                                members have been menaced with its power, to investigate the objects
                                of that committee. Some further importance, also, should be attached
                                to this matter from the fact that the Governor has been obliged to
                                order a guard for the protection of property.
                            Mr. BUNDY. Has the Legislature the power to protect the property of
                                private individuals?
                            Mr. PACKARD. I suppose not. But that resolution sets forth these
                                facts in order to show the lawless character of this committee, and
                                that therefore its threats ought to receive a due amount of
                                attention. The very fact that it has arrested attention outside of
                                this House calls for action here. These things are set forth in the
                                preamble for the purpose of showing that the body is of some
                                magnitude. As far as the right of examining witnesses is concerned,
                                I can not see any difficulty about that.
                            Mr. CASON. Suppose, upon investigation, you should find every thing
                                as charged against this committee true, in what manner would you
                                punish parties?
                            Mr. PACKARD. I will answer you in the true Yankee manner. How would
                                you protect this body from a mob threatening violence? Why, simply
                                by becoming informed with respect to the mob, and then by being able
                                to ward off all approach of danger. I say then again that we hare an
                                undoubted right to investigate with respect to any invasion of the
                                personal rights of members of this House. And we have a right to
                                examine witnesses under oath. The gentleman from Henry [Mr. Bundy]
                                says the gentleman from Bartholomew [Mr. Smith] is physically able
                                to resist any man that may attack him, but neither the gentleman
                                from Bartholomew, nor any other man, is able to resist the midnight
                                assassin.
                            Mr. SMITH of Bartholomew remembered that this matter was treated
                                lightly, and recited his conversation about the Vigilance
                                    Committee on Saturday in the Sentinel office; that he came immediately down to the
                                State House, and within twenty minutes afterwards he received the
                                letter. He did not dread the prowess of any one man, but perhaps he
                                could not stand against a mob. But, as Prentice said once to a mob,
                                he knew that a thousand men could destroy hie property, but select
                                out one man and I'll fight him all the way though. So far as his
                                personal security was concerned he did ask for any better body guard
                                than the Republican members on this floor.
                            Mr. McCLURG. Certainly no man deprecated more than he the attempt to
                                intimidate any member on this floor; but it seemed to him that there
                                is something in this resolution that could not be legitimately
                                carried out. It seemed to him that its adoption would be a nugatory
                                act of legislation. Suppose this committee of investigation to be
                                formed, and it would be ascertained by them that there was a
                                    Vigilance Committee, banded for unlawful
                                objects, what control would this House have over the matter? Till
                                some act is committed nothing could be done. No court could have
                                jurisdiction before the act. How then could this House recognize
                                intentions. It was in the power of this body to pass an expost facto law. Certainly that portion of the resolution
                                which  looks to the
                                investigation of intentions was clearly nugatory. If everything
                                sought after could be found out, even then the resolution would be
                                nugatory.
                            Mr. FORD recommended that every member in danger from
                                    Vigilance Committees turn himself, also, into
                                a Vigilance Committee and take care of himself.
                                [Laughter.]
                            Mr. ORR concurred in the views of those opposed to the adoption of
                                the resolution.
                            Mr. KENDRICK. I do not think we need be scared over this. I am
                                acquainted with the people of Indianapolis, and I satisfied that
                                they are a safe people.
                            Mr. BOBBINS. Does the gentleman think that all the people in
                                Indianapolis will be saved?
                            Mr. KENDRICK. I am not so certain that all the people in Indianapolis
                                will be saved; neither am I certain that all the members of this
                                House will be saved, I think these are very doubtful questions. I am
                                certain as to the people in and about Indianapolis, they wish to
                                respect and carry out the laws of the land; and if members continued
                                to treat the citizens of Indianapolis with respect they will not be
                                harmed. That I am willing to vouch for. I think, therefore, that on
                                this subject, brethren, we ought to be dried up; [laughter,] and if
                                any man has personal fears let him adopt the sentiment of the
                                gentleman from Jackson, [Mr. Ford] to resolve himself into a
                                committee of one and take care of himself.
                            Mr. WOOD was satisfied that there were people here attaching undue
                                importance to this vigilance committee. The
                                letter referred to might not have been written by the committee.
                                There were such committees all over the State, organized under the
                                promptings of the purest patriot ism. On his motion the resolution
                                was laid on the table.
                            Mr. BINGHAM submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the injunction of
                                            secrecy resting upon the proceedings of the House of
                                            Representatives of the 27th of April, ultimo, is
                                            removed, so far as to admit the publication of the
                                            action with closed doors on the bill No. 12, and the
                                            joint resolution submitted by Mr. Lane.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            ADJOURNMENT TO A DAY CERTAIN.
                            Mr. WILKINSON submitted a resolution to adjourn the session from
                                Thursday the 9th, to Tuesday the 28th of May - members of the
                                General Assembly to receive mileage, but no per
                                    diem during said recess.
                            Mr. FISHER moved to refer the resolution to the Committee on
                                    the Judiciary, with instructions to inquire as to
                                whether the time between the day of adjournment and reassembling
                                will be counted in the forty days during which the Legislature is
                                allowed to be in session.
                            Mr. PARRETT. Having done what we ought to do, he thought we ought to
                                adjourn, and remain at home, subject to the call of the Governor -
                                adjourn sine die, and not to a day certain. He
                                hoped the resolution would go to the committee and that the
                                committee would keep it there till we get ready to adjourn and go
                                home like sensible men.
                            The motion was agreed to and the resolution referred accordingly.
                        
                        
                            SUPERINTENDENTS OF BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS.
                            Mr. VEATCH asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill [34] entitled
                                an Act fixing the term of office of the Superintendent of the
                                Hospital for the Insane, and the Superintendents of the Asylum for

                                the election therefor shall be held.
                            It was passed to the second reading.
                            Mr. BUNDY moved a suspension of the rules and constitutional

                                bill, whereupon the Constitution requires that the yeas and nays
                                shall be recorded. But no quorum voting.

                            Enrolled Act No. 12, of the Senate.

                                dollars borrowed by the Governor, Auditor and Treasurer of State,
                                raised to assume and provide for the payment of money by the
                                State.
                            SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the
                                    State of Indiana, That whereas it becomes necessary, in
                                order to comply with the requisition for troops recently made by the
                                President of the United States, to procure a large sum of money for
                                the use of the State, before the General Assembly could be convened;
                                and whereas, the Governor and the Auditor, Treasurer and Secretary
                                of State, upon their own private credit and responsibility, borrowed
                                from the branch, at Indianapolis, of the Bank of the State of
                                Indiana, for the use of the State, the sum of twenty-five thousand
                                dollars, to be expended for and on behalf of the State in paying the
                                expenses incurred and to be incurred, in raising and sustaining
                                troops in compliance with the said requisition of the President; and
                                whereas, the Governor and other officers of the State aforesaid,
                                gave their promisory note for said money, dated April 17, 1861,
                                payable on demand, to the order of C. L. Stevenson, Cashier of said
                                branch bank, with interest; and to secure the payment of said note,
                                the said Auditor of State deposited in said Branch Bank five per
                                cent, bonds of the State of Indiana to the amount of thirty thousand
                                dollars; therefore the borrowing of the said sum of twenty-five
                                thousand dollars and the depositing of said bonds as security for
                                the payment thereof, as above recited, are hereby declared to be
                                legal and binding upon the State of Indiana, and the debt contracted
                                as aforesaid is hereby assumed, and shall be paid by the State of
                                Indiana out of the contingent fund of the Governor, appropriated by
                                the General Assembly for the purpose of defraying the expenses of
                                responding to the proclamation of the President of the United States
                                for troops; and if no funds specifically provided for the purpose of
                                paying said debts should be in the treasury when it becomes
                                necessary to pay the same, then the said debt shall be paid out of
                                any money that may be in the treasury and not otherwise specifically
                                appropriated.
                            SEC. 2. There is an emergency which requires that this act shall take
                                effect immediately - and it is therefore enacted that it shall take
                                effect and be in force from and after its passage.

                            WEDNESDAY, May 8, 1861.
                        
                        Mr. CULVER, in presenting a series of resolutions demanding at the hands
                            of the Legislature a large body of armed soldiers, unanimously adopted
                            at a meeting of the citizens of Tippecanoe county, held in the city of
                            Lafayette last Saturday, said: Mr. President, I wish to say one word. It
                            was understood in Lafayette on Saturday that the six regiment bill was
                            about to fail, upon which a large meeting came together and this is the
                            deliberations of the meeting. They are in favor in the county I
                            represent, thank God, of voting every dollar necessary for carrying on
                            the war; and this is the universal feeling of the country. Those that
                            have no money are willing to go to war, and those that have money and
                            stay at home are willing to pay the expense. I move to refer the
                            resolutions to the Committee on Military Affairs.
                        The motion was agreed to.
                        Mr. MARCH, in presenting the resolutions of a meeting held in Selma,
                            Delaware county, on Saturday last, pledging lives, property and honor to
                            the maintainance of the Constitution and laws of the country, said: I
                            only wish to say that these resolutions were adopted at a large meeting
                            of the citizens of a portion of the county I have the honor to
                            represent; and these resolutions I have no doubt represent the views not
                            only of that meeting but of the entire county; I may say men, women and
                            children, without distinction of party. They are ready to do every thing
                            and contribute every thing they have now or may have hereafter for the
                            purpose of perpetuating our Constitution and maintaining the flag of our
                            country. I move the resolutions be referred to the Committee on
                                Military Affairs.
                        The motion was agreed to.
                        
                            CONTRABAND ARTICLES.
                            Mr RAY offered the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, by the Senate, (the House
                                            concurring,) That a committee of five be appointed - two
                                            on the part of the Senate and three on the part of the
                                            House - to confer with the District Attorney and the
                                            Marshal of the United States for the District of
                                            Indiana, on the power and expediency of those officers
                                            interposing to prevent the sale and shipment of arms,
                                            munitions, provisions, and other articles contraband of
                                            war, from this State, to the people of any other State
                                            in rebellion to the authority of the United States, and
                                            report at an early day.
                                    
                                
                            
                            After a few remarks by Messrs. RAY, MURRAY and ANTHONY -
                            The resolution was adopted.
                            Subsequently the PRESIDENT appointed Mr. Ray and Mr. Wagner the
                                committee on the part of the Senate.
                        
                        
                            A VISIT FROM THE KENTUCKY LEGISLATURE.
                            Mr. SLACK offered a resolution calling upon the committee to whom was
                                referred his joint resolution [No. 5] of Friday, to report the same
                                back to the Senate; but after explanations from several members of
                                the committee, setting forth the fact that they were absent from the
                                city during the recess from Saturday till yesterday, and of course
                                could not act upon the matter, he withdrew it.
                        
                        
                            A PETITION FOR MORE REGIMENTS.

                                motion, to the Committee on Military Affairs:

                                            To the Senate and House of
                                                Representatives:
                                        
                                        GENTLEMEN: - At a mass meeting held at the court house in
                                            this city last evening, resolutions were offered and an
                                            unanimous vote taken requesting your honorable body to
                                            pass a bill to raise ten more regiments of volunteers to
                                            protect our State during the war which must soon be on
                                            hand Our men pledge their fortunes, lastly their lives,
                                            in defense of our Union against the dastardly hands of
                                            traitors.
                                        A committee was appointed to confer with your honorable
                                            body, consisting of REV. J. B. NEW, JAMES BLAKE, DR. W.
                                            C. THOMPSON, JAMES SULGROVE, ANDREW WALLACE.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            STATIONERY USED BY MEMBERS.
                            The PRESIDENT laid before the Senate a communication from the State
                                Librarian setting forth the amount of paper, pens, pencils, quills,
                                &c., &c., &c., drawn from the Librarian by written
                                orders of Senators since the commencement of the session, in
                                compliance with a resolution of this body directing such a statement
                                to be made every two weeks. The statement was read and referred to
                                the Committee on Finance.
                        
                        
                            REORGANIZATION OF THE MILITIA.
                            The PRESIDENT now announced the order to be the consideration of the
                                unfinished business of yesterday - the militia bill, H. R. 21, with
                                amendments there - to passed over informally yesterday afternoon for
                                lack of a quorum to act thereon.
                            Mr. CRAVEN. Upon consideration, I do not think $70,000 is too much to
                                be appropriated as a fund for military purposes. If it is found to
                                be too light, we can increase it; and if too much, then we can make
                                it lighter. This bill is, perhaps, in as good shape as we can get
                                it. I do not think there is any time for delay now. I look upon the
                                appropriation of $70,000 as being light; it is only some twenty-five
                                or thirty cents a day to a man. I therefore move to reconsider the
                                vote by which the Senate adopted the amendment of the Senator from
                                Putnam [Mr. Johnston] striking out the word "annually." The section,
                                as amended, now only appropriates $35,000 for the year 1862 and the
                                same amount for the year 1863.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON. The object of my amendment was simply to appropriate
                                only for the next two years, until the next Legislature should meet,
                                and not to interfere with the amount at all. I have no objection to
                                amending it so as to insert the word "annually," which would obviate
                                the objection of the Senator.
                            On motion by Mr. LINE, and by unanimous consent, the word "annually"
                                was placed in section 7.
                            Mr. ANTHONY moved to lay the pending amendments (offered yesterday)
                                on the table.
                            Mr. RAY demanded a division of the question.
                            The amendment (Mr. Dickinson's) was not laid on the table by yeas 14,
                                nays 26.
                            The amendment to the amendment (Mr. Cobb's) was laid on the table by
                                yeas 32, nays 7.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. I was not here when the discussion took place on this
                                amendment; but I must confess I regret to see a disposition to
                                eviserate or take the bowels out of it. I do not pretend to be a
                                military man, and I presume 
                                most of the Senators are about on a par with myself in reference to
                                this matter. As a matter of course I make some honorable exceptions
                                those military men acting under a commission. I always thought it a
                                dangerous thing for a man to tamper with what he does not know
                                anything about. When meddling with this system we may destroy its
                                entire harmony, and I presume this bill was gotten up with a view to
                                a whole and perfect system. If we cut down this sum to $40,000 there
                                must necessarily be a great many other amendments made to the bill
                                in order to make it uniform. I presume the committee have got up the
                                bill with a view to the appropriation of $70,000 to carry out its
                                provisions; and I apprehend that that is not a very large
                                sum to put on toot in active organization a militia that will number
                                from 75,000 to 100,000 men. I think we are legislating here in the
                                most niggardly manner possible. I can not find a single State, North
                                or South, that is going upon the parsimonious policy of the
                                Legislature of Indiana; and when say this I say it with the
                                understanding that we are to pay the debts we contract, and I say it
                                with the understanding of the wishes and feelings of my
                                constituents, who bear as large a portion of the burden as any other
                                portion of the State in proportion to their population. I say I
                                represent a constituency that pays more in proportion to their
                                numbers than any other member upon this floor, and I am willing that
                                constituency shall be taxed. I am willing they shall be taxed
                                because they are willing to be tared to support a liberal policy, in
                                view of the exigency of the times. We find that the Legislature of
                                Tennessee has made an appropriation of $2,500,000 unconditionally,
                                and $3,000,000 conditionally, and called out 55,000 volunteers. "Now
                                we need not calculate on all this as mere bravado. We need not
                                calculate that we are to meet an army with corn stalks; that this
                                thing is to be mere child's play. We need not calculate to get all
                                this trouble "without some sacrifice, and we need not think we can
                                intimidate the South by such paltry appropriations as this. Indiana
                                perhaps is, in a military point of view, in a worse condition than
                                any State in this Union. As far as a military organization is
                                concerned she has none, and has never had one worthy the character
                                and dignity of the State. We have not got now in the State of
                                Indiana one man in fifty that knows the first military command. And
                                why is it? Because Indiana was inclined to pursue a policy
                                heretofore that she today must regret. Take Massachusetts, under the
                                direction of Governor Banks, who infused a military spirit at some
                                considerable expense, take them to-day and they are able to respond
                                to the proclamation of the President, not only with untrained
                                soldiers, but with men that take rank at once with the drilled
                                soldiers of the army; and I am inclined to think that one regiment
                                of that kind of men are worth four of raw recruits. It is absolutely
                                criminal for us to stand here and allow the State to go without a
                                military law - to send such recruits into the field for mere
                                slaughter. And I say the blood of thousands of Indiana's sons will
                                be upon the skirts of Senators upon this floor if they adopt this
                                policy. What Senator, if he were a private in a company, would be
                                willing to put himself under the control of a captain or a colonel
                                who has had no military training? But you can not expect men to
                                devote their time in organizing the militia for nothing. They can
                                not afford to do it. A large majority of the citizens of Indiana
                                have got either to work or steal; for the laboring class compose
                                nine-tenths of our population.
                            A VOICE. "They might do some begging."
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. In the name of God who wants to send our citizens out
                                begging?
                            Mr. COBB. By this bill do you not compel the citizens to uniform
                                themselves at much expense and spend as much time as the
                                officer?
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. I am not familiar with the provisions of this bill. If
                                it does I am willing to add another $70,000, and pay them at least
                                one dollar for every day they are in the field.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB. We have heard the statement made here that pay is
                                provided for officers in this bill. If any gentleman will find such
                                a provision I will vote against it.
                            Mr. MELLETT. "The only officers paid are the Adjutant-General and the
                                Quartermaster-General.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB. They are not over the troops at all.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. They only receive $800 a year, and that is a very small
                                sum. But I am glad the Senator from Lawrence [Mr. Cobb] put the
                                interrogatory he did, because I would like to see this bill
                                perfected. I would like to see the common soldiers receive not less
                                than one dollar per day, for I know no common laborer can live in my
                                county, unless upon a farm, at less than one dollar a day. Every one
                                gets at least that, and I know it requires ninety-nine cents of that
                                dollar to maintain his family. I will never ask a man to devote
                                himself to his country or labor for my purposes for less than that
                                sum. If there is an amendment made to this bill it ought to be that.
                                But don't take out this $70,000. We have no right ask a man to give
                                us his labor for the protection of a community. Let the men that own
                                the property pay for it. I am inclined to think the masses of the
                                people are far in advance of the politicians, for they want this
                                Legislature to act liberally; they demand at the hands of their
                                public servants liberal appropriations and prudential expenditure. A
                                niggardly and parsimonious policy will not meet the demand of the
                                people and the times. Liberty is priceless - and while we should be
                                prudent we should not weigh the lives and liberties of the people in
                                the scales with gold. Let Indiana show to the world by her liberal
                                and patriotic policy that she appreciates the value of this liberty,
                                bequeated us by the heroes of the revolution, and the government
                                handed down to us by the sages of that terrible conflict.
                            Mr. SHIELDS. I agree with the Senator generally, but there is a
                                theory I think he is mistaken about. The gentleman refers to how
                                much more efficient the Massachusetts troops are than those in
                                Indiana. I deny every word of it. Take the troops from our cities as
                                those in Massachusetts were - take the Zouave regiment and they will
                                compare well with the regular troops in their drill; they will show
                                that they are not, as the gentleman says, entirely ignorant of the
                                drill. We have but few large cities, therefore we have but few
                                troops that have been well drilled. In regard to  the pay of men that drill in the
                                country, I hold that every man pledges himself to be a guard from
                                the time he is eighteen years of age till he is forty-five. I want
                                the expenses of the camp paid by the property or money of the
                                country. Where is the State that has paid for military services in
                                time of peace? None. We had better be careful how we adopt a
                                military system for fear the people may trample it under their feet.
                                I would oppose any bill that proposes to pay a man for mustering
                                fifteen times a year. It would cost a million and a half dollars.
                                But the great defect is the lack of a military school in our State.
                                There is not a dollar in this State to provide far a military
                                school. I would have a provision in it putting every high school in
                                the State, at Greencastle, Blooomington, the high schools in this
                                city belonging to the Christians, at Franklin, and at
                                Crawfordsville, I would put them all in the way to give every child
                                in the State a military education.
                            Mr. MELLETT. I have not been informed by any Senator who proposes to
                                cut down this appropriation that the amount is too large, and I
                                should like to hear some Senator demonstrate that. It is thought
                                proper that there should be encampments of brigades and smaller
                                encampments, and as a matter of course that takes a good deal of
                                money. It is not supposed that young men will want to charge a per diem for time lost in training; but it can not
                                be expected that in addition they would incur the necessary expenses
                                of these encampments. Now one-fourth of this fund is set apart to
                                pay the salaries of the Adjutant and Quartermaster Generals, and to
                                pay the expenses of State and brigade encampments, and brigade
                                courts martial, &c. Now the question should be, is one-fourth
                                too much? What amount of money is it going to cost? Are these
                                encampments necessary? &c. The State must spend enough money to
                                make the institution respectable, and the soldiers will cheerfully
                                uniform themselves, and devote their time to training. I am
                                satisfied $70,000 would be a small sum if we make the system
                                efficient, and $5,000 would be a large sum if we did not. I hope the
                                bill, in this respect, will not be amended.
                            Mr. SLACK. The Senator says if any man will demonstrate the fact that
                                $70,000 is too much to appropriate under this bill he will help vote
                                it down. He also says there are but two salaried officers provided
                                for in this bill, and that $800 per year a piece is not too much.
                                Well that makes $1,600; now what is he going to do with the $68,400
                                left?
                            Mr. MELLETT. I would ask the gentleman how much it would cost to keep
                                40,000 men but two or three or four days in camp and away from
                                home?
                            Mr. SLACK. There is no use in these encampments. I regard it more as
                                a horse race or a place to have a spree than anything else. No good
                                grows out of them. The people don't want them; they don't ask for
                                them, and they won't hare them. I am willing to vote all the money
                                necessary for paying these two officials in order that they may
                                discharge their duties properly, but to take $70,000 and scatter it
                                over the State uselessly appears to me to be nonsense, utter
                                nonsense.
                            Mr. ANTHONY. Where are the armories?
                            Mr. SLACK. Well, how much will an armory cost? Can't you rent an
                                armory any wherein this State for three or four hundred dollars a
                                year? And can't we have an armory without having two fellows with
                                crossed bayonets at the doors, who make you tell your name and then
                                report it inside before you are admitted? All such humbugs as that I
                                have no patience with. I speak of these gentlemen who are placed
                                around these doors in this building with crossed bayonets; it is a
                                consumate humbug. The Adjutant-General is no more an officer than
                                any other State officer, and there is not half as much necessity for
                                a guard at his door that there is at the door of the Treasurer of
                                State. [Consent.] If the gentleman from Henry [Mr. Mellett] will
                                show to me necessity of spending $70,000 for the purpose of carrying
                                on a military system in this State, then I will vote with him. But I
                                am opposed to the whole thing and shall vote against it.
                            Mr. ANTHONY. I wish to exhibit a few figures if not facts in
                                reference to this matter. I will suppose that there are ready to 'be
                                enrolled under this bill 170,000 men. I will put it though at
                                100,000. Say there are 100 men in each company, that would make
                                1,000 companies in the State. The ordinary expenses of independent
                                military companies 4s $2,500; I will put the cost at $2,000. Now
                                these companies will cost their members $2,000,000; and of that sum
                                we propose to pay $70,000. Where it costs each man $20 we propose to
                                pay him seventy cents. Seventy cents would be appropriated for each
                                man under this bill. Without a stretch of imagination I should think
                                every Senator could see how seventy cents could be expended for each
                                man. The question is will those who stay at home and till the soil
                                to put money in their pockets thereby, re fuse to pay seventy cents
                                for every man for protection? Why the extra tobacco a man would use
                                while drilling would amount to that.
                            Mr. STEELE. I think the amount appropriated here is too small. If we
                                have any organization at all, the one proposed in this bill is about
                                as good a one as we can get up. It is very nearly the bill we had at
                                the last session appropriating $75,000, and then it was thought too
                                large because we had no war; and now we have a war I conceive the
                                amount is too small. I can not see how any bill could be gotten up
                                which would appropriate money more economically than this one. I do
                                not see how a less sum would be of any service whatever. Instead of
                                inserting $40,000, as proposed by the amendment, I would prefer to
                                see $100,000. The House of Representatives has the sole power, under
                                the constitution, to originate revenue bills. I regarded this as a
                                revenue bill. Their committees, both of Ways and
                                    Means and Military Affairs, have
                                carefully considered this bill. The object is not as has been said,
                                to appropriate large sums to military encampments; it is, as is
                                expressed in the sixth section, to be by the Colonel distributed
                                among the companies, to pay for military drills, of armories, courts
                                martial and music, and for the procurement of equipments and
                                munitions. I hope the amendment will not be adopted, and that the
                                bill be passed without amendment. I should like some amendments of
                                small importance passed,  but I
                                think the great importance of the passage of this bill at the
                                earliest moment admonishes me to waive any minor objections that I
                                may have, as the general features of the bill are right.
                            Mr. RAY. I think it will turn out upon slight examination that all
                                the benefits of this bill may be enjoyed with much less expense than
                                is proposed in the bill. Although it divides the people of the State
                                into active and sedentary militia, the sedentary militia are not
                                armed nor taxed. It does not undertake to stimulate men who would
                                otherwise belong to the sedentary militia by pay or by making it
                                easy for military service, but on the contrary it takes the men just
                                as they are, stimulated, encouraged, moved and inspired by patriotic
                                ardor, sir, and where that is the case we need no money to make this
                                system work admirable. I think $60,000, or $50,000, will put this
                                system into admirable operation. I think a good deal with other
                                Senators, that after we have paid the Adjutant and Quartermaster
                                General's salary, the expense of the encampments is more for show
                                than utility, i think these large brigade encampments ought to be
                                voluntary, and ought to cost the people nothing. They are generally
                                gotten up by commandants and those who would show their epauletts
                                and dress swords.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB confessed his regret to see opposition made to this
                                appropriation, and the more regret that the source from which so
                                much of the opposition comes is from the opposition itself; and that
                                too while we find the people willing to be taxed to keep up a
                                military system. He made reference to the fact that preference had
                                been even to the portions of the State subject to invasion, in all
                                the relief bills passed this session, and yet the breath of
                                opposition to this bill appeared to come from that section of the
                                State. "We are willing to give our brothers and sons the most of the
                                people of Marion county are willing to make themselves a sacrifice,
                                if need be, for the constituency of those men who are harping about
                                the appropriation of $70,000 a year.
                            Mr. FERGUSON desired to say, in reply to allusions made to him, that
                                he was not opposed to die bill; but on the other hand he had been in
                                favor of it all the time. He called attention to the fact that his
                                opposition to the six regiment bill a few days ago was based
                                principally on the ground that the militia bill superseded the
                                necessity of the six regiments; and it was preferable, because it
                                gave the Governor discretionary power to call into service just such
                                a force as was necessary, and he need not have men under pay unless
                                circumstances required it. A number of companies would organize in
                                his county under the bill, as soon as it is passed. He had voted
                                against laying the amendment on the table be cause he wanted to hear
                                some discussion on the subject. He did not know what amount might be
                                annually appropriated, but desired the appropriation to be large
                                enough to make the system effective. It had been his pleasure on all
                                occasions to speak of the liberal manner in which the people of the
                                interior and northern portions of the State desired to prepare the
                                people of the border for defense. The people on the border think
                                that they ought to be armed, and left to themselves until they
                                called for help; and should such a call be made he did not doubt but
                                that legions from the north and interior would rush to their
                                assistance.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON had not the pleasure until this morning of hearing the
                                bill discussed. The reason of his vote on the amendment was that
                                some Senators upon the floor seemed to doubt the propriety of
                                appropriating so large a sum as the bill proposes. He did not feel
                                at liberty to vote against the bill from the fact that having - just
                                returned from his constituents he knew their feeling about it, and
                                knew they desired it to pass. His private opinion would be
                                different, were he to express it. He could find a great deal of
                                fault with this bill. He voted for the twelve regiment bill, and
                                would rather vote for twenty regiments than to vote for this bill,
                                which would bring a draw back upon the agricultural interests of the
                                State worse than any man could picture. It will create a kind of
                                encampment all over the country. But he did not feel like giving his
                                opinion against the measure, because his people desired its passage;
                                and, consequently, he would have to vote for it.
                            Mr. WOLFE obtained the floor.
                            And then came the recess till two o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            On motion by Mr. FERGUSON, a resolution was adopted, inviting
                                Lieutenant Jefferson C. Davis, one of the gallant defenders of Fort
                                Sumter, now in this city, to a seat within the bar whenever he
                                desired to visit this chamber during his continuation in the
                                city.

                            
                                RE-ORGANIZATION OF THE MILITIA.
                                The Senate resumed the consideration of the militia bill, [H. R.
                                    21.]
                                Mr. WOLFE. A system of this kind should be a permanent one, and
                                    conducted upon as nearly a correct basis as we can get. If this
                                    bill should pass in any particular shape that should cause it to
                                    be repealed, it would accomplish no good to the people, and be
                                    an absolute disadvantage. We must look at the objects and see
                                    that the bill will accomplish the object's we have in view.
                                    There is fear that the people will be oppressed and overburdened
                                    whether they be patriotic or not; and the time must come
                                    necessarily when there will be an examination into the acts of
                                    this Legislature. Let us appropriate all the money that is
                                    necessary, but let us not appropriate one dollar that is not
                                    necessary. The great lack in this contest will not be the lack
                                    of men but the lack of money.
                                [A message from the Governor announced that he had approved and

                                                16.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Pending the vote -
                                Mr. MARCH said: Under ordinary circumstances I should vote to
                                    allow every officer to be elected by the men, believing in the
                                    principle of popular sovereignty - I mean genuine popular
                                    sovereignty, not the bogus article. But we have been called upon
                                    suddenly to employ an extensive military power, while there is
                                    great lack of competent persons in some localities to fill the
                                    important positions required to be filled in this bill. It is
                                    important, and of the highest importance. The efficiency of the
                                    troops depend upon the commanders. It has been said we were
                                    disgraced in Mexico, not for want of men, but for want of
                                    properly qualified officers. I think by giving'the appointment
                                    to the Governor, he will select competent men
                                The vote was then announced as above.
                                Mr. CONLEY moved to recommit with instructions to so amend the
                                    bill as to provide that if encampments are ordered, it shall be
                                    at the expense of the brigade or division so encamping.
                                On motion of Mr. MURRAY, the motion to recommit was laid on the
                                    table.
                                Mr. RAY proposed to amend by inserting after the word "be," in
                                    section 11, line 1, these words: "elected by the commissioned
                                    officers of the companies comprising each regiment," and
                                    striking out the words, "appointed by the Governor for each
                                    regiment."
                                Mr. MELLETT moved to lay this amendment on the table.
                                Mr. WOLFE. It is due to Senators upon this floor to know the fact
                                    that the Military Committee was not full when
                                    the examination of this bill was made; and that it was not
                                    carefully criticised by the committee. We examined the
                                    amendments made by the House, and acted more upon them than on
                                    the bill itself.
                                Mr. RAY. It is proper for me to say that, al though a member of
                                    the committee, I did not pass upon the bill, and was not on the
                                    committee when it was acted upon.
                                The amendment was then laid upon the table by yeas 24, nays 18 -
                                    as follows:

                                Mr. WOLFE proposed to amend by adding the following sections:
                                SECTION 102. On application of the County Commissioners of any
                                    county, on a certified copy of their order, made in term or
                                    vacation certified by the Auditor, the Governor shall cause to
                                    be sent to such county at its expense, its quota of the public
                                    arms.
                                SEC. 103. Such Board of Commissioners shall have the care of all
                                    public arms within their respective counties, and may transfer
                                    them under such regulations as they may prescribe to such
                                    companies, battalions or regiments as maybe organized under this
                                    act, on having the safe-keeping and return thereof, when
                                    demanded by the authorized agent of the Board secured by bond
                                    and approved security.
                                On motion by Mr. MELLETT, this amendment was laid on the
                                    table.
                                Mr. MARCH proposed the following additional section, which was
                                    adopted:
                                SEC. 102. The commander-in-chief shall annually, on the first day
                                    of January, report to the Treasurer of State the amount of the
                                    military fund drawn on his warrant, the amount expended, and the
                                    items of expenditure. The Colonel of each regiment shall make a
                                    like report to the county treasurer of the amount drawn on his
                                    warrant, and the captain of each company shall make a like
                                    report of the amount of the fund distributed to his company, to
                                    the county treasurer, who shall immediately make a full report
                                    thereof to the treasurer of State.
                                Mr. RAY offered the following additional section:
                                SEC. 103. Companies of Home Guards for the local protection of
                                    towns and cities in this State, may be organized under the
                                    provisions of this act, and when organized, in conformity
                                    therewith, shall be entitled to all its benefits, and subject to
                                    all the duties and liabilities of the active militia, except
                                    that members who are exempt by law from militia service, shall
                                    not be liable to be called by the Governor into active service,
                                    out of the counties in which they may reside.
                                Pending which - On motion, the Senate took a recess for an hour
                                    to witness the presentation of two stands of colors to the llth
                                    regiment, [Col. LEW. WALLACE'S Zouaves] which ceremony was to
                                    take place at the south front of the State House.
                                Long after the time was up, the PRESIDENT called the Senators
                                    present to order.
                                And then the Senate adjourned for want of a quorum to do
                                    business.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            WEDNESDAY, May 8, 1861.
                        
                        On motion by Mr. GIFFORD, the reading of the journal of yesterday was
                            dispensed with.
                        
                            TREASON AND ITS PUNISHMENT.
                            Mr. BUNDY, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                returned the treason bill [S. 5] without amendment, and with a
                                recommendation that the same do pass.
                            On motion by Mr. NEBEKER, the report was concurred in.
                            Mr. VEATCH. Whilst he approved entirely of the general scope of the
                                bill, he thought, in the present condition of certain portions of
                                the State, it was hardly expedient, and desired to  state the reason why he thought so. So
                                far as it affects himself, he was willing that the strongest
                                possible laws should be passed to prevent the shipment of
                                provisions, arms, &c., to those States. But he must say that
                                there was a peculiar condition of things on the Southern border of
                                the State, induced by the location of his people. It had been
                                intimated here that there was to be no relief granted by this
                                General Assembly in relation to stay of execution. Now our people
                                trade at Louisville, and they are indebted there; and the Kentucky
                                merchant wants his pay, and puts his claims into Court; and here it
                                was proposed to visit the man in Indiana with a penalty of $10,000,
                                and confinement in the Penitentiary, if he sell a load of corn, a
                                barrel of pork, or a bale of hay to any man in Kentucky, even to pay
                                his lawful debts, or supply his family wants; and at the same time,
                                it was proposed to let the sheriff in upon him to make collections
                                of money to satisfy claims from the South. The bill would cut off
                                all our trade; for now, if a man were to offer any thing besides
                                provisions and munitions of war, he would get nothing for it. He
                                knew that the central, eastern and northern portions of the State
                                did not want a stay law, but here we ought to respect the wants of
                                every part of the State. And if you put down in any bill a
                                restriction that will ruin us, it should at least be considered
                                maturely. It had been said, on account of their location and trade,
                                that the people of the Southern portion of the State were affected
                                with sympathy and favor towards the South. But this had been true
                                only in a few cases, wherein they had been misled by party
                                influences. But now, all such influences and feelings were wholly
                                forgotten. Was the House willing now to put upon that people so
                                severe a test of loyalty as to send the officers of the law and turn
                                them out of doors to satisfy the claims of their Southern creditors,
                                and at the same time incarcerate them in prisons, and fine them
                                $10,000 to the man, for seeking the means of paying their just
                                debts, in their ordinary channels of trade?
                            Mr. WOODHULL. Does the gentleman wish to be understood as saying that
                                there is no necessity for this bill?
                            Mr. VEATCH. I say there is a necessity for for it; but I
                                say there is a greater necessity that a relief law should be passed,
                                so as to place us in a position that when we cast our votes for this
                                measure we may be able to stand up and defend that which has cut off
                                the trade of our people.
                            Mr. WOODHULL. The gentleman will go against the bill because it
                                operates oppressively against one portion of the State?
                            Mr. VEATCH. I will do that.
                            Mr. OWENS was satisfied that some such law ought to be passed; but if
                                you put such an inhibition without some measure of relief, it would
                                be oppressive. With a relief law he would vote for it. You lay a
                                restriction upon us that we can not sell our eggs and butter.
                            Mr. CASON I do not understand this bill to apply to Kentucky. She has
                                not seceded.
                            Mr. OWENS understood it to apply as well to Kentucky.
                            Mr. BUNDY. There was nothing in the bill which gentlemen desiring to
                                protect the interests of the State ought to vote against. It passel
                                - the Senate with great unanimity. If relief laws were required, let
                                them stand upon their own merits. This was not so properly a treason
                                bill as it was a felony bill. It was to punish selling and sending
                                provisions, aid and comfort to the rebellious States. If it be right
                                to pass an act of that kind, let us pass this bill. He did not
                                regard Kentucky as a rebellious State. He did not object to the
                                southern counties exchanging their produce for Kentucky gold, but he
                                could not consent to the passage of unconstitutional stay laws and
                                execution and appraisement laws, as applicable to past debts. Our
                                friends say they are indebted to Kentucky; aye, and Kentucky is
                                indebted to you, and their laws are open to you.
                            Mr. VEATCH. The remedy is open in a legal sense, but not really.
                            Mr. BUNDY. Then they might be met equally on any ground. Relief was
                                no more needed in the Southern counties than in Kentucky. He still
                                believed Kentucky was as much indebted to us as we were to them. The
                                Kentucky banks had responded with gold to the late run upon them;
                                Kentucky currency was sound, and there would be no relief laws
                                there.
                            Mr. VEATCH objected only to that portion of the bill which cuts off
                                trade.
                            Mr. PARRETT read that portion of the bill, viz: "by furnishing such
                                enemies or persons in rebellion with arms or ammunition, or
                                provisions, or any other articles for their aid or comfort, or by
                                shipping, sending or carrying to such enemies or rebels, or their
                                agents any arms, ammunition or provisions, or other articles for
                                their aid or comfort." Was that the portion to which the gentleman
                                objected!
                            Mr. VEATCH, I do not understand that any gentleman has a right to
                                rise and demand of me an answer to any question in any other way
                                than I please to answer it. I wish to illustrate the case. Suppose a
                                man trades down the river with a boat-load of provisions, and finds
                                no sale till he gets below Cairo (if he is permitted to pass that
                                point) and gets into a region where they are in armed rebellion
                                against the Government of the United States. What will he do? Should
                                he allow them to take his provisions and confiscate them, or should
                                you not allow him to take the gold for them to pay his honest debts?
                                I ask if you are not putting the patriotism of that man to a hard
                                test, when you refuse to him the right to sell, and refuse also to
                                tell him here by the passage of a stay law, that there is no
                                pressing necessity for him to go into market with his provisions -
                                that no execution shall hang over his property at home. In just such
                                a case as that, under this bill, the individual, when he should
                                return home, would be prosecuted and sent to the penitentiary for
                                selling what he had to sell, and getting the gold for it where he
                                could find a market, at a time when his home and all his means for
                                the support of his family will be sacrificed, if he did not. I ask
                                you, sir, if that would not be putting such a man to a pretty hard
                                test. He insisted that the people of the State were entitled to
                                protection, and should receive encouragement at the hands of the
                                Legislature. One word with reference to the credit of the State. It
                                had been said that we were going into the  market with our State bonds and it
                                would not do to touch the credit of the State. He would like to know
                                how a stay law could affect the credit of the State? You don't pay
                                your State's bonds under execution. You pay them by a levy of tax. I
                                tell you, it's a humbug. There is no soundness in the proposition
                                that the credit of the State will be lessened by reason of granting
                                relief by way of the stay of the execution. Upon the subject of
                                State bonds you are not proposing any relief. The great State of
                                Pennsylvania has proposed, through her Governor, to grant this same
                                kind of relief to her citizens; and I have been just informed by a
                                gentleman, that the Legislature of Kentucky has interfered with the
                                courts of that State by suspending their action upon judgments.
                            A VOICE. That's so.
                            Mr. VEATCH. These Kentucky courts are not suspended by mob force, but
                                by legislative action; but we were to be tied down by this bill,
                                deprived of all our trade, exposed to executions on all sides, and
                                hemmed in as by a fire in front and in rear. If a man trades with an
                                agent from Kentucky by this bill, he will be compelled to inquire
                                where he is from, and if information come to his ears in any way,
                                that he is going South, if he sells, he makes himself a criminal by
                                it.
                            Mr. BUNDY. Why did not the gentleman move to strike out the
                                objectionable provision when the bill was before the House
                                yesterday, on the second reading?
                            Mr. VEATCH. Because I was not aware that it was going to be sprung
                                upon the House so soon. All I ask now is, that the consideration of
                                this bill be suspended till we can ask the House whether the are
                                willing to grant relief to debtors; and then members can take such
                                ground as they see fit, and be enabled to defend their position when
                                they shall return home.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN (Mr. Lane in the chair.] He should vote for the
                                bill, if he could get no better measure. But, like the gentleman
                                from Spencer, he expected and desired some measure of relief from
                                the commercial pressure that would be upon us. The central and
                                eastern portion of the State were not effected as the southern
                                portion. He asked gentlemen from the central and eastern portions of
                                the State if the southern portion should now be sacrificed? Those
                                people were just as loyal as any, but loyalty was often affected by
                                pecuniary pressure. The courts of Kentucky had been closed as to
                                foreign as well as home indebtedness. Should we hold our courts open
                                to Kentucky creditors while their courts were closed to us? Such a
                                policy was suicidal. In Pennsylvania and Ohio, relief measures for
                                all the people had been recommended and were pending before their
                                Legislature. The gentleman fro in Henry had said the people of the
                                southern portion had been amply provided for. Five thousand stand of
                                arms promised! God save us from such provision! Five thousand arms
                                to be distributed among thirteen counties. These men were the ones
                                that must first peril their lives in the event of invasion. This was
                                not any more a provision for the protection of the southern portion,
                                than for the protection of the entire State. The county of
                                Vanderburgh alone had voted $30,000 for defense, and all the people
                                there were preparing nobly. The southern portion of the State had
                                been for the last ten years treated as a step child. If the
                                gentleman from Henry's constructions of the bill were correct, the
                                bill was not worth a straw. If it was not to prohibit the sale of
                                produce to Kentucky, it was not worth a hill of beans. Why, we were
                                informed that there had been shipments of provisions from New Albany
                                to Louisville within the last ten days sufficient to supply the
                                Southern army for the next sixty days. He wanted no child's play in
                                this matter. He wanted no more of this sort of aid to the
                                Confederates. He did not want to discuss the propriety of relief
                                laws. He suggested that a relief law could be made without violation
                                of the constitution. The General Assembly had entire control of the
                                execution laws of the State. The Legislature might wipe out the
                                entire chapter of execution laws, and enact any constitutional laws
                                in their place. We were told by the gentleman from Henry that we
                                need not prohibit the sale of produce to Kentucky, till she shall go
                                out. Mr. A. showed how the people of Rockport had been recently
                                deprived of a consignment of powder at Owensboro. Hundreds had gone
                                from Kentucky to the Southern army, and the State was to-day but a
                                recruiting ground for the Southern rebel army. The way Kentucky was
                                raising troops for the General Government was a deception. It was by
                                individual enterprise, not by the State, and companies principally
                                of recruits from the city of Cincinnati.
                            Mr. BUNDY was not tenacious about the bill, believing it was the duty
                                of the General Government to take care of the matters mentioned in
                                it.
                            Mr. GRESHAM interposed to state his information, that last Monday the
                                Collector of the port at New Albany had been notified by the
                                Secretary of the Treasury of the United States not to permit the
                                shipment of any more provisions to the States of the
                                Confederation.
                            Mr. BUNDY was glad of that, but still he did not understand that
                                Kentucky was to be regarded as in rebellion. He liked the bill, but
                                he would try and get along, if the bill should not pass. The
                                gentleman from Knox had said that the southern country had received
                                a step-mother's treatment. He regarded all the counties of the State
                                on an equal footing in all respects. He recognized no distinctions
                                as between sections here. But the southern counties seemed bold to
                                demand what would not certainly redound to the great commercial
                                interests of the State. It was said that they want relief laws.
                                While he regretted that assumed necessity, he was obliged to regard
                                the known interests of the State at large in preference to the
                                perhaps mistaken views of necessity in the southern portion. He
                                repeated, that the General Assembly could not pass relief laws to
                                affect past contracts. This was generally conceded. He referred to
                                authority in Perkins' Digest, page 271, and the decisions there
                                recited. Our action here then could afford no relief; for Kentucky
                                would sue in the Federal Courts. He was obliged to regard the other
                                proposition of the gentle man from Knoxto wipe out all execution
                                laws as revolutionary in character; and as such it would be declared
                                void by the Courts, and ought to be.
                            Mr. CASON protested against connecting two  or three bills together and
                                log-rolling to pass or reject anything. This bill was just as broad
                                and just as restrictive as it could be. We shall not have trade with
                                provinces and persons in rebellion. Who could object to that? Then
                                if Kentucky was in rebellion, you could not sell there; otherwise
                                you could sell there as well as in the State of Ohio. That would be
                                a question for the jury. A man could not be convicted of felony
                                without the criminal intention was in evidence. He admitted the
                                Southern counties were hi a peculiar position, but the argument
                                comes to this: that they shall sell their provision to feed the
                                armies of our government, that are to shoot us down from the
                                opposite bank of the river. He was tired of this cry of sectionalism
                                in Indiana from the Southern counties. To-day they had a larger
                                number of Representatives in proportion to population than any other
                                part of the State. If the bill was right, pass it. If not, send in
                                and provision the rebellious enemies of the Government. His county
                                demanded no relief law. If the interests of the State demanded such
                                a measure he should vote for it.
                            Mr. McLEAN desired to ask the gentleman, as long as Kentucky does not
                                secede, could there be a conviction under this bill for selling
                                produce to Kentuckians?
                            Mr. CASON. The bill provided the penalty, if you sell to persons in
                                rebellion. This was a question for the jury. While Kentucky was in
                                the Union, it was as lawful to sell to Kentucky as to Ohio. The
                                whole border would rise up against a bill inhibiting the sale of
                                produce in the State of Kentucky.
                            Mr. VEATCH. I would vastly prefer such a law to this bill; and I
                                could vote for such a law.
                            Mr. CASON. Then the gentleman would vote for a law that he must know
                                would be unconstitutional.
                            Mr. TURNER, to test the sense of the House, desired, as soon as it
                                might be in order, to offer a resolution to the effect, That the
                                bill be recommitted to the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary, with instructions to amend so as to
                                prohibit the sale of contraband goods to the States that have
                                refused to respond to the President's call for troops.
                            Mr. PARRETT said Mr. Cason had read his speech. The modification of
                                the bill, as proposed by the resolution, would not make it more
                                acceptable. ["Yes it would."] He hoped the bill, as it stands, would
                                receive the proper consideration. This bill had passed the Senate,
                                and it had been reported by our committee without amendment. Was not
                                the bill right? He deprecated side issues, as attempts to dodge and
                                procure the rejection of what may be right. He gave examples of the
                                effect of inducing a verdict from considerations outside of the
                                record. If the bill was right, it was said we ought to have a relief
                                law! It was like the argument of the juror: "If he didn't murder
                                that man, then he stole my horse." He was weary of
                                hearing flings at the north and center by members from the Pocket
                                district. If they were afraid to fight, let them step back a row of
                                stumps and see if we will not fight with them and for them. There
                                was but one member from the north that bolted on the six regiment
                                bill, and that was himself. He understood these speeches from border
                                gentlemen to be to the effect that we refused to aid them while they
                                have to fight battles on fields of danger where we are afraid to
                                appear. Such was the expression here against as brave hearts and as
                                strong arms and as ready for patriotic action as any people on
                                earth.
                            Mr. HOPKINS spoke for the southern counties, that the people there
                                cherished no such thing as the gentleman had indicated. They looked
                                upon the whole people of the State as a unit on this question.
                            Mr. PARRETT continued. The objection to this bill was to the only
                                vital part in in the clause that prohibits aiding the rebel forces
                                "by shipping, sending or carrying provision," to them or their
                                agents. Did gentlemen want to feed ant fatten these men so that they
                                can shoot and fight well? Here in Indianapolis, we were told by
                                resolutions yesterday, that there was a determination by the people
                                to stop this; and it was a well known fact that the people of
                                Lafayette were constrained patriotically to interfere and preven
                                shipments of provisions southward.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS objected to indiscriminate references to Representatives
                                from the border as opposed to this bill.
                            Mr. ROBERTS. There is no foundation for them whatever.
                            Mr. PARRETT desired to place no man in false position. He must, of
                                course, for himself act for the defense of the integrity, the honor
                                and the brave and unflinching patriotism of the people of Northern
                                Indiana. To secure everything for the defense of the State and give
                                a preference to the southern counties, he would go as far as any
                                man; and as he was advised at present, this bill was just the thing
                                the State wants.
                            Mr. EDSON had protested from the start that the people of the border
                                counties were not correctly represented here by the expression of
                                any sentiment of distrust against the patriotism, the liberality or
                                the bravery of the men of other portions of the State. As to the
                                preference in the distribution of arms, he was apprehensive that
                                they would not be procured as soon as they would be needed. He was
                                in favor of every provision of this bill. He knew it would work
                                great hardships in the border. But they were Union men; and he
                                repelled the flouts that their loyalty was not to be trusted. He
                                referred to the remark of the gentleman from Randolph on the six
                                regiment bill.
                            Mr. PROSSER had said no more reflecting against the Southern portion
                                than the Northern portion. He said the bill ought to provide for
                                difficulties, let them exist where they may. I was against the
                                preference it gives to the first four Congressional districts.
                            Mr. EDSON must be excused for his warmth, because but yesterday he
                                was informed that the agent to procure arms would not have them
                                ready here for four or five weeks to come, and he had but this
                                morning heard a Senator insinuate that arms for this border might go
                                over the river through secession proclivities there. He was properly
                                indignant at the gratuitous intimation.
                            Mr. PACKARD thought if we undertake here to regulate commerce between
                                the States, we ought first to abolish the Congress of the United
                                States. He thought the bill ought to be referred  to the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary, to be properly guarded against any
                                unconstitutional provision.
                            Mr. PROSSER replied to Mr. Parrett. He told the gentleman frankly
                                that he wanted to coerce no man's vote for a stay law. The passage
                                of this bill would be ruinous to the Southern part of the State. He
                                would not say the bill was not right; but then he claimed protection
                                from ruin as far as legislation by relief laws could confer
                                protection. The people in the southern counties would have to meet
                                the shock, and suffer in their persons and in the destruction of
                                their flocks and fields. He hoped to hear nothing more about
                                elections and sectionalism in this State.
                            Mr. WOODHULL believed gentlemen all admitted the necessity of the
                                measure. The gentleman from Spencer had declared but a few days ago,
                                that he would prohibit the supply of provisions to the enemy, if it
                                brought starvation and suffering of women and children; that
                                starvation to be preferred to some of the horrors of war. He saw no
                                necessity for sending the bill back for amendments indicated. He
                                also contended that the bill had no connection whatever with the
                                passage of stay laws. What was the precise objection of the
                                gentleman from Spencer to this bill?
                            Mr. VEATCH. That you compel the citizen, at his peril, to know to
                                what class of persons he is selling his provisions. All parts of the
                                State of Kentucky might be regarded as depots for the supplying of
                                the Southern army. The bill will interrupt the business of innocent
                                persons, and will not effect the object proposed. I would much
                                prefer a bill declaring that you shall not sell at any point in
                                Kentucky.
                            Mr. WOODHULL. There was a necessity for doing something in this
                                direction. Did not the gentleman from Knox say that the
                                representatives from the North had conceded arms to the South to
                                keep themselves out of the conflict?
                            The SPEAKER. If the gentleman from Steuben can torture the language
                                of the gentleman from Knox into such meaning, there will be no
                                discussion between us.
                            When Mr. Woodhull had concluded -
                            Mr. SHERMAN. Gentlemen should not take sectional views here. He was a
                                citizen of Indiana citizen of a loyal State, ready to sustain the
                                Government and the stars and stripes on every field. If this bill,
                                or any other bill of the session, was to act oppressively to the
                                tax-payer, he regretted it. But he was proud of the response of the
                                people of his State with men and means for the support of the
                                Government. It evinced that we were not yet degenerate sons of a
                                noble ancestry. He referred to the former wars of the country, which
                                produced but comparatively little excitement, and contrasted those
                                times with the present. Then proclamation after proclamation were
                                necessary to call our men into the field. Now but a single call from
                                Washington had been responded to by twice, even thrice the number
                                required. All party predilections and party feelings were now merged
                                in a paramount and absorbing feeling of patriotism. Our only
                                difficulty was as to the best mode and the most efficient manner of
                                rendering our share of the support of the cause of our country, and
                                the supply of her every need. Blessing and honor await the patriot
                                that does the most. Let us make this war instant and terrible. Let
                                us carry the war into Africa.
                            Mr. JENKINSON. I object. Africa is not in the bill. The gentlemen is
                                out of order.[Laughter.]
                            Mr. SHERMAN continued. Let this war go on vigorously. Let us teach
                                the Southern Alliance that while a star remains in the field of the
                                flag of our country, there will be found enough brave hearts and
                                strong arms to defend it; and wo to the traitorous hand
                                that would strike the individual that seeks protection under its
                                folds.
                            Mr. FISHER. I have been exceedingly interested in this debate. We
                                have had eloquent speeches on almost every conceivable subject
                                except that under consideration. [Laughter.] But, sir, there has
                                scarce been a word said in i elation to the bill; its provisions, or
                                its propriety or impropriety. Nor do I myself propose to discuss it
                                now. I propose to move that the bill be recommitted, with
                                instructions to strike out all from the enacting clause, and report
                                Senate bill No. 5 in its place. I think if gentlemen will compare
                                the two Senate bills, 4 and 5, they will certainly come to the
                                conclusion that the latter is preferable. I regard the bill under
                                consideration as being of no manner of use. I look upon it as chips
                                and porridge - doing neither good nor harm. All I want is an
                                efficient bill. If gentlemen desire to pass a bill that will be
                                inoperative - merely a paper lawlet them pass the bill as it is now
                                before us.
                            Mr. GRESHAM asked for an explanation of Senate bill No. 5.
                            Mr. FISHER sent up a copy of it which was read by the Clerk.
                            I apprehend that that bill provides all that is needed.
                                There is no probability that any person would be punished under this
                                bill unless he knowingly violated its provisions. For that reason I
                                think it possesses a decided advantage over the bill before the
                                House. Hence I move the commitment with instructions.
                            Mr. CRAIN. That bill suits my notion exactly; but I have no doubt
                                that the course proposed by the gentleman from Wabash will induce
                                delay, because both have been fully discussed in the "House of
                                Lords," and the bill now before the House has been deliberately
                                preferred by them. Knowing this, I think it might be nothing but
                                delaying time to pass the other bill here. We might pass it, and
                                have a committee of conferference, and not get it
                                at last.
                            Mr. FISHER. There might be something gained by a committee
                                    of conference.
                            Mr. GRAIN. There might be some improvements made in that way; but
                                still the bill before us nearly meets the case. There might be some
                                amendments. I am not prepared to say that no produce shall be
                                shipped to Louisville.
                            A VOICE. It does not go that far.
                            Mr. CRAIN. Well, if it does not, then I am free to say that this
                                recommitment would result in nothing but mere delay. I think we have
                                a necessity for the passage of this bill. I think we ought to
                                prohibit the shipping of provisions to the seceded States. As to the
                                constitutional question, that does not enter into my brain at all.
                                     I do not care anything
                                about that. I guess we shall be able to accomplish all we want by it
                                before any Supreme Court can get together and decide upon its
                                constitutionality. I believe we have the power, whenever the people
                                of the State of Indiana think we ought to do it, to prevent the
                                shipping of produce to the rebel States. I think we ought to pass
                                such a bill, and show our hands at once. As for talking here about
                                North and South, that should never enter into the question. I have
                                heard enough of that, long ago - and if we would avoid all such
                                allusion we would get along with much less feeling. I hope we will
                                confine ourselves strictly to the question before the House. I live
                                in the central portion of the State and am a Kentuckian, because of
                                that I ought to take the contract on myself to do all the fighting.
                                I think, sir, that we are all alike brave. Every man of us - every
                                man in the State will fight when there is occasion - one portion of
                                the State as well another.
                            Mr. ROBBINS. There is one thing we ought to know before we take
                                action on this matter, and that is, whether or not we are going to
                                have a recess and go home. If we are going to have a recess I think
                                that this matter ought to be deferred till we see what the slave
                                States on the border are going to do. If I were satisfied that they
                                were going out, I would vote for this bill at once. But if we pass
                                it now it might weaken the hands of the Union party in Kentucky. And
                                if we are going to stay here and finish the business of the session,
                                I am still for passing this bill; but if we adjourn for a recess, I
                                would delay action till we return. If we are to pass the bill now I
                                am in favor of the motion of the gentleman from Wabash. I prefer the
                                bill he proposes as a substitute for the bill before us. The bill
                                before us compels every man who sells produce on the border to know
                                every man he trades with, whether he is loyal or disloyal; whilst
                                the substitute says, the person who shall knowingly violate the law
                                shall suffer.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG interrupting. The gentleman from Fulton is mistaken
                                altogether as to the bill before the House. The word "knowingly" is
                                introduced there, and has reference to every part of it goes through
                                the whole bill.
                            Mr. ROBBINS continued. He supposed then, under the provisions of this
                                bill, we could sell to Kentucky. He rather thought it would be well
                                for the Legislature to have a recess. If we pass such a bill as this
                                now, contraband laws might have a bad effect on the border slave
                                States. He considered also that the southern counties were about as
                                convenient to the eastern markets as we in the north part of the
                                State, and in the meanwhile they could get off their surplus in that
                                direction. He would postpone the bill certainly, if we are to have a
                                recess of the session.
                            Mr. GRESHAM could not see any substantial difference between these
                                bills. That proposed by the gentleman from Wabash was perhaps a
                                little more complete in the details. It was substantially the same.
                                If the bill proposed as a substitute was before the House, and
                                advanced as far as the other, he would rote for it. He wished really
                                to gain time.
                            The SPEAKER interrupting The recollection of the Chair is that
                                    that bill is now on the third reading in the
                                House.
                            Mr. GRESHAM. But if we pass it I under, stand it is in a condition
                                that it has to go again to the Senate. But this bill may be passed
                                and go now at once to the Governor. I am ready to vote for this
                                bill. I can not say that I am willing to assist the General
                                Government. These rebels have attacked the Government; they have
                                inaugurated war, and I think it is perfectly right to make them feel
                                the consequences. But the General Government has already taken this
                                in hand. The work of this bill is already done. Its only operation
                                is to prevent provisions going out of the State of Indiana into
                                Southern ports; and now, under the order of Mr. Secretary Chase, we
                                will not be permitted to send provisions South. It has been assumed
                                here, Mr. Speaker, that the southern portion of the State wants a
                                relief law. I represent a southern county, and I give notice now
                                that when the relief bill comes up I will vote against it, for the
                                reason that my constituents do not want anything of the kind. If we
                                pass a relief bill it will have a bad effect without. The South will
                                say, see there what one of the most wealthy States of the North have
                                done; they have passed a relief bill. And it will encourage the
                                rebels. And I think it will also have a bad effect on our own
                                people. It smacks too much of repudiation. It will have a
                                demoralizing effect upon the country. I have just spent some two or
                                three days with my constituents, and they have, nineteen out of
                                every twenty of them, advised me to have nothing to do with this
                                proposition. A few have desired it, but they are generally men who
                                would like to pay their debts in that way under any circumstances.
                                Perhaps some few counties have really a necessity for a relief law;
                                but that affords no reason why we should proclaim to the world that
                                our people all over the State are in the same straitened condition.
                                A relief law is the first step towards State repudiation. To save
                                time, Mr. Speaker, I will now move to lay the motion to recommit on
                                the table.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. TURNER now submitted his motion to recommit with instructions to
                                report a bill prohibiting the sale of contraband goods in such
                                States as have refused to respond to the call of the President for
                                troops.
                            On motion by Mr. BUNDY, it was laid on the table.
                            The House then took a recess till 2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The House resumed the consideration of the treason-felony bill, [S.
                                5.]
                            Mr. DOBBINS was obliged to offer a word of defense for the people he
                                represents. He had seduously avoided all sections considerations in
                                this crisis. But the people in the southern counties had not been
                                treated equally. But yesterday the captains of two companies from
                                his county had left here in disgust, because they could not get
                                satisfaction with reference to the acceptance of their companies.
                                There was a pressing need to be ready in his county for the
                                marauding attempts of old Mat. Vandever, which were expected as soon
                                as our soil might be invaded, and our people engaged in war. His
                                people wanted arms,  and when he
                                called for them at the proper department he was told they were not
                                ready. Such was the measure of protection extended to us, and he
                                referred to the distrust of the loyality of the people of the
                                southern counties by the gentleman from Randolph, who was afraid to
                                trust them with arms. That gentleman's explanation made it but
                                little better. Now with regard to this bill, he did not believe we
                                have the power here to regulate commerce between the States. One
                                gentleman had said he did not care whether the bill was
                                constitutional or not.
                            Mr. CASON. It was to prohibit the selling to persons, not States, in
                                rebellion. He had stated distinctly that he believed we have the
                                power to pass this bill.
                            Mr. DOBBINS. He had come to the conclusion, however, to support the
                                bill. The organization of Vigilance Committees
                                evinced the necessity of such a law as this. The public sentiment
                                required it. The bill was stringent enough. The amendment proposed
                                to the bill by the gentleman from Wabash was too stringent. It never
                                could be executed.
                            Mr. HAWORTH demanded the previous question, and under its operation
                                the vote on the passage of the bill was reported - yeas 68, nays 5 -

                            Mr. FORD, pro forma. I agree with every sentiment
                                of that bill, still I do not believe it the province of this
                                Legislature to pass it. I have confidence in the National Republican
                                Administration, that it will attend to these things for us.
                            So the bill passed the House of Representatives, the title - A bill
                                to define certain felonies, and to provide for the punishment of
                                persons guilty thereof.

                            6.
                        On motion by Mr. CLAYPOOL, this motion was laid on the table.
                        
                            REORGANIZATION OF THE MILITIA.
                            The PRESIDENT announced the order to be the consideration of the
                                unfinished business of yesterday - the militia bill, H. R. 21 - the
                                question being on the amendment (Mr. Ray's) pending at the

                                years."
                            Mr. LINE made an ineffectual motion to amend section 14, by striking
                                from word "ballot" these words: "and no primary election shall be
                                valid unless by two thirds of the company vote."
                            Mr. RAY offered the following amendment, which was adopted:
                            "Amend by adding after the last section provided that nothing in this
                                act shall be so construed as to repeal or modify any provision of an
                                act passed at the present session of the General Assembly, entitled
                                "an act to provide for the employment of six regiments of volunteers
                                for the protection of the property and citizens of the State, and
                                making provision for the organization - and equipment of the same,
                                and fixing the compensation of the officers and men composing said
                                force, and procuring arms therefore," and proved by the Governor May
                                , 1861.'"
                            On motion by Mr. LINE and by unanimous consent, section 17 was
                                stricken out, to-wit: "SEC. 17. It shall be the duty of the Captain,
                                after election, to appoint the Sergeants and Corporals of his
                                company, and a company clerk, he may also reduce such Sergeants and
                                Corporals to the rank at his discretion."
                            On motion by Mr. MELLETT, the bill was considered as engrossed and
                                read the third time.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON made an ineffectual motion to amend the 33d section by
                                striking out the words "or anticipated."
                            Mr. WILLIAMS made an ineffectual motion to amend section 47, by
                                striking out the words "or magistrate."
                            On motion of Mr. FERGUSON and by unanimous consent, the following
                                words were added to section ninety-seven: "Provided that nothing
                                contained in this act shall be construed as to prohibit the Governor
                                from making distribution of arms to incorporate towns and cities
                                according to the provisions of an act passed at the present session
                                of this General Assembly."
                            Mr. LINE made an ineffectual motion to amend section fifty by
                                inserting after the word "officer," the words "private or
                                privates."
                            The bill was then finally passed by yeas 35, nays 7.
                            Mr. LINE, when his name was called, said there are one or two
                                provisions I would like to see in this bill. One is giving
                                commissioned officers powers to elect their commanders. I vote for
                                the bill with some reluctance.
                            The PRESIDENT. Hereafter explanations will not be allowed after the
                                roll-call has commenced.
                            On motion by Mr. RAY the title of the bill was amended by
                                appropriately inserting these words "and saving this act from the
                                operation of certain laws therein mentioned."
                        
                        
                            ADJOURNMENT TO A DAY CERTAIN.

                            THE STATE UNIVERSITY - ITS CABINET.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON. I ask leave to make a statement to the Senate. I hold
                                in my hand a bill that was duly enrolled, and which has been signed
                                by a portion of the officers whose signatures are necessary, but
                                which failed to become a law because of the neglect of some of the
                                signatures, and never having been filed in the Secretary of State's
                                office. It relates to the Indiana University. The faculty are about
                                to print this year's catalogue, and they desire if this bill be a
                                law to insert therein the name of the State officer who is by this
                                bill made a member of the faculty. I therefore ask the privilege of
                                the Legislature to introduce this bill, and ask that the rules may
                                be suspended in order to pass it again, as that is the only way we
                                can get at it. It was printed by Mr. Secretary Tyner in his titles
                                of bills, as a law passed. As it is a bill that everybody in the
                                Senate, I believe, voted for, I would like to run it through both
                                Houses, that it may take effect immediately.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS. I think that bill is in violation of the standing rule
                                of the Senate.
                            Mr. MILLER. It is a casual omission.
                            Mr TARKINGTON. Not only casual, but absolute. - The motion to suspend
                                the rules was agreed to, and the bill [S. No. 19,] entitled "An act to
                                authorize the trustees of the State University to appropriate a
                                certain amount of the University funds for the enlargement of its
                                cabinet and library, and directing the State Librarian to trans fer
                                certain documents herein named to the library of the State
                                University; also making the State Geologist a member of the faculty
                                of the University, and requiring him to deposit specimens in
                                minerology and geology in the cabinet of the same," was read the
                                first and second times by title only.
                            On the further motion of Mr. TARKINGTON the bill was considered as
                                engrossed, read the third time and finally passed the Senate by yeas
                                39, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            THE TWO MILLION LOAN BILL.
                            The PRESIDENT directed the Secretary to take from the table the loan
                                bill, H. R. 22, with the Committee report embracing amendments
                                thereto, submitted last Saturday; and stated the question to be on
                                concurring in the said report.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB. I think it would be wise to leave the bill at two
                                million. I am not prepared to say that a million and a half will be
                                enough. I have seen no estimate stating how much we will need before
                                the Legislature meets again.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS. The Governor must have made an estimate before he
                                recommended to us an appropriation of one million. I am not willing
                                to go for an appropriation of more than one million and a half.
                            Mr. President CRAVENS. [Mr. Tarkington in the Chair.] I have voted
                                for the most extensive and enlarged means of defense, and I am
                                willing to vote whatever amount of money is necessary to carry them
                                out. In what I am going to say I will be compelled to notice two
                                propositions now before the Senate. One of them is the House bill
                                now under consideration proposing to negotiate a loan of two
                                millions. A proposition of the committee is to cut this sum down to
                                one and a half million. That is with a view to the bill of the
                                Senator of Fayette [Mr. Claypool's 17] to issue half a million of
                                treasury notes. Those two provisions will necessarily be considered
                                as constituting one whole. So far as the treasury note proposition
                                is concerned, I was at first disposed to be in favor of it, but I
                                think now it is not a practicable one, for it would interfere with
                                the revenue of the State. I am disposed and anxious to keep the
                                expenditures entirely separate, and let the State revenue remain as
                                it is These treasury notes are redeemable for taxes and must
                                necessarily be paid out again by the State; and those who remember
                                the history of treasury notes and scrip in this State will not go
                                into a measure of this sort. They are not redeemable in specie nor
                                anything; they are not convertible at the pleasure of the holder,
                                and the consequence will be when they have been paid by the
                                treasurer, upon appropriations or claims, that they will go into the
                                hands of the people and they must be depreciated in the market.
                                Another reason why I would not favor such a proposition is this: We
                                propose to throw into the market a million and a half or two million
                                of bonds, and with the revenue of the State interfered with as it
                                would be by these notes, I apprehend there would be encountered at
                                once a serious difficulty in negotiating these bonds. For that
                                reason I would prefer that we have a uniform system; let our revenue
                                and taxes remain as they are as far as it is practicable, and impose
                                no greater burdens than are absolutely necessary, l am aware it is a
                                good time to test the disposition of the people to encounter an
                                onerous taxation. But I am in favor of bringing back this bill to
                                the original amount of two millions, and let these bonds be
                                negotiated ag necessity will require. This bill proposes an
                                additional tax of five cents, and another bill for the  purpose of gradually absorbing these
                                treasury notes, which also proposes an additional tax of five cents.
                                One-fourth of that amount is all that would be required in my
                                judgment. We have levied a tax of fifteen cents for State purposes;
                                let that remain. We have also levied a tax of two and a half cents
                                upon every one hundred dollars worth of property for the purpose of
                                a State debt sinking fund tax for the liquidation of outstanding
                                stocks. Now I propose to the Senate, and I intend to submit an
                                amendment to the report of the committee, that the two find a half
                                cent tax shall be diverted from that purpose and devoted to the
                                redemption of the bonds provided for in this bill; for it would be
                                folly to redeem five and a half per cent, stocks while we have six
                                per cent, bonds outstanding. Suppose you authorize the issue of two
                                millions of bonds at six per cent., the interest will be one hundred
                                and twenty thousand dollars. The two and a half tax already levied,
                                and the two and a half which you will levy, will be five cents, and
                                upon $450,000,000 of property will be about $225,000, leaving
                                $120,000 to pay interest, and $105,000 to create a sinking fund for
                                gradual liquidation of the debt; enough, I apprehend, to give
                                confidence to those who may purchase the bonds. With that view I am
                                opposed to the provisions of the report as made by the
                                    Committee on Finance.
                            Mr. STEELE. I concur in most of the views entertained by the
                                honorable President. This is a matter I have thought a good deal
                                about, and I have been opposed to this plan of issuing treasury
                                notes. I think the better plan is as he has suggested, to authorize
                                the sale of a sufficient number of coupon bonds. It is the only
                                feasible way I can see to do this thing; and we only want as much as
                                we want to use, and we do want that much; there is no necessity of
                                putting any more in market. There is no prospect of our getting
                                along with one million dollars, as has been suggested. The Governor
                                says we will need a million of dollars in six months; and then, in
                                the absence of the Legislature, what are we to do in the balance of
                                the time.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER. The report embraces the views of a majority of the
                                committee entertained at the time it was made. As for myself I have
                                been opposed to the treasury note system of raising money. There is
                                a provision in the bill which provides that the notes should not be
                                sold for less than par, and with that provision in it I think no
                                Senator need not be scared about it. With that provision in it the
                                bill can not injure the State, but I have my doubts whether it would
                                raise any considerable amount of money. This thing of raising money
                                is a business transaction, and does not depend upon patriotism
                                altogether. So far as the bill under consideration is concerned it
                                strikes me that it would not be policy to authorize the sale of more
                                bonds than is absolutely necessary to keep up the finances of the
                                State, for this reason: If it is known by capitalists that the State
                                has authorized the sale of a large amount of bonds it makes them
                                more time-rous. The more bonds you throw into market the further you
                                bring the price down. For it occurs to me on the question, as to how
                                much means are necessary, I confess I know nothing at all about it,
                                and I apprehend no Senator can tell what means are necessary; we
                                must go at it, to considerable extent, in the dark. With that view I
                                think we had better authorize the issue of one and a half million
                                only, for the bonds will sell better; and if it becomes necessary to
                                raise more money, provide hereafter for the sale of more bonds. I
                                believe it would be economy to do so, On the question of levying
                                taxes, Mr. President, so far as I am concerned and the constituency
                                [represent, we are for meeting this matter as we go along. [Mr.
                                LINE"Consent."] We want to take upon ourselves a share of the
                                responsibility and burden, and not put it upon our children and the
                                generations to come [Mr. STEELE"That is the way."] Let us meet the
                                thing squarely and fairly; we will make money by so doing.
                            On motion by Mr. WOLFE, the further consideration of this subject was
                                passed over informally.
                        
                        
                            THE TREASURY NOTE SYSTEM.
                            On motion by Mr. STUDABAKER, Senator Claypoors treasury-note bill
                                [17] was taken from the "table.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. A majority of the Committee on
                                    Finance were of the opinion that this bill would open
                                the cheapest and most expeditious way of raising $500,000. My own
                                opinion is th it way, and I have seen nothing in the arguments of
                                Senators that has turned me from my first opinion in this matter.
                                Were I to test the strength of the two million loan bill by the test
                                applied to this it would certainly fail. Suppose we incorporate in
                                the two million loan bill the stringency gentlemen desire in this
                                bill, I would like to know where you would get pork and beans for
                                the army. I apprehend the response of every Senator would be against
                                the proposition to amend so that these bonds should not go for less
                                than their face. That very moment you would take from the government
                                the power to raise a dollar. I have simply to say, and I will stake
                                my reputation upon it, that if one and a half or two millions of
                                bonds are issued and $500,000 is issued in pursuance of the
                                provisions of this bill, there never will be a time when these
                                treasury notes will not, in the markets of Indiana, command more
                                than your six per cent. bonds. It is much easier to pull down a
                                system than to build one up; and I would be much gratified if
                                Senators instead of pulling down would endeavor to bolster up this
                                system. One argument was made against the bill that the notes were
                                not made payable in gold. Well, the argument suggested to me the
                                idea of amending the bill so that these notes, in the proportion in
                                which they are made payable on the first of January, shall be made
                                redeemable then in gold. Then I want to know if these bonds,
                                redeemable in 1861, 1862 and 1863, and bearing six per cent,
                                interest, will not command as high a price in the market as your six
                                percent bonds running twenty years - two millions of them. I am
                                occupying the position that Indiana can realize money at a cheaper
                                rate and less discount in this way than by issuing bonds. The duty
                                of Senators to the State requires them to adopt that system which
                                will procure money at the cheapest rate. I submit to Senators, with
                                all due deference to the bill reported from the other end of the
                                Capitol, whether this bill is not guarded in nine points where the
                                     other is guarded in one? I
                                am satisfied that the majority "of this Senate is against this bill.
                                When you go to the country with these treasury notes your
                                constituencies know what they are buying. I only desired to put
                                myself right before the people of Indiana, and test the strength of
                                my judgment upon this matter with the judgment of other Senators
                                upon this floor. Sir, we must have two millions - it is the smallest
                                amount we can adjourn upon. But if this bill is to go under I am
                                with the Senator from Harrison, that this one should go under before
                                the loan bill. Gentlemen seem to desire to go as far away from home
                                to borrow money as they can. If we hope to get a sale for these
                                bonds we must prepare for their redemption, as remarked by the
                                Senator from Adams. I trust, if we do not adopt this measure, we may
                                adopt one in the other bill that will keep our bonds the first State
                                bonds in the American market. I would be willing to invest every
                                cent of money I could raise in these treasury notes at the same
                                price you will have to sell your bonds for; and I apprehend they
                                could be sold for from two to five per cent, more than the six per
                                cent, bonds proposed to be issued. I would be willing to allow the
                                fate of this bill to turn upon the hypothesis that these notes
                                should not be sold within two per cent, of what your bonds may be
                                sold for. A distinguished banker of New York City, well known in
                                this State, gives it as has opinion that, this treasury-note system
                                is by far the best. * * *
                             It is unworthy the position of any Senator upon this floor to entail
                                a debt for which our children will be taxed.
                            Then came the recess till 2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            On motion by Mr. LINE, a resolution was adopted "that the Door keeper
                                of the Senate be authorized to place on the desk of each Senator
                                their proportion of the printed report of the State Prison
                                    Investigating Committee had at the last session of the
                                General Assembly.

                            
                                THE TREASURY NOTE BILL.
                                The Senate resumed the consideration of Mr. Claypool's Treasury
                                    note bill, S. No. 17, pending at the time of the recess for
                                    dinner.
                                Mr. STEELE. I look upon this bill as harmless, because I think
                                    there is no prospect of a sale of these treasury notes under the
                                    provisions of the bill. If this bill should pass, the notes
                                    would not be worth fifty cents on the dollar; they would be like
                                    continental money or the treasury notes of 1842, which sold for
                                    forty cents.
                                Mr. LANDERS. I do not consider this bill a harmless one. I have
                                    no doubt but what the State can raise money in that way. I have
                                    no doubt the bankers will take it and put it in circulation in
                                    order to buy it up again after awhile at a great shave and a
                                    heavy loss to the laboring classes. Probably in one month's time
                                    these bankers will declare that this currency is not worth more
                                    than fifty cents of the dollar. With this view I do not consider
                                    it a harmless bill; but that to issue regular bonds is far the
                                    best policy.
                                Mr. LINE. I am prepared to vote for this bill, believing it is as
                                    good a plan as any that can be adopted to raise half a million
                                    of money.
                                The question being shall the committee's report, embracing a
                                    substitute for the original bill, [a new arrangement of the
                                    matter] be concurred in? -
                                The yeas and nays were demanded by Senators Line and Steele, and
                                    being ordered and taken, resulted - yeas 16, nays 24 - as
                                    follows:

                                                and Turner - 16.

                                                Newcomb, Odell, Ray, Shoulders, Steele, Stone,
                                                White. Williams, Wilson mad Wolfe - 24.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                So the report was not concurred in.
                            
                            
                                THE LOAN BILL.
                                On motion by Mr. STUDABAKER, the Senate resumed the consideration
                                    of the two million loan bill [H R. 22], the question being on
                                    concurring in the committee's report thereon,
                                The committee's amendments were concurred in,except the one
                                    reducing the sum from $2,000,000 to $1,500,000.
                                Mr. STUDABAKER. If the committee had not recommended the bill
                                    rejected by the Senate a few minutes ago, [S. No. 17] they would
                                    have left the amount in the bill as it came from the House. We
                                    will have to place in the hands of the Executive power and
                                    discretion as to the amount of these bonds he will sell. I
                                    suppose he will act prudently and will only sell an amount that
                                    is necessary. If, however, he should act imprudently, I shall
                                    not feel myself responsible for that breach of trust. We should
                                    place in the hands of those controlling the government a
                                    sufficient amount of means to carry it on in a proper mariner. I
                                    therefore will vote against concurring in the report of the
                                    committee, for the simple reason that the Senate voted against
                                    the note bill.
                                Mr. RAY. There is another view of the case. We are in an extra
                                    session, and if we should not meet again till the regular time,
                                    we are voting upon this two million to keep up the government
                                    for a period of two years. I am free to say, I do not believe,
                                    in view of the circumstances surrounding us, that two millions
                                    is more than will be necessary for one year; and we ought not to
                                    legislate in such a way as to make it necessary for the Governor
                                    to call us back again.
                                The committee's amendment was then rejected by yeas 4, nays
                                    35.
                                Mr. MARCH offered an amendment to section second, which was
                                    adopted, adding the words: "And the Treasurer of State shall
                                    file his receipt," &c.
                                Mr. President CRAVENS [Mr. Tarkington in the Chair,] offered an
                                    amendment to section second, inserting after the word
                                    "mentioned" these words: ''The 2 1/2 per cent. tax on each $100
                                    worth of taxable property heretofore levied for the State debt
                                    sinking fund purposes is hereby appropriated," and to further
                                    amend by striking out in the third line the word "five" and
                                    inserting "two-and-a-half."
                                Mr. NEWCOMB. I have great confidence in the financial skill of
                                    the Senator from Jefferson [Mr. Cravens] yet I doubt the
                                    propriety of this amendment. I fear the result of the amendment
                                    will be to disparage the bonds which we may put in market, and
                                    capitalists will point to this us an  evidence that we are making no
                                    appropriations to pay for the old ones.
                                Mr. STUDABAKER. I hope this amendment will not prevail, for I am
                                    satisfied beyond a doubt that it will be prejudicial to the sale
                                    of our bonds. Let us meet our expenses as we go along.
                                Mr. President CRAVEN'S. I have no doubt that the people will
                                    submit to what amount of taxes is necessary; but as the
                                    Legislature has agreed to negotiate a loan of two million, the
                                    question comes up what provision will be made for a gradual
                                    liquidation of that debt. In order to obviate the necessity of
                                    imposing upon the people at this time a heavy burden of taxes, I
                                    propose that this five per cent. tax shall be applied to the
                                    payment of the principal, and the balance to be applied to the
                                    liquidation of the debt. It may be that within six months we
                                    will be called back here again to make provision for more money,
                                    and we may have to come to the proposition of the Senator from
                                    Fayette [Mr. Claypool - I have no doubt of that;] but let us put
                                    off the evil day as far as possible. The Senator from Fayette
                                    referred to a letter from a capitalist of New York city. That
                                    letter says there has been no stocks yet thrown into the market
                                    in consideration of the crisis of the times, that Indiana stands
                                    fairer than any other Western State, and if she adopts this
                                    measure, her bonds had better be in market before it is crowded
                                    with the bonds of other States.
                                Mr. MURRAY. I prefer, as a Senator, to vote a direct tax for war
                                    purposes independent of any other tax. I think it is better
                                    policy to do it at this present time, for the people expect it
                                    and are willing to pay the tax. I prefer it should be done now
                                    to putting it off to another day.
                                Mr. STUDABAKER. Before we strike this out we should bear in mind
                                    that the appropriations made at the last session exceeds what
                                    the revenue will be for the coming year. The appropriations, in
                                    addition to the expenses of this extra session, will run the
                                    State into debt unless we levy an additional tax.
                                Mr. CRAVENS. Allow me to correct the gentleman. The Legislature
                                    made a provision that the taxes derived from this two-and-a-half
                                    cent tax should be diverted as far as may be necessary to pay
                                    off the debt of 1860, and for 1861 the estimate was that the
                                    proceeds of the revenue would exceed by $50,000 all
                                    appropriations.
                                Mr. STUDABAKER. I have made no calculation myself, but I have
                                    been informed by the chairman of the committee at that time, as
                                    I have stated. For several years past we have been running into
                                    debt, and that is what I am totally opposed to. The citizens of
                                    a State loaded down with a public debt, can not enjoy that
                                    confidence that they otherwise would, if the State finances were
                                    in a better condition. Let the bill remain as it passed the
                                    House of Representatives.
                                Mr. WOLFE. I am in favor of levying a tax for the purpose of
                                    meeting this extraordinary debt. This thing of running the State
                                    into debt is bad policy, and should never be done except in
                                    cases of extraordinary emergency. I think the present time is
                                    the time to commence the work of making provision for the
                                    payment of our bands. I venture to say the people ape more able
                                    to pay now than they will be hereafter. It is but piling up the
                                    evil to a more evil day. I do not believe a public debt is a
                                    public blessing. That is not the idea. We create debts because
                                    we can not avoid them. It will certainly enhance the value of
                                    our bonds by making an adequate levy of tax to pay them. It is
                                    not honest to shuffle off our liabilities on posterity. For one,
                                    if I was not willing to meet these indebtedness by paying the
                                    taxes, I would not vote them. I would be willing to vote a tax
                                    of ten cents on the hundred dollars if necessary to keep this
                                    thing in motion. It is getting patriotism at too cheap a rate to
                                    say we can make drafts on our children twenty years to come.
                                    That kind of patriotism does not suit me. Let us pay somewhat as
                                    we go, and take upon ourselves the burdens incident upon a thing
                                    of this kind.
                                [A message from the Governor announced that he had signed and
                                    approved Senator Miller's bill, No. 5.]
                                Mr. CRAVENS. Business on our border is completely paralyzed: and
                                    if we have furnished the means for carrying on the government
                                    with a tax of two and a half cents, they will say it is much
                                    better than a tax of five cents. Let us pay the interest on our
                                    debt and our credit will remain as it now is, A No. 1. We must
                                    not break down at the first effort in this race. A two and a
                                    half cent tax will cover the emergency; then why levy a heavier
                                    one? If the necessity be shown then levy a tax of five or even
                                    ten cents.

                                Mr. LINE moved to amend by adding to section second, these words:
                                    "And it is hereby made the duty of the Governor upon the
                                    delivery of bonds to the said Commissioners to take a receipt
                                    from them stating the number and the amount of each bond issued
                                    to said Commissioners which is to be by them sold.
                                Mr. SLACK offered the following amendment to the amendment: "Add
                                    this provision to the second section - Provided that the said
                                    Commissioners shall execute to the State of Indiana a bond in

                                After considerable debate thereon -
                                Mr LINE withdrew his amendment.
                                On motion by Mr. HAMILTON - yeas 29, & nays 13, - the
                                    amendment to the amendment was laid on the table.
                                
                                Mr. SLACK offered an amendment, adding to section 2 the same

                                    bond of the Commissioners was put at one million of dollars.
                                Mr. CARNAHAN moved to amend the amendment by striking out "one
                                    million" and inserting "six hundred thousand dollars."
                                On motion by Mr. SLACK, the amendment to the amendment was laid

                                    amount of the Commissioners bond was put at $100,000 each.
                                Mr. MELLETT proposed to amend the substitute by making the bond
                                    $200,000 each.

                                    any person as Agent of State and any place in the City of New
                                    York as the office of the agency under the provisions of this
                                    act."
                                Mr. CONNER moved to reconsider the vote by which the amendment
                                    (Mr. Ray's) to the substitute had been adopted.
                                And then the Senate adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            THURSDAY, May 9, 1861.
                        
                        The House met at 0 o'clock, A. M.
                        On motion of Mr. ROBERTS, the reading of the journal of yesterday was
                            dispensed with.
                        On motion of Mr. FISHER, the members of the committee on Ways
                                and Means had leave of absence for committee session.
                        Mr. ORR, Presented the Proceedings, preamble and resolutions of a meeting
                            at Selma, last Saturday, of a portion of the citizens of Delaware
                            county; and they were read by the Clerk.
                        Mr. O. moved that the resolutions be spread on the journal of the House.
                            ["No." No."] He said: It is very manifest and plain what prompted the
                            offering and the adoption of those solutions, by a portion of the
                            citizens of Delaware county, convened at Selma, on last Saturday;
                            knowing, as they did, that the traitors and tories of the South have
                            armed themselves in hostile array against the General Government,
                            endeavoring to overthrow and destroy one of the best governments ever
                            instituted by man, perpetrating outrages unheard of, upon our citizens,
                            inviting pirates of all climes to destroy our commerce, besieging our
                            forts, built for their own protection, and making our flag trail the
                            dust at Fort Sumpter, a flag sir, that commands the respect of all the
                            nations of the earth. He that claims protection under its folds, in any
                            part of the world, is safe. But go into the Southern portion of our own
                            country, and it can not afford any protection to an American citizen
                            there hence, sir, those outrages committed on our citizens and against
                            our Government, hath brought forth those resolutions, expressive of
                            their fidelity to liberty and to liberty's laws, our country and our
                            country's cause. For this reason, and out of respect for the
                            resolutions, I have desired that they should be spread on the journal;
                            but as I have heard dissenting voices, I move to lay the paper on the
                            table.
                        The motion was agreed to.
                        
                            ADJOURNMENT TO A DAY CERTAIN.
                            Mr. DOBBINS submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved by the House, (the Senate
                                                concurring), That the General Assembly will
                                            adjourn on to-morrow, at 12 o'clock M., to meet again on
                                            the 28th of this month.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. NEBEKER proposed the "21st."
                            Mr. BOBBINS. Mr. Speaker, I see a disposition on the part of members
                                to wait and see what the border States are going to do, and also to
                                ascertain the feeling of the people with respect to a relief law. I
                                think we can not do our duty without that. So far as I am concerned,
                                I could not vote for a relief law without consulting my
                                constituents. I accept the amendment for the recess to the 21st.
                            Mr. FISHER proposed to amend by striking out "12 o'clock M.,"
                                thinking it probable that we will not be able to get through by that
                                hour. There were several very important bills in the Senate that
                                must be passed before we can adjourn.
                            Mr. WOODHULL proposed to insert after "to morrow" the words "the
                                10th."
                            Mr. DOBBINS accepted the modification.
                            Mr. NEBEKER suggested an amendment to strike out members' per diem
                                during the recess.
                            The SPEAKER (Mr. Edson in the Chair). The Chair understands that the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary reported yesterday
                                that the House had no control over that matter.
                            Mr. BUNDY. If the business in the Senate was as nearly matured as the
                                business in the House, I should prefer a final adjournment to the
                                proposed recess; but I shall now acquiesce. These eleven days recess
                                - till the 21st - will leave not eleven days for a session to close
                                up.
                            Mr. PROSSER demanded the previous question, and under its force, the
                                resolution as amended was adopted - yeas 64, nays 18.
                        
                        
                            STATE NEUTRALITY.
                            Mr. POLK submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That we respect the
                                            sympathies of the border States for the reason that
                                            their institutions and inter-  ests are kindred to the
                                            Confederate States, and so far as the State of Indiana
                                            has a right, we will recognize a neutral position on
                                            their part, so long as the same is assumed and adhered
                                            to in good faith.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That neutrality on the part of
                                                Kentucky will avert the dread evils of civil war
                                                from our border, and when the resources of the
                                                contending States have been exhausted, she will
                                                become an influential pacificator in our
                                                troubles.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. BUNDY. I move to refer the resolutions to a select committee of
                                five.
                            Mr. POLK. I offer these resolutions not to elicit discussion, but to
                                ascertain the candid sentiment of the House on the subject of the
                                neutrality of the Slate of Kentucky; and I ask leave to read some
                                remarks which I have prepared in support of them. * * * *
                            Mr. Speaker: Were I to speak with an eye to the Federal Constitution
                                I would have no foundation upon which to base my remarks. But the
                                day for constitutional obligations seems to be almost passed, not
                                only in the Confederate States but in our own midst. Persons are
                                threatened with mob violence who speak sentiments in opposition to
                                the powers that be. This Legislature pass laws and usurp authority
                                which belongs alone to the Federal Government. Indeed the
                                constitution seems not to have anticipated such a state of things.
                                While we raise troops for the protection of our State from any
                                invasions of an enemy, why may we not cultivate a good friendly
                                feeling with a state which lies between our border and a hostile
                                foe, for self-protection - I mean Kentucky. Her policy will be that
                                of neutrality; taking a stand neither for nor against the Federal
                                Government. Her institutions are the same, and her social and
                                commercial relations exist to the extent, that no form of words
                                written on parchment can sever her destiny with the South. The man
                                who would believe that Kentucky can be induced to raise an army
                                against the Confederate States in this contest is devoid of that
                                warmness of heart which would make him treat a brother kind. Had we
                                better not have Kentucky our friend than our foe? What should be our
                                treatment to her in this neutral position? In my opinion it is this,
                                let Indiana pass no laws nor do anything that will in the least
                                hinder social and commercial intercourse with the people of the two
                                States; let us hide every appearance of a distrust of their
                                friendship and honor; let us keep no troops for the purposes of
                                repelling invasion by Kentuckians, as has been so often avowed; let
                                us place implicit confidence in a State which wishes to be at peace
                                with us. It would be wrong in us to cut off social intercourse with
                                what might be called a parent State. It may be asserted with safety
                                that one half of our population are either Kentuckians, or their
                                descendants. And besides, she heeded the call of her children in
                                Indiana when the Indians were overrunning them, and with brave
                                hearts and strong arms made their Monies and firesides safe. As to
                                our commercial intercourse this objection has been urged, that our
                                produce goes to feed and support our enemies in ease it passes the
                                Ohio river. This may to some extent be true, but are we to forget
                                that we get value received for what we sell? And is not money the
                                most effective material to wage a war with that can be had. It buys
                                arms, it tents and clothes the soldiers, it makes their families
                                comfortable, and it fills empty treasuries. Our rich soil and
                                industrious people raise a large surplus-more than home demand
                                requires. What must be done with it? Is it to lay on our hands and
                                decay? Are cultivated fields to run to waste? Are our people to
                                become idle and grow degenerate? and is our State to rush pell-mell
                                into bankruptcy? These questions deserve a graver consideration than
                                is given to any subject in these exciting times. Then it must be
                                remembered that there are articles produced in the South which we
                                can not well do without, such as cotton, sugar, coffee, rice,
                                &c. Will we loose any thing by keeping up a trade of exchange?
                                In these times when the bible is in every house, and the gospel is
                                preached throughout the land, is it a Christian policy to starve
                                women, children and innocent persons to accomplish a victory? Is
                                there a charitable feeling in it? Are we to act the part of
                                barbarians in this contest? I pray God that Kentucky may assert and
                                maintain a position of neutrality. There are several reasons why she
                                should do it. This war has been rushed upon us without the wish or
                                intention of the masses; both sections are guilty of bad faith. It
                                has reached that point at which one or more severe battles must be
                                fought before the people will sufficiently; awake to the dread
                                consequences of imbruing our hands in a brother's blood. Then we
                                will look for an arbiter of our troubles. May that time come soon
                                upon Kentucky, with her candid and magnanimous people, where the
                                bones of the great compromise man, Henry Clay, rest; and the home of
                                the patient and untiring peacemaker, John J. Crittenden, will all
                                eyes be turned. Drive Kentucky out of the Union and compel her to
                                take a stand against the Federal Government and the cry of PEACE,
                                    peace, will not be heard, and a continued war
                                of retaliation will end in a disgraced and ruined nation, and our
                                subjection to a military despot or a foreign monarch. Should this
                                war continue in the precipitous course with which it has started it
                                will end in a total disregard of all the rights of the seceded
                                States. It has been asserted again and again by the partying power
                                that the vested rights of a State will not be interfered with. But
                                the agravations of a war will lead us into a violation of all
                                constitutional obligations, and instead of battling for the
                                maintenance of the Constitution and the Union, and for the honor of
                                the stars and stripes, it will be a crusade against slavery. With
                                Kentucky a neutral State to hold out the olive-branch of peace, the
                                hands of those who deplore the present condition of our national
                                affairs, and pray for an honorable adjustment of difficulties, will
                                be strengthened sufficient, perhaps, to quiet passions, and allay
                                the jealousy and hatred which have brought on this conflict. This is
                                my only hope To talk about coercion is to admit that we,through
                                whose veins the same blood run, and who inherit the same spirit, may
                                be enslaved. We may exhaust all our means, and sacrifice our best
                                blood in such an effort, and find that we have left for our portion
                                degradation, bankruptcy and ruin. By giving countenance to
                                Kentucky's neutrality we may have the Southern border of our State
                                free from disturbance - then we will have no need of hearing so much
                                about invasion, arms, and protection as heretofore. I must confess I
                                have  no hope that the
                                resolutions will pass, but they are my honest convictions, and I
                                hope they will be so regarded by this House.
                            Mr. GRESHAM. Mr. Speaker: I think the solutions and the speech of the
                                gentleman from Johnson, taken together with his declaration that he
                                does not expect the resolutions to pass, amount to the next thing to
                                an insult to the members of this body; therefore I move that the
                                resolutions be rejected.
                            Mr. POLK. I based my last paragraph upon what has been stated lately
                                here on this floor On the subject of the neutrality of the State of
                                Kentucky. There was no intention to insult - not the least.
                            Mr. ROBBINS. I hope the gentleman will be treated with due courtesy.
                                There are a great many resolutions offered here and rejected; and I
                                think it is due to every man that his motions and resolutions should
                                be treated respectfully. I would therefore I move to amend the
                                resolution of gentleman from Harrison so as to make it refer the
                                resolution to a select committee of five.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN. (Mr. Edson in the Chair.) A motion to reject takes
                                precedence of a motion to refer.
                            Mr. ROBBINS. I don't want the reference because I would be regarded
                                as in favor of the resolution, but simply to be courteous toward the
                                gentleman from Johnson.
                            Mr. BUNDY. I am for tolerating the utmost freedom of discussion and
                                debate in this House, but I am utterly astonished at the
                                introduction of these resolutions. If I were a representative or
                                citizen of Kentucky I should be opposed to this proposition; but
                                coming in here and proposing to sympathize with Kentucky in doing us
                                she pleases, when the Federal Government is in a state of war -
                                sympathizing with her in keeping granaries and store-houses, and
                                recruiting soldiers for the Southern Confederacy - to stand by
                                whilst she maintains such a neutrality, and sympathize with it. I am
                                utterly astonished that any gentleman should offer such a
                                proposition. I will now move to lay it on the table.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN. (Mr. Edson in the chair.) I hope the gentleman
                                from Henry will withdraw that motion, and let us come to a square
                                rote.
                            The motion was withdrawn.
                            Mr. CRAIN demanded the previous question.
                            Mr. ALLEN. I ask the gentleman to withdraw the demand. We have been
                                favored with an elaborate speech in favor of the resolutions, and I
                                hope some gentleman will have an opportunity to reply.
                            The demand was withdrawn.
                            Mr. POLK. Mr. Speaker: I am sorry this has created so much feeling.
                                The resolutions are nothing but my own candid sentiments. I have
                                offered them without consulting any one, and now, without further
                                discussion, if the House will permit, I will just withdraw the
                                resolutions.
                            Mr. ALLEN. I object.
                            Mr. McLEAN. I do think this is a most unusual, unprecedented course
                                of proceeding to ward a gentleman on this floor. Sir, I object to
                                the resolutions as much as any man here. I think the position of
                                neutrality on the part of Kentucky is worse than direct secession.
                                But the gentleman from Johnson represents here an intelligent
                                constituency - as much so as the gentleman from Knox or myself - and
                                he has a right, in the exercise of his own discretion, to oiler what
                                resolutions he pleases, and to have them treated with that respect
                                which is due to his position.
                            Mr. ALLEN interposing. I will ask the gentleman if a resolution
                                breathing treason in every word, is entitled to the respect of this
                                House.
                            Mr. McLEAN. In reply to that, Mr. Speaker, I say that the gentleman
                                from Johnson may honestly and candidly believe that the sentiments
                                are not traitorous. The gentleman from Knox may think they are. It
                                is merely the matter of opinion on the part of gentlemen. I myself
                                object to the resolutions as decidedly as the gentleman from Knox.
                                No resolution could be introduced here upon which I could give a
                                more emphatic dissent than upon this. But I think now the proper way
                                to treat these resolutions is simply to refer them - now, since the
                                gentleman seeing they are in the nature of a firebrand, has asked to
                                withdraw them; and, my God! shall the request be refused? I think
                                not sir. I do think not. I do think a refusal would be the most
                                unreasonable, unauthorized and discourteous course toward a
                                gentlemen on this floor that I ever heard off more especially toward
                                a gentleman who has obtruded himself as little upon the House, and
                                occupied as little of its time in making political speeches as any
                                member here.
                            Mr. GRESHAM. At a time like this, when the question is whether this
                                government shall be maintained or not - when our fellow-citizens are
                                offering to sacrifice their all to maintain the government -
                                offering their very lives - and a gentleman comes in here and offers
                                resolutions and says he recognizes the position of a State (not a
                                person) that sympathises with the enemies of the government - says
                                it is riot an improper thing in Kentucky to declare that she is not
                                in favor of this government at all.
                            Mr. ROBERTS interposing. The resolutions say: "We will respect the
                                sympathy which Kentucky has for the seceded States."
                            Mr. GRESHAM. Well, I can't let the occasion pass without saying
                                distinctly that we do not recognize the right of a State to
                                sympathize with secession. I think we ought to treat the resolutions
                                as severely as the rules will permit. I think it proper, under the
                                circumstances, to reject the resolutions. I will say, however, that
                                if the gentleman from Johnson wishes to withdraw them, I am willing
                                he should; still I think the proper course would be to reject them.
                                I do not know the gentleman from Johnson. Perhaps his object has
                                been good and fair; but if he introduces resolutions here which are
                                traitorous, it is our duty to treat them as they deserve.
                            Mr. McLEAN made a question of order, that Mr. Polk had the right to
                                withdraw his resolutions; that, until a vote of the House had been
                                taken on them, they were entirely under his own control.
                            The SPEAKER pro tem. The Chair decides against the
                                point of order.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN. I desire to say a word now, particularly as I am
                                one that objected to the withdrawal of the resolutions. The course
                                now proposed is neither unusual or unprecedented. It  is very common in all representative
                                bodies to reject propositions submitted by its members. And it is
                                not an uncommon occurrence to refuse to permit a member to withdraw
                                his proposition. And it is eminently fit and proper that these
                                resolutions should not be withdrawn. The gentleman from Johnson has
                                introduced a set of resolutions here which I hold breathe treason in
                                every line and every syllable, and he has accompanied them with a
                                carefully prepared speech; and now, should this House permit them to
                                go forth to the world without instantly showing to the world that it
                                does not assert to one single proposition contained either in the
                                resolutions or in the speech? No, sir, without intending any
                                personal disrespect to the gentleman, I say that a decent respect
                                for ourselves demand that we should say to the world that there is
                                not a member on this floor who sat silently by and permitted the
                                utterance of treason here by solemn resolutions. No, sir, at such a
                                time as this, when all are loyal to the government, responding as
                                one man to the call of the President of the United States, and ready
                                to march and do battle for the constitution and laws, and for the
                                maintenance of the government; at such a time, when we have such
                                resolutions presented, it is a duty to our citizen soldiers that we
                                should proclaim in a voice of thunder that we will not tolerate such
                                sentiments upon this floor. What do the resolutions propose? Why,
                                that Kentucky, with all her sympathy with the seceding States, shall
                                be permitted to occupy a position of armed neutrality; and from that
                                position declare that this government shall not attempt to enforce
                                the laws over the seceding States, for the reason that to admit the
                                coercion and the punishment of rebels is virtually saying that the
                                government has power to make slaves of a portion of its citizens.
                                Sir, if that doctrine is to be proclaimed without a dissenting voice
                                on this floor, to what purpose have we been at work here,
                                appropriating $600,000 for arms, and $2,000,000 for the common
                                defense and for the punishment of traitors and rebels? Have we been
                                doing these things to prepare ourselves now to tacitly admit to the
                                world that our sympathies are with the traitors of Kentucky? and
                                that Kentucky must be permitted to occupy her present treasonable
                                position toward the General Government? I hope the House with one
                                voice will vote to reject these resolutions. And while the gentleman
                                from Johnson may claim the right to utter such sentiments as to him
                                may seem right and proper, he should remember that even the liberty
                                of speech 'Should be controlled. I do not understand that, under
                                this right of the freedom of speech, any man has a right to come
                                upon this floor and proclaim treason. I hope there will not be a
                                solitary man raising his voice against the rejection of the
                                resolutions, except the member that introduced them.
                            Mr. DOBBINS wished to state that at least the first part of the
                                resolutions met with his condemnation. He did not think it our duty
                                to sympathize with Kentucky or any other State that could not
                                sympathize with us. He could sympathize with no man that refused
                                sympathy now in our efforts to uphold the government. He sympathized
                                with the friends of this government, not with its enemies. This
                                government as Washington framed it suited him. We have lived and
                                prospered under it for three quarters of a century. He knew the
                                people of Kentucky by living there by their hospitality, and there
                                was not a more honorable, high-minded and generous people on earth.
                                But still when he found a man in Kentucky sympathizing with the
                                enemies of this goy, eminent he could not sympathize with such a
                                man. Neither did he deem it the duty of the Legislature of Indiana
                                to dictate the course that Kentucky shall pursue. Let the people of
                                Kentucky in their sovereign capacity make their own choice between
                                this government and the Jeff. Davis government. Let them decide
                                their own destiny. He hoped they would not take the post-don of
                                neutrality, but stand up firmly and bravely to sustain our
                                government as it is. He believed Kentucky would do this. Her voice
                                had just been heard in thunder tones in favor of the Union. We had
                                already said that we are not going to war on her constitutional
                                rights. We had said this by resolution. As far as that goes it was
                                well enough; but he could riot respect the sympathy of Kentucky with
                                the cotton States' movement. He had no sympathy in that direction.
                                He detested a secessionist as much as an abolitionist. He trusted,
                                however, that the House would treat the gentleman from Johnson with
                                the respect due to his personal worth, whilst it would fearlessly
                                avow its dissent to his resolutions.
                            Mr. NEBEKER demanded the previous question, and under its force the
                                resolutions were rejected - yeas 78, nays 0.
                            Mr. POLK, asking to be excused from voting, said: The spirit and
                                words of my resolutions have been egregiously misconstrued. I can
                                say with all assurance that they are not traitorous in their spirit
                                and intention. I look to the reconstruction of our Union, and I use
                                such arguments as this: that if Kentucky will occupy neutral ground
                                she may sometime act as an efficient peace agent. Of course I expect
                                for myself to find protection under the stars and stripes, and do
                                all I can to defend the integrity and honor of the power they
                                represent. Subsequently, he read language used by the President to
                                the Hon. Wm. L. Underwood, in which that high functionary himself
                                derived consolation and hope for the Union from the neutral position
                                of Kentucky - language which he supposed amply justified everything
                                he had offered.
                            So the resolutions were rejected.
                        
                        
                            PERSONAL.
                            Mr. PROSSER referred to a personal explanation, printed in this
                                paper's report of the proceedings of yesterday, made by Mr. Moorman,
                                and erroneously attributed to him. And he requested the proper
                                correction.
                            Mr. ROBBINS had leave to record his vote in the affirmative on the final passage of the contraband bill
                                [S. 5] yesterday in the House.
                            Messrs Turner, Heffren and Hurd had leave of absence.
                        
                        
                            EXECUTION STAY LAW.
                            The SPEAKER announced the special order, viz: the consideration of
                                Mr. Moss' execution stay bill, &c.
                            Mr. VEATCH, from the Judiciary Committee, had
                                leave to return Mr. Williams' bill, [27] and Mr. Stotsenberg's
                                bills, [23 and 28] with
                                refer-  ence to the same
                                subject, with a recommendation that they do pass.
                            Mr. PARRETT suggested that these bills be laid on the table and
                                printed, and lie over till after the recess of the session.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG objected, because the motion was conditional.
                            The SPEAKER suggested that discussion might be well enough now.
                            Mr. PARRETT suggested the printing of the hills early, so we might
                                have them to take home.
                            Mr. NEBEKER had gone as far any to do what was claimed by the
                                southern border. He had voted for the arms bill and the six regiment
                                bill, in which they have the preference. Now these men from the
                                southern counties, who had parried us not to weigh dollars and cents
                                against the protection of life, were demanding either a relict law
                                or permission to feed the seceded States. They claimed that they had
                                no other outlet for their produce; but he referred to the eastern
                                markets - the same that we have in the northern counties. This
                                market could be reached by them, costing but four cents more than it
                                costs us in the northern counties; and then, in his turn, he asked
                                them not to balance four cents against the credit of the State of
                                Indiana. There were other markets besides Louisville and New
                                Orleans. Besides a stay law would not prevent Kentucky creditors
                                from suing our people. They would come through the United States
                                Courts, which would not respect our stay laws. He lived on the
                                western border, in a central county. He had a few bushels of corn;
                                but he would take twenty cents a bushel for it north, rather than
                                get a dollar South. He would not feed traitors. Warren county would
                                do her part in this fight - she would do the job herself on
                                contract. He affirmed that the State was full of patriotism all
                                over, and - Warren county had her full share, all sectional
                                allusions here.
                            Mr. PARRETT moved to lay the report of the Judiciary
                                    Committee and the two bills accompanying on the table,
                                and that 200 copies' of the bills be printed. The printing and delay
                                would do us a great deal more good than debate. For if there is any
                                reason in the proposed recess, it was found in this question of a
                                relief law.
                            Mr. ROBBINS wanted the understanding that the printing should be done
                                by to-morrow noon.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG said it seemed to him that the House should indicate
                                its preferences amongst the bills before us. He was not sure about
                                the Senate's acceptance of the proposition for a recess of the
                                session.
                            Mr. PACKARD was in favor of the motion to print. He was unprepared to
                                vote for any relief bill. He would wait for the instructions of his
                                constituents.
                            Mr. ROBERTS called for the reading of the pending bills for
                                information. Mr. Moss' stay bill (15) was read by the clerk,
                                together with Mr. Stotsenberg's (23), Mr. Williams' (27), and Mr.
                                Stotsenberg's (28), for the
                                redemption of real estate. Mr. UNDERWOOD hoped the motion would not
                                prevail. The Senate had postponed the recess resolution till
                                to-morrow, and he hoped they would not concur. He preferred
                                immediate action on the bill.
                            Mr. Parrett's motion to lay on the table and print was agreed to, and
                                the order was made accordingly.
                        
                        
                            JEFFERSONVILLE PRISON.
                            Mr. Jones, of Vermillion, from the Committee on the
                                    Penitentiary, returned his $20,000 penitentiary
                                appropriation bill (13), with amendments striking out "20" and
                                inserting "15."
                            Mr. JENKINSON moved to recommit the bill with instructions to amend
                                by way of substitute requiring 200 of the Southern prisoners to be
                                detailed for work on the Northern prison, and appropriating $15,000
                                toward the completion of the Northern prison, and $15,000 to be
                                invested in materials for manufacture in the Southern prison.
                            Mr. J. said his proposition was to take 200 men from the Southern
                                prison and set them at work on the construction of the Northern
                                prison, and to appropriate $15,000 to carry on the work. He
                                considered this better than to take $20,000 to buy stock and set
                                those 300 convicts to work on account of the State.
                            Mr. FISHER considered that some provision should be made, but it
                                should be carefully considered; and his policy also was to place the
                                convict labor as much as possible on the Northern prison.
                            Mr. VEATCH proposed to add to the instructions, "that there shall be
                                appointed by the Governor a competent and skillful controller of the
                                manufacturing department of the prison, who shall be present and lay
                                out and superintend the work, but shall not have any other charge of
                                the convicts; and shall receive ---- dollars for salary, to be paid
                                quarterly;" and adding these words: "So as to authorize the
                                employment of convicts in the manufacture of arms and munitions of
                                war."
                            He said he had been informed by the prison Warden, at Jeffersonville,
                                that probably by June there would not be more than thirty men
                                employed in that prison amongst four hundred; that there were good
                                blacksmiths amongst them, and in ten days time he could have one
                                hundred and fifty men at work on the manufacture of arms. This was
                                certainly a good proposition, now when we are sending all over the
                                world to procure munitions of war. It had been suggested also, that
                                these prisoners could be employed in the manufacture of clothing and
                                tents, which we are also sending abroad to procure. Whilst a portion
                                of the convicts should be sent to work on the northern prison the
                                remainder ought to be employed at Jeffersonville on these
                                manufacturies. It would be certainly unwise to keep them idle,
                                having to feed and clothe them, whilst their labor can be turned
                                into use for the State in the manufacture of heavy guns,
                                gun-carriages, shot and shell, just as well perhaps as they could be
                                furnished from the shops in New Albany and Indianapolis. He had
                                understood that but twelve cannon had been ordered, and how far
                                would twelve guns go towards fortifying the whole southern border?
                                He could hardly speak for the border without danger of
                                misconstruction. But the State must be fortified with cannon. Men
                                will be called out and they must have guns, powder, shot, shell,
                                grape and canister, and we have not got them. Why should we hesitate
                                then to employ all the means in our power for the defense of the
                                State?
                            
                            Mr. SHERMAN. What would be the probable cost of the necessary
                                machinery at Jefferson-ville to commence this work?
                            Mr. VEATCH. Not a single cent. All the machinery for this coarse work
                                was there. Because we can't make Sharpe's rifles, or the Minnie, or
                                the Enfield gun, that was no reason why we should not go to work on
                                those munitions which are coarser but equally necessary. If we can't
                                do all we should do what we may, and be satisfied with that.
                            Mr. KNOWLTON. The gentleman ought to know that arms made by green
                                hands would not be fit for use.
                            Mr. VEATCH. Could they not make gun carriages, shot, tents and
                                clothing?
                            Mr. KNOWLTON. They might make cart wheels and carts, but they could
                                not make guns. I undertake to say that as knowing something about
                                the business.
                            Mr. JENKINSON now moved to refer the whole subject to the select
                                committee, without regard to instructions.
                            Mr. PARRETT desired that the committee inquire into the propriety of
                                so amending the bill as to require the convicts, in part or
                                altogether hereafter to be sent to the northern instead of the
                                southern prison.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG proposed to amend further by inserting a section
                                providing from what counties or parts of the State hereafter
                                prisoners shall be sent to the Northern Prison, and from what
                                counties to the Southern Prison.
                            Mr. Jenkinson's motion was then agreed to; and the subject was
                                referred to Messrs. Fisher, Jenkinson, Shermnn, McLean and
                                Veatch.
                        
                        
                            THE MILITIA BILL.
                            On motion of Mr. RAGAN, the Senate amendments to the militia bill,
                                [H. R. 21] just announced by Mr. Brown, their Secretary, were taken
                                up and concurred in by consent, excepting the striking out from the
                                eleventh section the clause requiring the Governor to select the
                                colonels for the regiments they are to command; and therefore -
                            Mr. JENKINSON demanded the yeas and nays, and the same being ordered
                                and taken, resuited - yeas 51, nays 30.
                            So the House concurred in the amendments of the Senate.
                            Mr. GRESHAM, from the Committee on Military
                                    Affairs, returned Mr. Williams' border defense bill
                                [7]; also, Mr. Grain's treason bill [l], with the expression of
                                opinion that further legislation on these subjects was
                                inexpedient.
                            Mr. McLEAN from the select committee of eleven, returned Mr.
                                Jenkinson's joint resolution for Kentucky Commissioners, the
                                committee recommending that it lie on the table.
                        
                        
                            AMALGAMY EVIDENCE.
                            Mr. ORR, from the Committee on Rights and
                                    Privileges, returned Mr. Owens' amalgamation evidence
                                bill [16], reporting the opinion, that intermarriages with negroes
                                are null under the Constitution; and that a white person who would
                                debase himself so low as to intermarry with a negro, ought not to be
                                debased any lower by the action of this Legislature, and reports a
                                motion to indefinitely postpone the bill.
                            Mr. OWENS defended the bill, until -
                            Mr. BUNDY demanded the previous question and under its force, the
                                House refused to cone in the report.
                            Mr. OWENS moved that it be considered engrossed and read the third
                                time now.
                            The SPEAKER suggested that it should amended so that a white man
                                intermarrying a negress should not be allowed to testify in a case
                                where a negro is a party. [Laughter.]
                            On motion by Mr. BINGHAM, the bill referred to the Committee
                                    on the Judiciary.
                            On motion by Mr. ROBBINS, it was ordered that the Committee
                                    of Eleven, to whom sundry resolutions have been
                                referred, report on to morrow at 10 o'clock, A. M.
                            Here the House took a recess till 2 o'clock P.M.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            Mr. FISHER, from the Committee on Ways and Means,
                                returned his subsistence commissioners bill, [33] with amendments,
                                viz: making Commissioners Calvin Fletcher, Jr., of Marion; Lucius
                                Rush, of Vigo; and Simeon Standige, of Bartholomew; and filling the
                                other blank in the bill with "$3" (a day for Commissioners).The
                                amendments reported were adopted.
                            And then the bill, as amended, was ordered to be engrossed,
                                considered as engrossed, and passed to the third reading - yeas 69,
                                nays 0.

                            
                                SCHOOL LAW.
                                Mr. VEATCH, from the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary, returned his bill [24] to amend the school
                                    law, without amendments, recommending its passage.
                                The report was concurred in and the bill ordered to be engrossed:
                                    and then, on his motion, the bill was considered as engrossed
                                    and passed to the third reading - yeas 73, nays 0 - the title,
                                    An Act to amend sections 38, 126, 137, 162, and to repeal
                                    section 138 of the school law. [The amendments correct errors in
                                    the enrollment of the act. The enrolled act provided that the
                                    County Superintendents should have power to select text-books,
                                    whilst they only have power to recommend. The second section,
                                    gives $800 instead of $1,000 to the State Superintendent for
                                    clerk hire. The third section makes the power of the State Board
                                    merely advisory as to text books; and changes the terms
                                    affecting the teachers' license from "good throughout the year,"
                                    to "good throughout the State."
                            
                            
                                THE MILITIA LAW.
                                Mr. PARRETT submitted an order to print the militia bill [H. R.
                                    21] in the weeklies of the Indiana Journal and
                                    the Indiana Stale Sentinel.
                                Mr. CRAIN stated that it would cost $500.
                                On the motion of Mr. STOTSENBERG, it was laid on the table.
                            
                            
                                PROTEST AGAINST THE CONTRABAND BILL.
                                Mr. HAYES submitted the following, which was ordered to b3
                                    entered on the journal:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Mr. Speaker, the undersigned protests against the
                                                action of this House on yesterday in passing Senate
                                                bill No. 5, entitled, "An act defining certain
                                                felonies and prescribing punishment therefor," for
                                                the following reasons:
                                            While I indorse every sentiment contained in said
                                                bill, and know that no people in Indiana will take
                                                more pleas- 
                                                ure in obeying its provisions than the people of
                                                Madison country, including myself, I must say that,
                                                I look upon said act as being an act of usurpation
                                                on the part of our state. The bill, in my opinion,
                                                regulates commerce between this State and the other
                                                States of this Union. The Constitution of the United
                                                States declares that "The Congress shall have power:
                                                - * * To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and
                                                among the several States." Believing, therefore,
                                                that this Legislature, had no power to enact such a
                                                law, I desire that this may go upon the journal as a
                                                reason why I took no part in the enactment of such
                                                law.
                                            
                                                JOHN HAYES.
                                            
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                ORDER OF VOLUNTEER COMPANIES.
                                Mr. HOLCOMB submitted a motion to resume the report of the
                                    special committee of inquiry into the organization and
                                    arrangement of the various military companies that have tendered
                                    their service to the State.
                                Mr. VEATCH had been informed that five regiments had been formed
                                    and organized under the six regiment bill; and that there were
                                    about eighty companies still standing out and asking for
                                    service. Considering that the House of Representatives is not
                                    Commander-in-Chief, he supposed it could have nothing to do with
                                    this arrangement, and the consideration of the report would be
                                    spending time to no purpose.
                                Messrs. Holcornb, Rigari, Veatch, Robbing, Grain, Fisher, Orr,
                                    and others, founded various statements and submitted various
                                    considerations under this motion.
                                Mr. HOLCOMB (by unanimous consent) submitted the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Adjutant General
                                                be requested to furnish to this House instanter a
                                                list of the companies that have been organized into
                                                the six regiments of State troops.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. KNOWLTON proposed to recommit the report with instructions to
                                    examine the books of the Adjutant General, and report to-morrow
                                    morning at 9 o'clock whether the troops have been organized
                                    under the six regiment act, and whether they have been accepted
                                    under the provisions of said act.
                                On motion by Mr. UNDERWOOD, Mr. Holcomb's resolution was laid on
                                    the table.
                                Mr. GRESHAM. There had been either gross ignorance or gross
                                    injustice in the acceptance of these companies. He undertook to
                                    say that where men have spent money to organize companies which
                                    have come up here and have been driven home again, the people
                                    ought to know how it was done. He hoped investigation would be
                                    had. Under the six regiment bill the Governor had no right to
                                    enlist for a term longer than twelve months; but now he
                                    understood that where companies say they are willing to enlist
                                    for three years they will be received in preference to those
                                    willing to serve only for twelve months.
                                Mr. PARRETT. It was about this way: If they can get a list and
                                    they are in from a certain gentleman's county, then it's all
                                    right; if not, it's all wrong. He did not suppose anything could
                                    come of the proposed investigation. He did not believe there had
                                    been any fraud in the case, and he did not think there had been
                                    a great deal of favoritism. Military men had managed this matter
                                    to suit themselves. The Legislature had yielded to them, and now
                                    they were pitching into each other. He said now - Let them fight
                                    it out among themselves. But suppose there had been favoritism
                                    and injustice, it was no prerogative of this body to rectify and
                                    correct these matters. * * * It was worse than child's play.
                                Mr. ATKISSON was willing to vote for the reference to the
                                    committee.
                                Mr. BINGHAN did not think there had been any favoritism, and
                                    submitted the following amendment 10 the resolution: "And report
                                    the companies, their Captains and counties from which the said
                                    regiments have been organized," which was accepted.
                                The resolution as amended was adopted, and the subject was
                                    referred accordingly.
                                Mr. MOSS had leave of absence on account of sickness.
                            
                            
                                SPECIAL COURT EXPENSES.
                                Mr. SMITH of Bartholomew, from the select, committee thereon,
                                    returned Mr. Stotsenberg's Judges extra-compensation bill, [11]
                                    with an amendment providing that where Judges preside out of
                                    their circuits, where there is incompetency, the county treasury
                                    shall pay for the service "upon the presentation of his itemized
                                    account."
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN, (Mr. Lane in the Chair,) said the sum of the
                                    compensation paid for these extra services of judges for special
                                    terms, and in cases where there is incompetency, (as might be
                                    seen now in the Auditor's office,) was about as large as the
                                    regular salaries of all the judges in the State. But he would
                                    ask the gentleman from Bartholomew, upon what principle he would
                                    throw this expense upon the counties. He would support the bill
                                    if the gentleman would amend it so as to require the suitors to
                                    pay this expense.
                                Mr. SMITH replied.
                                Mr. BINGHAM. The policy of the amendment was good. It was
                                    observable that where the judge might be looking for his pay
                                    from the State, he would do "his business leisurely. But by
                                    changing the pay to the county the judge is placed face to face
                                    with his employees; and he was inclined to think that herein was
                                    a consideration that might secure the dispatch of business.
                                Mr. BUNDY. It was certainly expedient that those judges holding
                                    in the places of incompetent judges;' and it seemed to him there
                                    was no injustice in their being paid out of the county
                                    treasury.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG would not introduce a bill to pay for a service
                                    where there was not a full equivalent rendered. He showed the
                                    necessity of this bill by example. He was very well satisfied
                                    with the amendment proposed by the select committee.
                                Mr. RAGAN. If we were paying as much for special terms as for
                                    regular terms, there must be something wrong in it, and he would
                                    rather have no special terms. He objected to the novel
                                    proposition to pay the judge out of the county treasury.
                                This provision would be at war with the constitutional principle
                                    prohibiting local legislation.
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN, (Mr. Lane in the chair,) proposed to recommit
                                    the bill with instructions to amend so that in all cases where
                                    the judge is incompetent to try the cause the venue shall be
                                    changed to another circuit.
                                Mr. PARRETT proposed to add- "and inquire further, whether some
                                    other method of trying 
                                    causes than by change of venue cannot be devised that would be
                                    less expensive and more convenient.
                                Mr. P. supported his proposition. The case might be sent to the
                                    common pleas, giving that court, for the special case, the
                                    powers and jurisdiction of the circuit courts. Another plan
                                    might be for some judge to select a competent lawyer to preside,
                                    and he would let the incompetent judge pay for this service, and
                                    not look to the treasuries for it.
                                Mr. CRAIN insisted that it was folly for the House to be taking
                                    up time on this subject. It could not pass the Senate, and
                                    perhaps hardly the House. Therefore he moved to lay the whole
                                    subject on the table.
                                Accordingly the subject was laid on the table.
                            
                            
                                THE CONTRACT SYSTEM.
                                Mr. MUTZ submitted a resolution to the effect that the Governor
                                    be requested to furnish this House forthwith with copies of all
                                    contracts made for clothing, tents, gun-carriages, ordnance
                                    stores and all articles, except subsistence, for the use of the
                                    volunteers under the laws of the State: and to report whether
                                    proposals for said contracts were advertised, and whether said
                                    contracts were awarded to parties within the State; and that he
                                    is hereby requested to advertise before contracting, and to
                                    award contracts to parties within the State, when not
                                    inconsistent with public interest.
                                Mr. FISHER and Mr. BINGHAM considered that the latter part of the
                                    resolution should be stricken out - that which relates to
                                    advertising, &c - that matter being in conflict with the
                                    bill passed to-day, for subsistance commissioners.
                                On motion by Mr. McLEAN, the resolution was referred to the
                                        Committee on Military Affairs.
                            
                            
                                STAMPING WORTHLESS BANK BILLS.
                                Mr. MeLEAN introduced a bill [36] to provide for stamping
                                    counterfeit, worthless and uncurrent bank bills, and prescribing
                                    the duty of the Auditor of State in relation thereto; which was
                                    passed to the second reading.
                            
                            
                                AN ARMED MILITIA.
                                Mr. JONES, of Tippecanoe, presented the memorial by way of
                                    resolutions, adopted at a public meeting at Lafayette, on the
                                    4th of May, asking for arms to be put into the hands of the
                                    people, and the militia to be subject to instant marching
                                    orders.
                                The paper was laid on the table - Mr. JONES stating that the
                                    meeting was held about the time that the people of Tippecanoe
                                    county (who had half of them volunteered) were informed that the
                                    six regiment bill was to authorize but three regiments.
                                Mr. FISHER, from the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means, returned the communication from the Board
                                    of Control of the Northern State Prison, and asked that it be
                                    referred to the select committee on the subject of the State
                                    prison bills.
                                It was so ordered; and then
                                The House adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            FRIDAY, May 10, 1861.
                        
                        On motion by Mr. HULL, a resolution was adopted, to-wit:
                        That the committee appointed under a joint resolution of the two Houses
                            to investigate the Commissary's Department are hereby authorized and
                            empowered to send for persons and papers, and to examine such persons
                            under oath as they may deem necessary in order for a full investigation
                            of the Commissary's Department, and that said committee are hereby
                            further authorized and empowered to inquire into and examine the
                            purchase of provisions and supplies for the troops by said
                            Commissary.
                        On motion by Mr. HAMILTON, it was
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the committee of
                                            the Senate now investigating the provisions
                                        furnished at Camp Morton, instructed to inquire into the
                                        management of the Quarter master's Department, the prices
                                        paid for such articles, are furnished under direction of the
                                        Quartermaster General, the quality of the same; and whether
                                        they are purchased by public or private contract, and such
                                        other investors touching the management of that Department
                                        as said committee may deem correct.
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            THE TWO MILLION LOAN BILL.
                            The PRESIDENT announced the consideration of the unfinished business
                                of yesterday the loan bill, H. R. 22 - the question being on the
                                motion pending at adjournment to reconsider the vote on which the
                                substitute [Mr. Claypool's] for section 2 was adopted.
                            Mr. MARCH. I voted for this amendment on yesterday, but on further
                                consideration I see no necessity for employing these Commissioners
                                at all, and I shall vote to reconsider with a view to conferring the
                                duties in that section upon the Auditor and Treasurer of State.
                                There was no plausible reason presented to my mind except that their
                                financial position would give credit to the thing. Still I think the
                                credit of Indiana does not depend upon anything of that kind, and
                                that these bonds could be sold by the State officers a great deal
                                better, all things considered, than to appoint a Commissioner for
                                that purpose.
                            Mr. MURRAY. Upon hearing the explanation of the gentleman, I am
                                willing to vote with him for the reconsideration for the purpose he
                                indicates. I believe that to be the correct policy for this
                                Legislature to pursue.
                            Mr RAY. My reason for voting for the reconsideration is the same as
                                is given by the gentleman from Delaware and the gentleman from
                                Elkhart. I think there is no propriety in employing other gentlemen
                                outside of the officers of State to do this negotiation. I do not
                                know upon what principle we could justify such a vote here or
                                elsewhere - to employ gentlemen at a per diem of
                                five dollars a day to go abroad and negotiate bonds, and thereby
                                supersede the Agent of State, whose duty it is to do this very
                                thing.
                            Mr. WAGNER. One single statement ought to convince every man of the
                                peculiar fitness of Mr. James M. Ray for the place assigned him in
                                this bill. He has been identified with the moneyed transactions of
                                the State almost from their very incipiency; he carried through for
                                twenty years the old State bank; and has more information upon the
                                subject of financial matters than any other man in the State,
                                probably. But I am opposed to this whole bond system, for you cannot
                                adopt any rules that will keep a man from stealing if he wants to
                                while negotiating these bonds. And I am opposed to paying these
                                commissioners for their services, for I desire to make it a matter
                                of honor with those gentlemen. And I object to dispensing with their
                                services, because the State officers are not so competent, and I
                                mean  no disparagement in
                                saying so. How can two of them reside in the city of New York for a
                                month or two, and attend to their duties here? According to their
                                oath of office they cannot do it, even if they possessed the
                                necessary financial abilities.
                            [A message from the Governor announced his signature and approval of
                                Senator Ferguson's bill No. 10.]
                            The PRESIDENT laid before the Senate a communication from H.
                                McCulloch, asking that his name may be struck from the bill [H. R.
                                22] under consideration as one of the proposed Commissioners.
                            Mr. COBB was glad the gentleman had declined riving his services to
                                us under this bill. He was not in favor of giving to any man such
                                large powers, under such circumstances, without their giving a
                                sufficient bond to indemnify the State, for it would be a bad
                                precedent. He thought the motion to reconsider ought to be carried,
                                for the reason assigned by the Senator from Delaware, [Mr. March
                                ]
                            The motion to reconsider was agreed to.
                            Mr. MURRAY (for Mr. Conner) moved to reconsider the vote by which the
                                amendment [Mr. Ray's] to the substitute was adopted.
                        
                        
                            ADJOURNMENT TO A DAY CERTAIN.
                            The hour (10 o'clock) for the consideration of the special order
                                having arrived, the PRESIDENT directed the Secretary to read the
                                House resolution, proposing an adjourn merit from to-day till the
                                21st inst.
                            Mr. WOLFE proposed to amend by a resolution proposing to adjourn sine die on Monday next.
                            On motion by Mr. CAMPBELL - yeas 24, nays 20 - the resolution and
                                amendments were laid on the table.
                        
                        
                            THE LOAN BILL.
                            The Senate resumed the consideration of the two million loan bill, H.
                                R. 22. Mr. NEW COMB regarded individual bonds as unnecessary, but
                                was willing to vote for it; and you could not require of the Slate
                                officers $600,000 bonds. He hoped the vote would be
                                reconsidered.
                            Mr. MILLER. Thought too much time was spent upon this subject. Since
                                one of the gentlemen named in the bill seems to think there is a
                                hardship in requiring a bond of these Commissioners, it may be so;
                                but could not be, in fact, a matter of much consequence. Let a
                                compromise of views be made by substituting James M. Ray and the
                                Agent of State in place of the Commissioners named, requiring no
                                bond. When these funds come into the hands of the Treasurer of State
                                his bond should be increased.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON was fully convinced that the best men to negotiate
                                this loan are the ones indicated in the bill - at least two of them.
                                The State officers are not the men to negotiate this loan; it must
                                be done by some well known gentlemen in whose capacities we have
                                implicit confidence. The compromise proposed by the gentleman from
                                St. Joseph should include the Auditor and Treasurer of State instead
                                of the Agent of State. It would be best to make a compromise without
                                any feeling upon the question of of the principal shall
                                simply maturing this bill. He favored the reconsideration of the
                                bill.
                            Mr. BLAIR demanded the previous question and there being a second (26
                                Senators) the motion to reconsider was agreed to.
                            On motion by Mr. CONNER, the amendment (Mr. Ray's) was laid on the
                                table.
                            Mr. MILLER moved to amend by substituting James M. Ray and the Agent
                                of State for the persons named in the bill, no bond required and no
                                compensation above necessary expenses.
                            On motion by Mr. STUDABAKER, the amendment was laid on the table.
                            Mr. RAY proposed to amend by striking out the Commissioners named in
                                the bill and inserting in lieu thereof the Auditor, Treasurer and
                                Agent of State.
                            On motion by Mr. STUDABAKER - yeas 21, nays 19 - the amendment was
                                laid on the table.
                            On motion of Mr. MELLETT, the amendment was amended, with the consent
                                of the author, so as to make the Commissioners' bonds $200,000 each
                                instead of $100,000.
                            Mr. RAY proposed to amend section 2 by adding thereto these words,
                                "together with all exchange and any premium which may accrue or may
                                be received by said Commissioners, except so much thereof as the
                                Treasurer of State may require for payments in the city of New
                                York.
                            The amendment to the amendment was adopted and the amendment as
                                amended was adopted.
                            Mr. MARCH added to the section by consent, these words: "Such
                                appointees shall give like bond with the original commission."
                            Mr. MARCH offered the following additional section:
                            In case it becomes unnecessary to sell all of said bonds such unsold
                                bonds shall be returned to the Auditor of State, who shall register
                                their number and denomination, and they shall be destroyed in the
                                presence of the Auditor, Treasurer, and Secretary of State, and the
                                fact shall be recorded by the Auditor and signed by him and the
                                Secretary and Treasurer of State.
                            Which was adopted.
                            Mr. CRAVENS offered the following:
                            SEC. - The tax herein provided for the payment of the interest and
                                the gradual liquidation of the principal shall not be diminished,
                                but the same shall be levied and collected annually until the bonds
                                herein authorized to be issued shall have been paid or redeemed.
                            Which was adopted.
                            Mr. ANTHONY offered the following amendment:
                            Amend by inserting in the second line of the fourth section, between
                                the words "of " and "is" these words: "or in case any of said
                                commissioners shall refuse to serve as such."
                            Which was adopted.
                            On motion by Mr. STUDABAKER, the bill was considered as engrossed,
                                and read the third time.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL by consent added to section eight these words:
                            Provided, That notice of the person and place in said city be given
                                by the Governor of the State of Indiana immediately, in one or more
                                daily papers in the city of New York, by thirty days publication
                                thereof.
                            
                            The bill as amended was passed by yeas 42, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            RAILROADS AND OUR TROOPS.
                            Mr. MILLER offered the following concurrent resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved by the Senate (the House of
                                                Representatives concurring), That in
                                            consideration of the liberal franchise heretofore
                                            grained by the State to the several railroad companies
                                            within her limits and the ample protection to property
                                            at all times received to such corporations by the power
                                            of the State, it is declared to be the opinion of the
                                            Legislature of Indiana that such railroad companies as
                                            have carried, or may during this year carry, volunteer
                                            troops of the State to the Capital or any other place of
                                            rendezvous, and the discharged men from thence to their
                                            homes, should not require payment from the State for
                                            such service, It being no more than the proper share of
                                            such companies of the burden imposed upon the people of
                                            Indiana by the exigencies of the times; but for the
                                            transportation of the organized forces of the State, or
                                            of the Unified States, from place to place over their
                                            roads, such railroad companies should be paid a
                                            reasonable compensation for their service, not exceeding
                                            two cents per mile for passengers, and for freight not
                                            exceeding two-thirds the usual rates.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. LINE moved to amend by adding the following:
                            "And that a copy of these concurrent resolutions be forwarded to the
                                President of each railroad in this State, or passing through the
                                same."
                            Mr. MURRAY moved to strike out all in the resolution having reference
                                to pay, the words "two-thirds," and insert in lieu thereof the words
                                "one-half."
                            And then came the recess till 2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            On motion by Mr. CLAYPOOL, the Senate took from the table the
                                concurrent resolution for a recess from this day to the 21st inst.,
                                with the pending amendment (Mr. Wolfe's) proposing to adjourn the
                                session sine die next Monday.
                            On the further motion of Mr. CLAYPOOL, the amendment was laid on the
                                table.
                            Mr. BEESON moved to reconsider the vote just taken.
                            On motion by Mr. STUDABAKER - yeas 23, nays 17 - his motion to
                                reconsider was laid on the table.
                            On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, the resolution was amended by striking out
                                the "19th" and inserting the "11th" inst.
                            The amendment as amended was then adopted.

                            
                                DEFINING TREASON.
                                The House amendments to Senator Beeson's treason bill [2] was

                                            investigate the Commissary Department are hereby
                                            authorized and empowered to send for persons and papers,
                                            and to examine such persons under oath as they may deem
                                            necessary for a full investigation of the Commissary
                                            Department. And that said committee are hereby further
                                            authorized and empowered to inquire into and examine the
                                            purchase of provisions and supplies for the troops
                                            supplied by said Commissary Department.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            SUPPORT OF VOLUNTEER FAMILIES.
                            On the motion of Mr. VEATCH, the volunteer home supply bill (36) was
                                taken from the table, it being on the second reading.
                            Mr. Veatch submitted amendments, viz.:
                            "Strike out of the first section all that relates to the "union of
                                the States," and insert: "For the purchase of arms and equipments
                                for the raising and maintaining of military companies within their
                                respective jurisdictions, either for home defense or for the service
                                of the State or of the United States, or for any other purpose
                                necessary for the defense of their respective counties, cities and
                                towns."
                            Amend the second section by striking all out after the word "for," in
                                the 5th line, and inserting: "Any of the purposes aforesaid."
                            He said the point was, that the legalizing clause in the bill did not
                                cover the appropriations made by the cities, &c., for arms. The
                                amendment covers all appropriations contemplated in the first
                                section. He proposed to amend further:
                            SEC. 3. That said Boards of Commissioners and corporate authorities
                                of cities and towns are hereby authorized to levy each year a
                                special tax on the taxable property and polls within their
                                jurisdiction, respectively, for the purpose of paying such
                                appropriations or the interest thereon.
                            These amendments were severally adopted.
                            The bill was then ordered to the third reading as amended, read the
                                third time, and passed - yeas 69, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            TREASON - ITS PUNISHMENT.
                            Mr. BUNDY submitted an order, that the Governor be requested to
                                return to this House the treason bill, the Senate enrolled act No.
                                2. He had been informed that there is language in that bill that
                                must be modified, or the Governor will be constrained to veto it. It
                                was at the request of a Senator that he made the motion.
                            The order was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            NORTHERN PRISON REPORT.
                            Mr. JENKINSON submitted an order, which was adopted, that the
                                    Committee on Printing inquire into the reason
                                why members of the House have not been furnished with the report of
                                the Committee for the Investigation of the Affairs of the
                                    Northern State Prison.
                        
                        
                            DEPUTIES FOR OFFICIAL VOLUNTEERS.
                            Mr. VEATCH, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                returned the Deputy bill, [S.
                                    8] providing for the appointment of deputies by public
                                officers who have entered the military service the Committee
                                recommending its passage.
                            After debate, in which constitutional objections were urged by Mr.
                                Black, Mr. Robbins and others - from which it appeared that the bill
                                was to meet the special case of Col. Dumont, President of the Board
                                of Commissioners of the Sinking Fund, now in the U. S. military
                                service - the bill was put upon its passage on the third reading,
                                and failed - yeas 42, nays 39 - for want of a constitutional
                                majority.
                        
                        
                            INDIANA UNIVERSITY.
                            On motion by Mr. McLEAN, the University  bill [S.19] was taken up and passed
                                the first reading.
                            Mr. McLEAN. I move that the rules be suspended, and the bill read the
                                second time now. The same bill passed both Houses, he said, at the
                                last session, but through some informality, failed to become a
                                law.
                            The SPEAKER. The informality to which the gentleman refers was, that
                                the presiding officers of the Senate and House failed to sign the
                                bill. It was not presented to them by the Clerk.
                            The rules and constitutional provision were suspended, and the bill
                                was read the second time by title, and considered on the second
                                reading.
                            Mr. McLEAN moved that it be put on the final passage.
                            Mr. BLACK. Would the bill devolve any expense on the State, by making
                                the Geologist a member of the Faculty?
                            Mr. McLEAN. No. The object was to make the University the depository
                                of all geological and mineralogical specimens.
                            Mr. WOODHULL objected to the book clause.
                            Mr. BUNDY - to the removal of the geological cabinet from this city.
                                It belonged to the Agricultural society.
                            Mr. McLEAN It don't propose to remove the cabinet.
                            The bill was passed the final reading - yeas 78, nays 0. It
                                authorizes $1,000 of the proceeds of the University land to be
                                expended under the direction of Prof. T. A. Wiley for enlarging the
                                cabinet of the University, and authorizes the State Librarian to
                                transfer to the University Library complete sets of the journals and
                                documents of the two Houses and those received from other States of
                                which there are duplicates now in the State Library, or which may be
                                here after received; and makes the State Geologist (Dr. Richard Dale
                                Owen,) a member of the faculty of the University.
                        
                        
                            TREASON - ITS PUNISHMENT.
                            On motion of Mr. BUNDY, the treason bill [S. 2,] just returned by
                                message from the Governor, was taken up, and by reconsideration,
                                amended by striking out the word "without" [the State] and by
                                substituting this clause: "When the overt act of treason shall have
                                been commenced in this State and consummated within the limits of
                                another State or Territory, the person charged therewith maybe
                                arrested, tried and convicted in this State."
                            Mr. McLEAN doubted whether that was constitutional. The Constitution
                                says expressly, "in the county where the offense has been
                                committed." The word "committed," not "commenced," is used in the
                                Constitution.
                            Mr. BUNDY. The decisions in all the courts, were, that where an act
                                has been commenced in one jurisdiction you may convict in the
                                jurisdiction where the act was consummated. This is a provision, at
                                least, which the Governor is willing to sign.
                            The bill was then again passed to the final reading - yeas 76, nays
                                2.
                        
                        
                            HOME GUARDS.
                            Mr. GRESHAM introduced a bill [37] entitled an act to establish Home
                                Guards in cities and other municipal corporations and in
                                counties.
                            Its object was understood to be to authorize arms of the State to be
                                furnished to companies constituted of men over 45 years of age.
                            The bill was read twice, (under a dispensation,) and referred to the
                                    Committee on Military Affairs.
                        
                        
                            TRUST FUNDS AND SWAMP LAND FUNDS.
                            Mr. BINGHAM, from the Committee on Ways and Means,
                                reported, in accordance with the request of the Auditor of State, a
                                bill [38] entitled an act providing for the management of the
                                various trust funds belonging to or held by the State of
                                Indiana.
                            He said the Auditor had reported that some doubt exists as to whether
                                the embezzlement bill of the last session will not embarrass the
                                disbursement of the trust fund, including the swamp land fund. So
                                the bill provides that the embezzlement bill "shall not be construed
                                so as in any manner to interfere with the management and
                                disbursement of the trust funds."
                            On Mr. B.'s motion the bill was read twice, (under a dispensation,)
                                and considered on the second reading and engrossment.
                            Mr. BLACK proposed to amend by inserting, appropriately, these words:
                                "or funds in the hands of the county Treasurers." Some county
                                Treasurers think the embezzlement bill applying to them and there is
                                trouble among them to know what they ought to do.
                            Mr. CRAIN. I am satisfied that that amendment should not
                                be made. This bill has been got up for an express purpose. If the
                                county treasurers do not understand the business, let them resign
                                and give place to those that do. I move to lay the amendment on the
                                table.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. FISHER. The law authorizes the Auditor of State to loan certain
                                trust funds on security. The law also makes provision for his paying
                                out the money which stands on his books upon orders on account of
                                ditching swamp lands. The embezzlement bill provides that no money
                                shall be paid out of the treasury except upon special appropriation.
                                And as there is no knowing either the amount of the trust funds that
                                will be loaned, or the amount that will be needed for ditching, we
                                can not make these special appropriations. This bill is to cure that
                                defect in the law, so that the Auditor may loan and pay out these
                                funds in such cases, and the embezzlement bill shall be in operative
                                upon him.
                            Mr. CRAIN. I suppose that the Legislature thought the embezzlement
                                bill would never interfere with the trust funds. Certainly we cannot
                                know how to appropriate this money. There are counties whose funds
                                are in the office of the Treasurer of State. They are doing jobs of
                                ditching, and under the law they should be paid for their work. But
                                we can not tell beforehand how much they will require. Suppose we
                                were to attempt to appropriate, we would have to say. "All the money
                                belonging to the county, or so much thereof as may be necessary,"
                                &c. I do not think that the Legislature intended that the
                                embezzlement bill should apply to the trust funds. As to the
                                amendment, the county Treasurers understand that they can not loan
                                the State funds, and that is what I want them to understand.
                            Mr. NEBEKER. There is still a difficulty

                        INDIANAPOLIS, MAY 20, 1861.
                        NO. 8.
                    
                    
                        
                            about this. It will open the door to fraud to some extent; but I do
                                not know any way to prevent it. I must vote for the bill, because
                                the funds must be loaned. I would like to close the doors as to the
                                swamp land fund; but the act of Congress is imperative, that the
                                money shall go for ditching. I know no better way than to pass the
                                bill, but I regret the necessity.
                            The bill was then ordered to be engrossed, considered as engrossed,
                                ordered to the third reading, read the third time and passed the
                                House of Representatives - yeas 48, nays 8.
                        
                        
                            INDIANA REPORTS.
                            The Speaker laid before the House a letter from Gordon Tanner, late
                                Reporter to the Supreme Court, with reference to the distribution of
                                the current volumes of the Indiana Reports belong to the State, and
                                as to what is due from the State to Merrill & Co., on account of
                                which the Reports are withheld by them.
                            On motion by Mr. BUNDY, the letter was referred to the
                                    Committee on Ways and Means.
                            On motion by Mr. HOLCOMB, it was ordered that Messrs. Carson and
                                Kendrick be added to the special committee to investigate the books
                                of the Adjutant General.
                            The House then took a recess till two o'clock P.M.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            Mr. SHERMAN submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the committee appointed
                                            by the House to examine the kind and quality of
                                            provisions furnished at Camp Morton be instructed to
                                            inquire into the management of the Quartermaster's
                                            department, the price paid for such articles as are
                                            furnished by direction of the Quartermaster-General; the
                                            quality of the same, and whether purchased by public or
                                            private contract; and such other matters touching the
                                            management of said department as they in their judgment
                                            may deem advisable, and that said committee have leave
                                            to sit during the recess of the Legislature.
                                    
                                
                            

                            
                                CONTRABAND SHIPMENTS.
                                The concurrent resolution of the Senate for a joint special
                                    committee of three on the part of the House to confer with the
                                    United States District Attorney and the United States Marshal
                                    for the State as to the extent of the power of those officers to
                                    prevent shipments to the South of articles contraband of war,
                                    and report, &c., was taken up and concurred in.
                            
                            
                                ARMS IN THE COUNTIES.
                                Mr. BLACK submitted the following, which was adopted:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the
                                                  Committee on Military Affairs
                                                be instructed to inquire into the expediency of
                                                repealing the law passed at the last session of this
                                                Legislature, requiring the Governor to collect to
                                                this place all arms distributed among the several
                                                counties of this State.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                VOLUNTEER'S DEPUTY BILL.
                                On motion of Mr. McLEAN, the Deputy bill [S.8] which failed this
                                    morning for want of a constitutional vote, was again taken
                                    up.
                                He said the constitutional objection to the bill was in that
                                    clause which forbids the holding of two lucrative offices at the
                                    same time by the same person. But this could not apply to Col.
                                    Dumont, for he was in the service of the United States, and that
                                    but for three months; so technically he received no annual
                                    salary from that source. It was not an office under the Federal
                                    Government that he held. It was simply a call on the Indiana
                                    militia to serve the United States three months, and could not
                                    come within the purview of this clause of the Constitution.
                                    There was the example of a Colonel in the Mexican war and a
                                    member of Congress in the same person at the same time. There
                                    was a gentleman in Bartholomew county who was clerk of the
                                    county and a Captain in the Mexican invasion; and the present
                                    distinguished Senator from Oregon was now a Brigadier-General
                                    under the appointment of Mr. Lincoln.
                                Mr. DOBBINS said his principal objection to the bill was his
                                    aversion to giving too many offices to one man. Not that Col.
                                    Dumont would not serve well, nor that he had not served to the
                                    utmost satisfaction in whatever position he had been placed. If
                                    he could not well perform the duties of both the places he now
                                    holds he would say, let him resign one.
                                Mr. BUNDY. The constitutional point was "No person holding a
                                    lucrative office or appointment under the laws of the United
                                    States or of this State." The question was, is he holding a
                                    lucrative office. He insisted that the objection taken this
                                    morning was well taken.
                                Mr. CRAIN. "No person holding a lucrative office or appointment
                                    under the laws of the United States, or of this State, shall be
                                    eligible to a seat in the General Assembly." That is the way the
                                    Constitution reads. If the Constitution read that such a person
                                    should not be eligible to any office, then there could be no
                                    question about its applicability here. But it does not. It only
                                    fixes that no member of the Legislature shall hold a lucrative
                                    office. But Col. Dumont was ia the service of the United States,
                                    and so was not affected by the provision, any more than a
                                    judicial officer would be affected by his election to the
                                    Congress of the United States. He did not care how many offices
                                    a man holds, if he is the 
                                    man for the position. He had always understood that Col. Dumont
                                    had managed the sinking fund well. Col. Dumont, he believed, was
                                    a Democrat, when there used to be Democrats, but Republicans
                                    always voted for him because he was qualified. He did not know
                                    Col. D. personally, but from his reputation he was willing he
                                    should stay in his position. According to his experience it was
                                    a hard thing to get men to fill offices right.
                                Mr. WOODHULL read the constitutional provision, and declared the
                                    conclusion that no person could hold two lucrative offices,
                                    "unless as in this Constitution otherwise specifically provided"
                                    Col. Dumont was appointed under the military authority of the
                                    State; and he showed the provision in those cases. But then, as
                                    there was no annual salary, he could not see the slightest
                                    constitutional objection to his holding on. Col. Durnont had not
                                    gone into the service of the United States for the pittance of
                                    the pay. It was the impulse of patriotism. He would be opposed
                                    to giving the Colonel's civil office to any man whose want of
                                    patriotism would allow him to take it, and so deprive the State
                                    of an efficient and valuable officer.
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN. (Mr. Sherman in the Chair.) If the bill be
                                    unconstitutional the House should not pass it; if not, I see no
                                    reason why the House should reject it. If it be unconstitutional
                                    it is so upon the ground of the same individual 'holding two
                                    lucrative offices or appointments. Our constitution has one
                                    exception, and that is the officers of the militia. Gentlemen
                                    seem to speak of Col. Dumont as in the United States army. He is
                                    not in the United States army, but with the Indiana militia. He
                                    has been called into the field by virtue of a provision of the
                                    constitution of the United States and of the act of Congress of
                                    1795, through the proclamation of the President of the United
                                    States, calling out the militia of the different States for the
                                    purpose of-preventing or quelling insurrection. And pursuant to
                                    the proclamation of the President of the United States and in
                                    virtue of the act of Congress in 1795 the militia of the State
                                    of Indiana are now in the field, and Col. Dumont is in one of
                                    the regiments; and he is therefore clearly within the exception.
                                    I understand some gentlemen object to the passage of the bill
                                    for the reason that there is no restriction upon the deputies. I
                                    call the attention of such gentlemen to the third section. It
                                    provides that the deputies by this act authorized shall take the
                                    oath prescribed for their principals, shall be subject to the
                                    same penalties, and shall also file the same official bonds.
                                    Here there is ample protection against unauthorized and illegal
                                    action. Now then there is another law which doubles their
                                    security, because the principal is liable for the acts of his
                                    deputy; hence the security of the principal is likewise doubled.
                                    Now if I am correct as to the constitutional provision, and if
                                    Col. Dumont is in the Indiana militia, there is no foundation as
                                    to the constitutional objection; and if he is not in the Indiana
                                    militia then Camp Morton is filled with soldiers under no
                                    authority of law whatever. I do hope the bill will pass. I have
                                    but a slight acquaintance with Col. Dumont. I know he is reputed
                                    as a good civil officer; and I have heard that he is also a good
                                    military officer. He has tendered his services to the State and
                                    through the State to the General Govern merit for the purpose of
                                    upholding the laws and preserving the Union. It is on that
                                    account, principally, that I feel solicitious for passage of
                                    this bill; so as to leave him in the field - for battle if
                                    necessary - in command of the regiment over which he has been
                                    appointed. And I think that when a gentleman like Col. Dumont
                                    goes into the service under such circumstances- not for the mere
                                    salary involved and it becomes necessary for the Legislature of
                                    his State to pass a law by which the duties of his civil office
                                    mat be discharged in his absence, it should do so without a
                                    moments hesitation.
                                Mr. RAGAN. It had been said that we have men that will fill the
                                    place of Col. Dumont in the board of Sinking Fund Commissioners.
                                    He hoped that there was not a man mean enough to do such a thing
                                    in the State of Indiana. He would do anything that was lawful to
                                    keep Col. Dumont in his civil position.
                                Mr. BUNDY (interrupting) disclaimed the use of any such
                                    language.
                                Mr. RAGAN did not wish to place any man in a false position. We
                                    ought to encourage men who are willing to lay down their lives
                                    for their country. The constitution provided for this case all
                                    over, and he hoped the law would be passed without a dissenting
                                    voice. We ought to encourage such men - thank God we have them.
                                    He would not put a straw in the way of a willing to volunteer in
                                    such a time like this - willing, like Col. Dumont, to take his
                                    life in his hand and imperil everything tor the defense his
                                    country. The House should offer every encouragement for this
                                    feeling, and show by its action now that this Legislature is
                                    willing to double the salary of such a man rather than ask him
                                    give up the office he has.
                                Mr. FORD demanded the previous question and, under its force, the
                                    vote was again taken the bill and reported - yeas 60, nays 23 -

                                Mr. FISHER submitted a joint resolution, entitled "A joint
                                    resolution in regard to the settlement in the Bank Department in
                                    the Auditor's office in regard to the claim against May, Drake
                                    and Bright," It is as follows:
                                WHEREAS, It appears by a communication from the Auditor of State
                                    to the House of Representatives, that May, Drake and Bright
                                    became indebted to the Bank Department of the Auditor's office;
                                    that in 1859, by a resolution, a committee consisting of J. T.
                                    Elliott. William T. Otto and Norman Eddy, was appointed to
                                    settle and adjust this among other matters; that said committee
                                    settled said claim by taking land therefor, and upon filing the
                                    report the Auditor of State drew his warrant on the Treasurer
                                    for the sum of $10,000, which warrant has not been paid:
                                AND WHEREAS, The State in appointing said committee was acting in
                                    the capacity of trustee, and did not assume the payment of said
                                    claim: Therefore,

                                                payment of the said $10,000, or any part thereof,
                                                until the money is received from the sale of the
                                                land taken of May, Drake and Bright in satisfaction
                                                of the claim against them.

                                    absence for committee session.
                                On motion of Mr. GRAIN, the Senate amendments to Mr. Fisher's
                                    loan commissioners bill (22) were taken up and concurred in.
                                All the amendments of the Senate (heretofore recited in these
                                    Reports) were concurred in, except the third - that amending the
                                    fifth section, changing and inserting two clauses: 1.
                                    Appropriating the last winter's 2 1/2 cents sinking fund tax on
                                    each hundred dollars' worth of taxable property to pay the
                                    interest on the two million loan. 2. Striking out the five cents
                                    tax in the bill, and inserting "two and a half"so making five
                                    cents tax to pay the said interest.
                                These two clauses were rejected after full debate by Messrs.
                                    Fisher, Grain, Bundy and others for the rejection, and Messrs.
                                    Lane, Atkinson, Brett and others for concurrence. So it was

                                Mr. VEATCH, from the select committee on Penitentiary
                                        bills, reported a bill [39] entitled an act to
                                    authorize the removal of prisoners from the Southern to the
                                    Northern Prison, and provide tor the employment of said

                                It provides for transporting two hundred prisoners to the

                                    direct the employment of any number of convicts in the

                                    Directors may hire them to labor and take payment in articles
                                    that may be used for State defense, or they may be employed in
                                    the manufacture of articles that will meet with ready sale; that
                                    the Superintendent of the Northern Prison may employ a competent
                                    mechanic to superintend the work and construction of said
                                    Prison, at a price not exceeding three dollars per day. And it
                                    appropriates thousand dollars for 1861, and thousand dollars for
                                    1862 for each Prison.
                                It was passed to the second reading.
                            
                            
                                NEWSPAPERS.
                                On motion by Mr. DAVIS, it was
                                Ordered, That the Doorkeeper he directed to
                                    have the newspapers ordered by the House stopped during the
                                    recess of the session.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON submitted an order, that the Secretary of State be
                                    authorized to have the militia law of the present session
                                    published in the Indiana State Journal and the
                                        Indiana State Sentinel.
                                Mr. VEATCH. That has once been voted down.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON. A great many are inquiring after that law, and it
                                    will cost about twenty-five dollars to print it in this way. It
                                    is a matter of interest to every man in the State.
                                Mr. McLEAN knew something about the price paid for advertising in
                                    this way, having been once connected with a newspaper, and it
                                    would cost, by "the square" about two hundred dollars. The price
                                    of setting the type alone would be thirty cents a square.
                                Mr. BUNDY. The point of the gentleman from Spencer was well
                                    taken. The resolution was not before the House. But to get rid
                                    of it, he would move to lay it on the table.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                                Here the House took a recess till 8 o'clock, P.M.
                            
                        
                        
                            NIGHT SESSION.
                            The House met at 8 o'clock, P. M.
                            A message from the Senate, by Mr. Brown, their Secretary, announced
                                the action of that body on sundry bills, and the passage of Mr.
                                Miller's joint resolutions.

                            
                                NATIONAL EXIGENCY.
                                Mr. JONES of Tippecanoe submitted a joint resolution relative to
                                    the exigency of the times; instructing Senators and
                                    Representatives in Congress.
                                It was made a concurrent resolution, and is as follows:
                                WHEREAS, The doctrine of the right of instruction has not been
                                    questioned as a fundamental principle of a free and
                                    representative government; AND WHEREAS, the government of the
                                    United States has been forced to accept  the dire necessity of putting down
                                    treason and rebellion in the United States by force of arms; AND
                                    WHEREAS, the views of our Senators and Representatives in
                                    Congress on the question of voting men and money for the purpose
                                    of enabling the Executive Department of the Government of the
                                    United States to prosecute the present lamentable war to a
                                    speedy and triumphant conclusion; therefore,
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Be it resolved by the General Assembly
                                                  of the State of Indiana, (the Senate
                                                concurring therein,) That our Senators in Congress
                                                be hereby instructed, and our Representatives in
                                                Congress be hereby recommended and requested to,
                                                immediately on the assembling of Congress, enact
                                                such measures as will enable the government to
                                                prosecute the present war which has been forced upon
                                                the government by rebels and traitors to a speedy,
                                                honorable and triumphant termination.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            And be it further resolved, That if
                                                either of our Senators or any Representative in
                                                Congress feels disinclined to give his support to
                                                such measures as may be necessary to put down
                                                treason and rebellion by force and arms, such
                                                Senator or Representative is hereby requested to
                                                resign said office and let the people of the
                                                district or State, as the case may be, fill their
                                                places with such men as will support the government
                                                and maintain the integrity and pepetuity of the
                                                Union against all our foes, whether without or
                                                within.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. DAVIS. It seems to me that the word "war" is made use of in
                                    these resolutions in several places where it ought to be
                                    "rebellion." I think that word ought to be stricken out; for I
                                    understand that Congress has not the power to declare war; and
                                    until Congress shall declare war it must be rebellion.
                                Mr. GRESHAM. We shall be here again before long, and to avoid
                                    hasty action on such a subject, I would suggest the propriety of
                                    laying the resolutions over till after the recess.
                                Mr. BUNDY. I more that the resolutions be made the special order
                                    for Thursday, the 23d inst.
                                Mr. JONES of Tippecanoe. I presume there is hardly a quorum here
                                    to-night, and as it may be necessary to change the phraseology,
                                    I would suggest that the resolution go a select committee of
                                    three.
                                The latter motion was agreed to. The committee subsequently
                                    announced is: Messrs. Jones of Tippecanoe, Roberts and
                                    Bingham.
                            
                            
                                NEW JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.
                                Mr. COLLINS of Whitley introduced a bill [40] to create the
                                    judicial circuit; to provide for the election of a judge and
                                    prosecuting attorney therein, and to fix the time of holding
                                    courts therein. [The new circuit is composed of the counties of
                                    Lagrange, Steuben, Noble, and Allen.]
                                The bill was passed to the second reading.
                            
                            
                                TIPPECANOE RESOLUTIONS.
                                Mr. BINGHAM, from the Committee on Military
                                        Affairs, reported back the proceedings of a
                                    meeting of the people of Tippecanoe, held last Saturday, - the
                                    committee stating that the desire of the said meeting, so
                                    patriotically expressed in their resolutions, with reference to
                                    raising men and appropriating money, had been already provided
                                    for in good time and ample manner, and suggested to them a due
                                    regard for the good old maxim: "Be slow to anger and of great
                                    kindness;" they reported a motion to lay the proceedings and
                                    resolutions on the table.
                                The report was concurred in.
                                The Senate amendments to Mr. Gore's common pleas bill [18] just reported by
                                    message, coming up -
                                On motion by Mr, ORR, it was concurred in.
                                The Senate amendments to the House amendments to the treason
                                    bill, [S. 2] viz: Striking out the word "arrested," and then in
                                    another place inserting these words, "treasonable act charge
                                    shall have been commenced and committed," - were concurred
                                    in.
                                Mr. Miller's joint resolution heretofore reported by message from
                                    the Senate was also taken un and concurred in.
                                Mr. GRESHAM, from the Committee on Military
                                        Affairs, returned the bill [H. 7] with amendments,
                                    filling the blanks in section five and six with the word
                                    "five."
                                The amendments were concurred in; and so the bill was ordered to
                                    be engrossed. - The Senate amendments to the joint resolution of
                                    the House ot Representatives, with reference to the claim of the
                                    State against May, Drake and Bright, was taken up and concurred
                                    in it being a change from a joint resolution to a concurrent
                                    resolution.
                                And then the House adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.NIGHT SESSION.
                        
                            FRIDAY, May 10, 1861.
                        
                        The PRESIDENT called the Senate to order at 8 o'clock.
                        
                            HON. JESSE D. BRIGHT.
                            M. JONES offered the following, which adopted by consent:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Federal Relations instructed to inquire
                                            and report at an early day whether Jesse D. Bright, one
                                            of our United States Senators, is a citizen of the State
                                            of Indiana; and further, whether can and will represent
                                            the people of the State of Indiana in the United States
                                            Senate truly and fully in present crisis; and further,
                                            whether his present position the questions now
                                            engrossing public attention does not render his further
                                            continuance in the Senate of the United States
                                            inconsistent with the public interest and public

                        The Senate met at 9 o'clock.
                        On motion of MR. LINE, the reading of the Journal was dispensed with.
                        A message from the Governor announced the approval and signature of

                            ADJUTANT GENERAL'S REPORT.
                            The PRESIDENT laid before the Senate the following report from the
                                Adjutant General:
                            
                                To the Senate of the State of Indiana:
                            
                            Agreeably to a resolution of your honorable body passed on the 10th
                                inst., the undersigned respectfully reports as follows:
                            Pursuant to the order of His Excellency, the Governor, five Regiments
                                of Infantry, embracing the first fifty companies tendered, have been
                                formed and ordered into camp, m the order hereto appended.
                            Inasmuch as the companies were tendered for the three months call, it
                                became necessary to ascertain those which would offer for twelve
                                months service for the State. A Part, of many of the companies
                                declined to engage for twelve months service, and the Captains were
                                given time to recruit. Until that time expires it cannot be
                                determined whether all will respond to the order.
                            It was deemed best not to publish the order forming the Regiments
                                until the companies composing them had all accepted.
                            After the formation of the five Regiments, there remained in Camp
                                Morton and Sullivan, six companies, a part of which it is said have
                                disbanded and returned to their homes. The others remain awaiting
                                the decision of His Excellency the Governor, relative to the
                                additional regiment under the bill.

                                            inquire when the companies composing the five regiments
                                            were organized, the date of the officers' commissions,
                                            and the filing of the Muster Roll in the office of the
                                            Adjutant General, when tendered and when accepted; also
                                            in what order additional companies have been tendered
                                            for future service.
                                    
                                
                            
                            On a motion to adjourn by Senator LINE.
                            The PRESIDENT declared the Senate adjourned until Tuesday, May the
                                21st, at 2 o'clock.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            SATURDAY, May 11, 1861.
                        
                        The House met at 9 o'clock.
                        The reading of the journal of yesterday having been dispensed with -
                        A message from the Governor, by Mr. Holloway, his private Secretary,
                            announced his approval and signature of the Militia bill, the enrolled
                            act of the House, No. 21.
                        
                            COMMISSARY AND QUARTERMASTER'S DEPARTMENTS.
                            Mr. CHAPMAN. Mr. Speaker - I have been placed on a Select Committee
                                that is to act during the vacation. I desire to be excused from
                                serving on that Committee. It is impossible for me to stay. It is
                                the Committee of Investigation of the Commissary and
                                    Quartermaster's Departments.
                            On motion by Mr. FISHER, it was ordered that Mr Parrett take the
                                place of Mr. Chapman on said Committee.
                        
                        
                            PERSONAL EXPLANATION.
                            Mr. PARRETT. I rise to a question of personal privilege. ["Consent,"
                                "consent."] I perceive by an article in the Indianapolis Journal of this morning, that I am represented
                                yesterday as having been ill-tempered - in a bad humor. That is not
                                so. I am never in a bad humor. [Laughter.] I perceive that either
                                the reporter or the editor of the Journal has
                                misapprehended what I said this morning; for that paper says: "Mr.
                                Parrett, of Lagrange, indulged yesterday in some ill-natured sneers
                                at the honesty and faithfulness of the Public Printer." I did not do
                                any such thing. It is known, I suppose, that I voted last winter
                                against having any public printer, and I voted to reduce his pay.
                                But when we determined to have a public printer I voted for the
                                editor of the Journal to be that officer. So there
                                is nothing personal between us that calls for anything from him!
                                What I said yesterday was this: "That the documents which the House
                                ordered to be printed were not sent in here, as a general thing, as
                                faithfully as they were sent into the other branch of the
                                Legislature." The reason I said I did not know; nor do I know now. I
                                was speaking of the resolution of enquiry into the reason why this
                                was so. As I said before, there is a mistake. I know not but that
                                the public printer is honest and faithful. There was one remark I
                                made about publishing the laws, which the editor says I know nothing
                                about. It is true I know very little about that; but. I wanted to
                                know whether it is all right. I wanted to see that it was all right.
                                But I take this occasion to state that I impugned neither the public
                                printer's good faith or his honesty. I only wanted to call the
                                attention of the House (and that was perhaps a work of
                                supererogation) to the fact that we did not get our documents in
                                good time. And some of the bills come to other members' tables which
                                do not reach mine. That was the extent of my remarks. I have the
                                highest respect, sir, for the public printer; he need not say that I
                                "broke a hole through the truth." I think, sir, when the Journal charges members in this mariner, that it
                                should itself take care not to "break a hole through the truth."
                                [Laughter.]
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair would say to the gentleman from Elkhart and
                                Lagrange that perhaps the best way for him to get along with the
                                matter would be to go down and thrash the editor of the Journal. [Laughter.] The Chair will appoint the gentleman
                                a committee of one to do it.
                            Mr. KENDRICK rose to a question of privilege upon the Journal reporter, for reciting a humorous resolution
                                introduced yesterday, directing the reference of matter to the
                                    committee on the affairs of the town of
                                    Indianapolis, in order that the clever chairman
                                thereof might have something to do.
                            The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Marion, then, be kind enough to
                                accompany the gentleman from Elkhart and Lagrange on his fighting
                                expedition? [Laughter.]
                            Mr. KENDRICK. I do not want to fight.
                            The SPEAKER. The two gentlemen can go down together, and after the
                                gentleman from Elkhart and Lagrange shall have done the thrashing,
                                the gentleman from Marion can talk to him. [Laughter.]
                            Mr. CASON. I propose that the gentleman from Marion act as surgeon in
                                the case. [Continued laughter.]
                            Mr. KENDRICK. I have no doubt that I might be able to thrash the
                                editor of the Journal, but -
                            The SPEAKER. No. It wouldn't do have him thrashed twice the same
                                day.
                            So the subject was dropped.
                            Mr. HAYS asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill [41] to amend
                                the first section of the act prescribing the duties of the Auditor
                                of State, approved May 2, 1852, which was passed to the second
                                reading.
                        
                        
                            WORTHLESS BANK NOTES.
                            On motion by Mr. McLEAN, his bill [38] providing for stamping
                                counterfeit and worthless bank bills and prescribing the duty of the
                                Auditor of State in relation thereto, was taken up, read the second
                                time, and referred to the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary.
                        
                        
                            THE PENITENTIARY BILL.
                            On motion by Mr. FISHER, Mr. Veatch's penitentiary bill [H. R. 40]
                                was taken up and read the second time.
                            Mr. McLEAN proposed its engrossment.
                            Mr. FISHER. There are some blanks in the bill, and the estimates can
                                not be made now as to how they should be filled. When this body
                                shall meet again we will be better prepared to estimate the absolute
                                amounts that should be propriated.
                            On motion by Mr. McLEAN, the bill was referred to the
                                    Committee on Ways and Means.
                            Mr. FISHER. I'm informed that there will be no further message from
                                the Senate or Governor, to-day; and if there is no further business
                                before the House I would ask whether it would not be in order to
                                adjourn.
                            The SPEAKER. It would be in order if some gentleman would make the
                                motion.
                            Mr. FISHER. I move that the House now adjourn.
                            There being no objection -
                            The SPEAKER. This House stands adjouned till Tuesday the 21st inst.,
                                at the hour of 1 o'clock A. M.
                            So the House adjourned.
                        
                        
                        
                            Enrolled Act No. 21 of the House of
                                Representatives.
                            AN ACT for the organization and regulation of the Indiana militia;
                                prescribing penalties for violations of said regulations; providing
                                for the election and appointment of officers; defining the duty of
                                military and civil officers, and penalties for the neglect or
                                violation thereof ; providing for courts martial, councils of
                                administration and military encampments; making appropriations for
                                the support of said militia; repealing all laws heretofore enacted
                                on that subject, saving certain acts therein named; and declaring an
                                emergency for the immediate taking effect thereof.
                            SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the
                                    State of Indiana, That the militia shall be divided into
                                two classes:
                            First. Sedentary.
                            Second. Active.
                            
                                OF THE SEDENTARY MILITIA.
                                SEC. 2. The sedentary militia shall consist of all white male
                                    persons subject to bear arms under the constitution of Indiana,
                                    who do not belong to the active militia.
                            
                            
                                OF THE ACTIVE MILITIA.
                                SEC. 3. The active militia shall consist of able bodied white
                                    male persons, between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years,
                                    who shall be enrolled members of armed and uniformed companies,
                                    duly organized and mustered into the service of the State,
                                    according to the provisions of this act.
                                SEC. 4. All county auditors, assessors, sheriffs, or other civil
                                    officers, upon whom are devolved the discharge of specific
                                    duties under this act, who shall neglect or refuse to obey the
                                    provisions of the law herein specified, shall forfeit and pay
                                    not more than five hundred nor less than twenty dollars for each
                                    and every offense, to be recovered in any court of competent
                                    jurisdiction, for the use of the military fund of the State, in
                                    an action by the State, on the relation of any commissioned
                                    office in the county.
                            
                            
                                OF THE MILITARY FUND.
                                SEC. 5. One fourth part of the military fund shall remain in the
                                    State treasury, and shall be drawn on the warrant of the
                                    Commander in Chief, to pay the salaries of the Adjutant General
                                    and Quartermaster General, and to pay the expenses of State and
                                    brigade encampments, and brigade courts martial, and such other
                                    expenses as may accrue in the procurement of blanks provided for
                                    in this act.
                                SEC. 6. The balance of the military fund shall forthwith be
                                    distributed, pro rata, by the Treasurer of
                                    State, among those counties having an active militia, in
                                    proportion to the number of active militia in each county, is
                                    shown by the Adjutant-General, which money shall be paid to the
                                    treasurers of said counties, and by them distributed as
                                    follows:

                                    December of each year. Performing the duty assigned in this
                                    section shall not excuse a regimental paymaster from the
                                    performance of any other duty that may appertrin to his

                                SEC. 55. All the fines assessed by brigade, division, and army
                                    corps courts martial shall go to and constitute a part of the
                                    fund of the brigade, division, or army corps, for which said
                                    courts may have been appointed. Said fund shall only be expended
                                    for objects connected strictly with the promotion of the
                                    discipline, instruction, and military efficiency of the troops
                                    to which said fund may appertain. But no expenditure shall be
                                    made except on warrants drawn by the commander of the troops to
                                    which the fund belongs, based on the specific resolves of the
                                    council of administration. The purchase of camp equipage, the
                                    purchase of subsistence for periods of encampment and
                                    instruction, and the hiring of transportation and music for such
                                    occasions will constitute legitimate objects of expenditure of
                                    these funds. The paymaster of each brigade, division, and army
                                    corps shall receive and disburse all  moneys appertaining to the fund of
                                    his corps, and shall render an account of the same to the
                                    commander of his corps, on the last day of April, August, and
                                    December of each year. Performing the duties assigned in this
                                    section shall not excuse any paymaster from performing any other
                                    duty appertaining to his office.

                                    commander, and only general courts martial shall have the power
                                    to take cognizance of capital cases.
                                SEC. 59. The proceedings of general courts martial shall be
                                    assimilated to the forms and modes of procedure directed for
                                    like courts by the "Rules and Articles of War," and the general

                                    same compensation for their attendance before courts martial, as
                                    is allowed by the law now in force for their attendance upon the
                                    civil courts of the State, recoverable from the accused if he be

                                made, that an opportunity will soon be given to them to aid the
                                State in her unexpected exigency, by offers to purchase any of the
                                Bonds to be issued under the late law providing for a loan to repel
                                invasion, and provide for public defense, which is herewith

                                that the purchasers of these Bonds will not need to hold them but a
                                brief period, and that a better investment of money cannot now be
                                made. Public notice will be given in the papers of this city, of the

                            TUESDAY, May 21, 1861.
                        
                        Pursuant to the adjournment of last Saturday-week, the PRESIDENT called
                            the Senate to order at 2 o'clock P. M.
                        Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. President - I move, that there be a call of the
                            Senate.
                        There being a second, the call was ordered and the following named
                            Senators appeared and answered to their names:
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Messrs. Beeson, Berry, Carnahan, Claypool, Cobb,
                                            Conley, Cravens of Jefferson, Culver, Hamilton, Hull,
                                            Johnston, Line, Lomax, March, Odell, Hay, Robinson,
                                            Shoulders, Stone, Teegarden, Williams, Wilson and Wolfe
                                            - 24.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        Pending the call-
                        Mr. TEEGARDEN moved that the absentees be sent for.
                        Mr. LINE, Consent. I know that there are five or six in the city.
                        Mr. CONLEY. Mr. Tarkington was here yesterday afternoon, and he told me
                            to state to the Senate that he was necessarily called home and hoped he
                            might be excused until he could come back.
                        SEVERAL SENATORS. "Consent," "Consent."
                        Mr. SHOULDERS. I was requested by Mr, Shields to inform the Senate that
                            his business was such that he could not come here till this evening. I
                            hope he will be excused.
                        SEVERAL SENATORS. "Consent," "Consent."
                        Mr. MARCH. I am told by a friend of Mr. Blair's that he was detained at
                            home and could not be here to-day, and requests that he might be
                            excused.
                        SEVERAL SENATORS. "Consent." "Consent." The PRESIDENT. The Senators are
                            excused.
                        The PRESIDENT directed the Secretary to furnish a list of the absentees
                            to the Doorkeeper.
                        Mr. STONE. I am satisfied we will not be able to get a quorum here this
                            evening, and I move that we adjourn.
                        There being a second, the PRESIDENT put the question, and decided the
                            motion rejected, according to the sound.
                        A division of the Senate being called for -
                        The motion was agreed to - affirmative 10, negative 8.
                        So the Senate adjourned.
                        Immediately upon the adjournment a message from the Governor announced
                            his approval and signature of Senator Beeson'a treason bill, S. No.
                            2.
                        Mr. O'Brien, the Senator from Dearborn, also appeared in the chamber.
                    
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            TUESDAY, May 21, 1861.
                        
                        The SPEAKER, in pursuance of the order of adjournment of the 11th of May,
                            resumed the extra session of April 24th, at the hour of nine o'clock
                            this morning, and there being no quorum present, it was ordered that the
                            House take a reccess till two o'clock P. M.
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The session resumed at two o'clock - Mr. McLEAN in the chair.
                            One the motion of Mr. BLACK, a call of the House was ordered and
                                proceeded - the Clerk still reporting - No quorum present - 58
                                Representatives responded to the call.
                            On motion by Mr. BUNDY, the House adjourned.
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            WEDNESDAY, May 22, 1861.
                        
                        On motion by Mr. LINE, further proceedings under the call pending at the
                            adjournment of yesterday were dispensed with.
                        
                            THE TIMES OF HOLDING THE COMMON PLEAS COURTS IN THE
                                COUNTIES OF ADAMS, WELLS, HUNTINGTON AND ALLEN.
                            Mr. SLACK introduced a bill [20] entitled An act to amend the twentieth section of an
                                act entitled "An act to fix the times of holding the Common Pleas
                                Courts in the several counties of this State; the duration of the
                                terms thereof; and making all process from the present Common Pleas
                                Courts returnable to such terms; and declaring when this act shall
                                take effect; and repealing all laws inconsistant therewith;"
                                approved March 5, 1859; which was read the third time.
                        
                        
                            THE LEGITIMATE BUSINESS OF THE SESSION.
                            The PRESIDENT. Unless the resolution adopted by the Senate on the
                                second clay of this session [printed on page 8 of the BREVIER
                                LEGISLATIVE REPORTS] is suspended or rescinded the Chair could not,
                                unless the Senate gives unanimous consent, entertain propositions of
                                a general character.
                            Mr. SLACK. Then I move the operation of that rule be suspended.
                            Mr. CONNER. Is this understood to be rescinding the rule
                                entirely?
                            The PRESIDENT. That is what the Chair understood it to be, in
                                effect.
                            Mr. CONNER. So far as I am concerned, I should not oppose suspending
                                the rule for a particular and pressing emergency, but to enter upon
                                general legislation, for one I shall go against it. I think it
                                unwise at this time. If it be proper to allow a particular bill to
                                be introduced by general consent without effecting the operation of
                                the resolution I, of course, could not object.
                            Mr. SLACK. I am not particular about rescinding that rule, but I
                                think by general consent the provisions of that rule might be
                                suspended. I do not think I should be in favor of going into a
                                general system of legislation, but the rule might be rescinded,
                                notwithstanding that.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER. It appears to be a strange process by which if
                                Senators desire any particular legislation they have to take their
                                bill's into the other end of the Capitol and get them passed there
                                in order to get them brought properly before this body. Some time
                                ago the gentleman from Delaware [Mr. March] introduced a bill fixing
                                the times of holding the Common Pleas Courts in his county, which
                                was ruled out here, but was introduced in the other end of the
                                Capitol, came back to the Senate and we passed it. Now it appears to
                                me we had better rescind this resolution than leave it in force; for
                                we have considered it discourteous to make it operate upon a bill
                                which has been passed in the other end of the Capitol.
                            Mr. CARNAHAN. I move to rescind the rule altogether.
                            Mr. WOLFE. I am opposed to rescinding the rule, for if it is done I
                                am satisfied matters of general legislation will be introduced to
                                such an extent as will necessarily prevent proper legislation in
                                regard to matters that will properly come before this body. We have
                                not time to do that, and I think there is more reason for the
                                continuation of the rule now than there was for adopting it at the
                                start. As far as the dispension of it for a special purpose that
                                will meet the approbation of the Senate generally, I have no
                                objection.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON. If this rule is to be suspended every time a bill is
                                introduced, it would save time to rescind it at once. I presume
                                every Senator here may have some business for which he may ask that
                                the rule be suspended; and if it is suspended for one man's benefit,
                                it ought to be suspended for all.
                            Mr. BEESON. I shall demand the ayes and noes on that question.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON. I will join the gentleman in his call for the ayes and
                                noes; for I would like to have an expression from this Senate as to
                                whether they will stay the forty days out or not. If we are going to
                                stay, we had just as well pass some bills that the people want
                                passed.
                            Mr. TURNER. I am in favor of rescinding the rule for the very reason
                                that some gentlemen are opposed to rescinding it. We are now drawing
                                rapidly to the close of the session, and I am satisfied there is no
                                disposition on the part of Senators to introduce a system of general
                                legislation. I do not know of any bills that are to be introduced,
                                and I apprehend there are but few. It looks like a kind of child's
                                play for the Senate to resolve that we will not go into a system of
                                general legislation, and then rescind the resolution.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I shall vote to rescind this rule in order to save our
                                own credit with the people of the State. The gentlemen who are
                                proposing to rescind this resolution are the same gentlemen who
                                voted to bring us back here. They said we had important business to
                                transact, and that it was necessary for this Legislature to convene
                                again. A majority carried this through, against my vote and the vote
                                of others on this floor. We are here now, and they propose by this
                                resolution to get off of legislation. Every one knows everything
                                pertaining to the war has been disposed of, The people up in our
                                section, when they asked, In the name of Heaven what  are we earning back here for? I could
                                say nothing, but that a majority of the Legislature thought we ought
                                to If we keep this rule over us, we might as well adjourn to-day,
                                and go home, and say to the people that we have no business. If

                                            distribution of the school revenue, and if the delay is
                                            occasioned by County Auditors failing to make reports as
                                            the law requires, to inform the Senate of the names of

                                        Resolved, That the Quartermaster

                                            been made.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            THE INTEREST LAW.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON offered a resolution instructing the
                                    Committee on Finance to inquire into the
                                expediency of repealing the law allowing a greater rate of interest
                                than six per cent, per annum, as allowed by an act of the General
                                Assembly of the regular session of 1861.
                            Mr. WOLFE. I cannot consent to vote for this resolution, for the
                                simple reason that if we repeal that law we will have no law on the
                                subject at all. I move to lay the resolution on the table.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON. It is simply a resolution of inquiry.
                            The resolution was laid on the table by yeas 26, nays 11.
                        
                        
                            QUALIFICATION OF VOTERS AT SCHOOL MEETINGS.
                            Mr. LINE offered a resolution "That the Committee on
                                    Education be instructed to inquire whether any further
                                legislation is necessary to define who are entitled to vote at the
                                regular or special school meetings held by the different schools of
                                the State."
                            Mr. MILLER. The passage of this resolution might seem to indicate
                                that there is some ambiguity in the law, which is not the case. It
                                is so plain and simple that anybody can understand it. I am opposed
                                to its passage for this reason.
                            
                            Mr. LINE. I have no desire to throw anything in by way of
                                embarrassment, to the carrying out of the school law, but I think it
                                necessary that there should be something definite as to who shall
                                vote at these meetings.
                            Mr. WOLFE. I think with the Senator from St. Joseph, (Mr. Miller,)
                                that there is not a great deal of need to define the law, but I
                                think the section is not as clear as it might be, though clear
                                enough. It seems to me, however, to be a fair subject of legislative
                                inquiry.
                            The resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            VACANCIES IN THE REGIMENTS OF VOLUNTEERS.
                            Mr. HULL offered a resolution "that the Committee on
                                    Military Affairs be instructed to enquire into the
                                necessity of making some provision whereby the Governor may have
                                power to fill vacancies that may occur in the volunteer regiments of
                                this State - for instance, when vacancies occur in the three years'
                                volunteer service by death or otherwise, the vacancies to be filled
                                by recruiting from this State, and report by bill or otherwise."He
                                said: I have been led to offer this resolution upon conversation
                                with Lieut. Davis, late of Fort Sumter, as to whether he would
                                accept an appoint as Colonel of a regiment of Indiana volunteers. He
                                said he would if any provision was made by which the regiment could
                                be kept full by volunteers from the State.
                            The resolution was rejected.
                        
                        
                            OMITTED APPROPRIATIONS.
                            On motion by Mr. LINE it was -
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Committee on

                                                there were in the general or specific appropriations
                                                of the last regular session any omissions that would
                                                prevent the State Government from being carried on

                                Mr. MURRAY. I wish to say to the Senate that it is absolutely
                                    necessary the Senate should remain in session until tickets for

                                    occasion demands. I hope the Senate will at least take a
                                    recess.
                                The motion was agreed to.

                            MARTIN COUNTY.
                            Mr. DOBBINS. Mr. Speaker - I ask the indulgence of the House to make
                                a brief statement of facts with reference to the present popular
                                excitement in Martin county. I wish to do this in justice to the
                                people of Martin county, and to myself and other members on this
                                floor. For some three or four weeks past, in the county of Martin,
                                the citizens have been constantly excited, in consequence of a band
                                of desperadoes in that region being formed partly in our county,
                                partly in Daviess county, and a majority of them in the county of
                                Knox - the organization extending also into the State of Illinois. I
                                will state, in justice to the gentleman from Daviess, (Mr. Brett)
                                that there is no great connection with the band in his county. But
                                they have a large connection in the county of Knox, and perhaps 60
                                in the State of Illinois, and the remainder, about 100, in the State
                                of Indiana. Five of these persons have been arrested in our county;
                                and for the purpose of arresting them, some of our citizens have
                                concluded to join the band - to go into it for the purpose of
                                developing its objects. And they have succeeded in finding out some
                                20 of them in the county of Knox, and have succeeded in bringing
                                three of them into our county. They then broke open the county
                                treasurer's house and succeeded in stealing $100. They were arrested
                                in one or two days afterwards. Report after report has gone out that
                                persons in the vicinity of the jail have determined to take them
                                out. These reports have excited our people and kept them in constant
                                fear for the last two or three weeks. Men that have stood high in
                                community are suspected of being connected with these robbers.
                                Others also, who joined the band as detectives, are suspected of
                                having been connected with the robbery. These things have arrayed
                                one portion of our citizens against another portion, and parties
                                have been formed by their friends on both sides. Hence there is at
                                this time great danger of a collision between these parties, whilst
                                they are both really all the time driving at the same purpose - all
                                endeavoring to put down this lawless band. This is a brief statement
                                of the condition of affairs there now. Day before yesterday there
                                was real danger of a collision, and that was one reason why I was
                                not in the House yesterday; I was in consultation with the Governor
                                who was receiving dispatches from my county. This morning two
                                gentlemen are here from Martin county, who look at this matter from
                                different stand points. Of course I do not wish to misrepresent
                                either of them. I will say, however, that in my judgment this matter
                                has gone far enough; and I shall state to the Governor that I deem
                                it to be his duty to put down that excitement, no matter who is
                                engaged in it that our citizens may go on with their business
                                avocations without being required to come out to protect the jail
                                every two or three days. For I would rather, sir, that those
                                prisoners in that jail were strung up between heaven and earth - I
                                would rather see them subjected to mob violence, than the present
                                excitement should continue. I say this, much as I am opposed in
                                general to Judge Lynch. There was a report about a Mr. Dromgoole,
                                lately a lawyer in our county, from the State of Tennessee, whose
                                sympathies were with the South, and when this war broke out he wrote
                                a letter tendering the service of a regiment of men to Jeff. Davis,
                                which, of course, was altogether unwarrantable; for I undertake to
                                say that there could not be found twenty men in the State of Indiana
                                who would engage in that service. But it was understood that Jeff.
                                Davis answered his letter; and the circumstance aroused the
                                indignation of our people, and they got to- gether and told Mr. Dromgoole that he
                                had better leave - that perhaps he could find some more congenial
                                clime than Martin county. And he did leave, but not until he had
                                involved one of our citizens in a difficult old man. I regret one
                                thing, that a son of the old man struck Dromgoole with a cane,
                                before the old man, who was abundantly able, gave him a whipping.
                                Our citizens gave Dromgoole money to bear his expenses to Tennessee.
                                The rumor that he had returned and was at the head of three hundred
                                men, is false on its face. I know that Mr. New land, who telegraphed
                                that rumor, was misinformed. No doubt be believed what he sent; but
                                he certainly did a great wrong, not only to the people of our
                                county, but to the people of the counties of Spencer, Harrison,
                                Floyd, &c., as though they could permit a marauding party to
                                pass through them without resistance. This rumor, no doubt, grew out
                                of the existence of the band of robbers to which I have referred.
                                Yesterday we received a dispatch that Capt. Noblott's company had
                                arrested these detectives at the county seat; but I am informed by
                                the Captain that his company took no part in that thing; only some
                                were selected to guard the jail. So there is a misunderstanding, but
                                I repeat my belief that they are all driving at the same object.
                        
                        
                            GEORGE B. DEWEY.
                            Mr. McLEAN presented the petition of George B. Dewey, of Terre Haute,
                                for $305 49, on account of expenses incurred by him in raising a
                                company of cavalry, and asked that it be referred to the
                                    Committee on Military Affairs.
                            On motion by Mr. GRESHAM, it was referred to the Committee

                            Mr. KITCHEN presented the petition of the President and Board of
                                Trustees of the town of Newburgh, Warrick county, for an amendment
                                of the General Corporation Act of 1852, so as to include section
                                twenty four of the old act.
                            On motion by Mr. GIFFORD, it was referred to the Committee
                                    on Corporations.
                        
                        
                            MILITARY DUTY - PENALTY.
                            Mr. HAYS submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Military Affairs be instructed to
                                            inquire into the expediency of reporting a bill, at
                                            their earliest possible convenience, providing that each
                                            and every person in this State liable to bear arms under
                                            the Constitution and laws thereof, who shall fail,
                                            refuse, neglect or omit to enrole themselves among the
                                            active militia of the State, shall be required to pay an
                                            annual lax of not less than two dollars; and that
                                            provision be made in said bill for the collection of
                                            said tax; and that said bill shall further provide that
                                            if the amount of tax thus raised should exceed the
                                            amount appropriated for the support of the active
                                            militia of the State, that the excess shall go to the
                                            support of the common schools of the State.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. GRESHAM. If the gentleman will change it, so as to make it a
                                resolution of inquiry, I will vote for it.
                            On motion by Mr. BUNDY, it was so modified; and then -
                            The resolution was adopted.
                            Mr. ERWIN submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Judiciary
                                                Committee be instructed to inquire as to
                                            what legislation, if any, is necessary in reference to
                                            the holders of lands in districts detached from one
                                            county and attached to another under the law of 1857-9,
                                            having their deeds recorded in the county to which such
                                            districts have been attached.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. ERWIN. Under the operation of the act mentioned, a portion of
                                Jackson county was detached and added to our county; and in cases
                                where persons were required to give certificate that their land is
                                free from incumbrance - as where it is mortgaged to secure the loan
                                of school funds - we want to know where the record is to be kept,
                                and where it may be examined. It is a matter I do not understand
                                myself, and would be glad to have it considered by the
                                    Judiciary Committee.
                            The resolution was adopted.

                            Mr. HENRICKS submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Be it Resolved by the General Assembly of
                                                the State of Indiana, That our Senators in
                                            Congress be instructed and our Representatives requested
                                            to use their best efforts to procure the passage of a
                                            law by Congress, at its extra session in July next,
                                            granting to each volunteer who may serve in the army of
                                            the United States during the existence of the present
                                            war for the suppression of rebellion, one hundred and
                                            sixty acres of land, to be located on any land subject
                                            to private entry in any of the States or Territories of
                                            the United States, so guarded as to secure its use and
                                            benefit to the volunteer and his immediate
                                            representatives.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Governor be and he
                                            is hereby requested to furnish a copy of these
                                            resolutions to each of our Senators and Representatives
                                            in Congress.
                                    
                                
                            
                            On motion by Mr. WOODHULL, it was referred to the Committee
                                    on Military Affairs.
                        
                        
                            HOME GUARDS.
                            On motion of Mr. GRESHAM, his Home Guards Bill, [-] was considered on
                                the second reading, laid on the table, and ordered to be
                                printed.
                        
                        
                            INDIANA LEGION.
                            Mr. ORR introduced a bill [42] for the regulation and government of
                                such Volunteer Militia companies as have filed their muster rolls in
                                the office of the Adjutant General of the State, and elected their
                                officers, and tendered their services to the Governor for active
                                service in the army of the United States, under the call made by the
                                Governor, April 1861, and who have not yet been received into the
                                active service, constituting them the reserved corps af the State,
                                and making provision for their admission into the Indiana
                                Legion.
                            On motion by Mr. ORR, (the rules being suspended for the purpose,) it
                                was read twice and referred to the Committee on Military
                                    Affairs.
                        
                        
                            TOWNS.
                            Mr. JONES, of Wayne, introduced a bill [43] to legalize the
                                incorporotion of towns under an act for the incorporation of towns,
                                defining their powers and duties, &c., approved June 11, 1852,
                                and all by-laws, rules, regulations and proceedings adopted in
                                pursuance thereof. The bill was passed the first reading.
                            Mr. JONES. I will state in reference to that bill, that there are two
                                towns in my county, (and no doubt there are other towns in the State
                                in the same condition,) that were incorporated under the general
                                corporation before that law was in force before the laws were
                                distributed. In the county seat of my county, it has become
                                important that certain acts taken by them before the corporation law
                                went into force should be legalized. I therefore move that the rules
                                be suspended, and that the bill be read the second time now.
                            
                            The motion was agreed to, and the bill was read the second time by
                                title.
                            Mr. JONES. I move that it be referred to the Committee on
                                    Corporations.
                            Mr. PARRETT. There can be nothing gained by that reference. I move
                                that it go to the Committee on the Judiciary.
                            The latter motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            NORTHERN STATE PRISON.
                            Mr. HEFFREN submitted a resolution, requesting the State Printer to
                                inform the House why the minority report of the Select
                                    Committee on the Affairs of the Northern State Prison
                                was not printed with the report of the majority.
                            He said the minority report was made the day we adjourned the regular
                                session; and the order was that it should be printed with the
                                majority report. This has not been done; and I want to know whose
                                fault it is whether it is the Clerk's or the Printer's. I suppose it
                                will be an easy matter for the printer to make the statement.
                            The SPEAKER The Printer has given the Chair the reason. He was not
                                aware of the existence of any such order, till after the majority
                                report was printed. He found the order in the Journal of the House.
                                He states, that so far as the remainder of copies are concerned, the
                                minority report will form a part of the document. The present delay
                                is on account of the binding.
                            The resolution was adopted.
                            The SPEAKER stated that the 8th regiment of volunteers had desired
                                the front of the Capital yard for a flag presentation this
                                afternoon. - The order was taken by consent. - Mr. ORR introduced a
                                bill, [44] providing a forfeiture for any person who shall fail to
                                become a member of some regularly organized company in the Indiana
                                Legion, or in some other company authorized by law, and making
                                provision for the collection of such penalty or forfeiture. [Penalty
                                $5 a month after the first day of September.]
                            Mr. WOODHULL. It seems to me that bill must have been intended to
                                make business for justices of the peace. It would certainly prove
                                more advantageous to them than to the people at large.
                            A VOICE - "Move to reject it."
                            Mr. HEFFREN. While I would like to see every citizen of the State of
                                Indiana take the same position I do on the question of State
                                defense, yet we must go according to law and the requirements of the
                                Constitution.
                            [He read from the 3d section of the Bill of Bights, prohibiting laws
                                controlling religious opinions or interfering with the rights of
                                conscience.]
                            There is a class of citizens amongst us, known toy the general name
                                of Quakers, who, by their religious education and conscience are
                                opposed to bearing arms. Of course, all such persons, under this
                                constitution, can not be compelled to bear arms. Therefore I move to
                                reject the bill.
                            It was rejected without a division.
                        
                        
                            PROTECTION OF SWINGING BRIDGES.
                            Mr. JENKINSON introduced a bill, [45] for preservation and
                                maintenance of swinging bridges across canals and streams of water
                                within the corporate limits of the cities and towns in the State of
                                Indiana.
                            Mr. PARRETT moved to reject the bill.
                            Mr. JENKINSON explained the necessity for, such a provision of law.
                                He wanted to make reckless men and their employers, responsible for
                                unnecessary damage to such bridges.
                            Mr. PROW. I shall sustain the motion to reject, not because I would
                                not like to see such a bill pass, but because we ought not to go
                                into subjects of general legislation. The Senate have adopted a
                                positive rule against such legislation, and it is perfectly certain
                                the bill could not pass that body.
                            Mr. EDSON. I understand that the Senate have to-day rescinded that
                                rule.
                            Mr. BUNDY. I do not think it respectful to the gentleman from Allen
                                to vote to reject his bill, although I think I should vote against
                                it if it were on the final passage.
                            Mr. JENKINSON demanded the yeas and nays; and the House refused to
                                reject the bill, by yeas 14, nays 59 - and it was passed to the
                                second reading to-morrow.
                        
                        
                            REPRESENTATIVE APPORTIONMENT.
                            Mr. HOLCOMB submitted a resolution for a committee of one from each
                                Congressional District, whose duty it shall be to report to this
                                House a bill apportioning the State into Senatorial and
                                Representative districts.
                            On the motion of Mr. Speaker ALLEN, [Mr. Sherman in the Chair] it was
                                laid on the table.
                        
                        
                            LEVEES AND DRAINS.
                            Mr. HENRICKS said he had introduced a bill some time ago to repeal
                                the levee and drain law, which was referred to the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary, and that
                                committee had reported a bill in lieu. He therefore would move to
                                suspend the order of business, that that bill might be
                                taken up. It was on the second reading.
                            The motion was agreed to, and the committee bill [32] supplemental to the act of
                                June, 1852, authorizing levees and drains, was taken up. [Before the
                                company can make assessments it shall execute a bond with surety in
                                double the amount of the assessment, conditioned for the faithful
                                application of all the money collected.]
                            On motion by Mr. HENRICKS, the bill was ordered to be engrossed. -
                                Mr. Veatch's bill, [H. R. 24]
                                fixing the term of office for the Superintendents of the benevolent
                                institutions of the State, was ordered to be engrossed.
                            Messrs. BURGESS, GROVER and HURD had leave of absence
                                indefinitely.
                            Mr. BUNDY - the order of business being suspended for the purpose -
                                asked and obtained leave to make a report from the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary; and he reported
                                Mr. McLean's bill, [H. R. 36] to provide for stamping worthless bank
                                bills, without amendment, and with an expression of opinion that the
                                same ought to pass.
                            The report was concurred in, and the bill was ordered to be engrossed
                                for the third reading.
                            On motion by Mr. GRAIN, the several relief bills of the House of
                                Representatives, viz.: the propositions for a stay law, and for a
                                real estate redemption law, were taken up and made the special order
                                of the day for to-morrow at two o'clock, P. M.
                            The House then took a recess till two o'clock, P. M.
                        
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The SPEAKER announced the order of the consideration of bills on the
                                second reading.
                            Mr. Veatch's execution stay bill [35] was made the special order for
                                to-morrow at two o'clock.
                            Mr. Collins of Whitley's new judicial circuit bill [30] was considered, and
                                referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.

                            
                                THE STATE HOUSE GUARD.
                                Mr. FRASIER. Mr. Speaker - I rise to a question of personal
                                    privilege. I wish to inquire by what authority it is that this
                                    building has been placed under military guard, go that members
                                    of this House, and others, are challenged at the doors of the
                                    committee rooms by armed men, and not permitted to enter?
                                The SPEAKER. The Chair is unable to answer the gentleman. Perhaps
                                    good-looking, respectable looking men are permitted to pass.
                                Mr. FRASIER. Mr. Speaker - I am not very particular about my
                                    rights as an individual, but I do not like to see quite so much
                                    land taken by some men. And I want a committee appointed to wait
                                    upon the proper officers, and inquire why a guard of men with
                                    arms in their hands, has been placed at the door of certain
                                    rooms in this building? If we give the use of the yard to the
                                    military, I do not suppose that includes authority to blockade
                                    the rooms of the capitol.
                                The SPEAKER. If the gentleman desires it, the Chair will
                                    entertain the motion.
                                Mr. FORD. I move that the Door-keeper be furnished with a musket
                                    and bayonet to drive off the guards.
                                Mr. Frasier's motion was agreed to, and the Speaker appointed
                                    Messrs. Frusier, Edson and Ford said committee.
                            
                            
                                STATE AUDITOR'S BONDS.
                                Mr. HAYS' bill, [41] to increase the official bonds of the
                                    Auditor of State to $100,000, was considered, and ordered to be
                                    engrossed.
                            
                            
                                HUNTINGTON COMMON PLEAS.
                                The bill [S.20] to amend
                                    the 20th section of the Common Pleas Act of March 5, 1850, was
                                    passed to the third reading, under a dispensation of the
                                    rules.
                                Mr. JENKINSON stated that it was for the special accommodation of
                                    the people in Huntington county; and on his motion it was
                                    ordered to the third reading, rend the third time and passed
                                    yeas 78, nays 0.
                            
                            
                                THE STATE HOUSE GUARD.
                                Mr. FRASIER, from the special committee to inquire into the cause
                                    of the military guards in the Capitol, reported verbally, that
                                    they waited on the Governor, and learned through him, that the
                                    guards were properly placed in the building at the commencement
                                    of the military rally, and that they were continued (the
                                    Governor supposes) through some mistake of the under officers.
                                    The guards were introduced at first to keep the crowd; away from
                                    the platform. Orders would be sent to have them withdrawn.
                                So the matter was dropped.
                            
                            
                                ADJOURNMENT SINE DIE.
                                On the motion of Mr. CRAIN, the Senate's joint resolution to
                                    adjourn the session next Monday without day, (just reported by
                                    Secretary pier,) was taken up.
                                Mr. NEBEKER. The reason for putting the adjournment on Monday
                                    was, that there must be three days after the work is done for
                                    the Governor's consideration of bills.
                                Mr. P'ARRETT. There is no such Monday as May 29th. I move to
                                    amend by substituting the "27th" for the "29th." I think that is
                                    probably the best time to adjourn for the reason stated by the
                                    gentleman from Warren; and for the further reason, that probably
                                    we will have as much business as we can well complete between
                                    this and Friday evening. I think also that we shall feel that we
                                    have enough to do.
                                Mr. HEFFREN. I think if the Legislature had not done half so much
                                    as it has we would have been better off, and for this reason I
                                    think the sooner we adjourn the better for the State. If we stay
                                    here or agree to stay here to adjourn on Monday, when the six
                                    o'clock train shall leave on Saturday you won't have a
                                    corporal's guard here you won't have members enough left to pass
                                    a resolution You can't compel us to stay here unless we will;
                                    and I see nothing that we need to stay here for, except that one
                                    thing which we in the southern counties are specially
                                    interested, and which has been made the special order for
                                    to-morrow at two o'clock. I prefer to adjourn on Saturday, the
                                    25th, at two o'clock.
                                Mr. UNDERWOOD submitted an amendment to that effect.
                                Mr. SPEAKER. The Chair would suggest that if we adjourn on the
                                    25th both branches must act on the relief measures
                                    to-morrow.
                                SEVERAL VOICES. " That can't be done." "Withdraw the
                                    amendment."
                                Mr. FISHER. It strikes me that this forcing the time to adjourn
                                    is a little premature. There are several bills that ought to
                                    pass and must pass very important to the interests of the State
                                    - and if we wish to protect the interests of the State so far as
                                    the disbursement of money is concerned we must pass them
                                    carefully. No man is more desirous to get home than II would be
                                    glad to get home this week. But I fear if we pass that
                                    resolution we will get along with the business in a way in which
                                    the State will eventually suffer loss. Whenever we get our
                                    important bills passed - those that are absolutely important -
                                    and send them to the Governor, he must then have his three days.
                                    In that time we can pass this resolution. I do not think these
                                    adjournment resolutions will advance business much any way. All
                                    the important measures ought to be acted upon with great care. I
                                    move to lay the resolution on the table.
                                Mr. HEFFREN. I ask for a division of the question, as between the
                                    resolution and the amendment.
                                Mr. FISHER. I withdraw the motion.
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN. (Mr. Bundy in the Chair.) I do not think there
                                    is a man here who desires to remain an hour longer than shall be
                                    necessary for the passage of laws to protect the interests of
                                    the State such as are necessarily connected with the emergency
                                    in which we find ourselves. I think it better to pass over the
                                    resolution informally, and get along as rapidly as we can. And
                                    when we see the time when, we can  get through, if it is Monday, or
                                    Wednesday, or Saturday, then we can take up the resolution and
                                    adopt it, with the proper amendment. It is highly improper that
                                    we should consider business of such importance as that now in
                                    our hands without due consideration. We can know at least three
                                    days in advance of the time when we can get through. There are
                                    two or three important bills I could name; first this relief
                                    measure, that is a matter that will occupy more than one day of
                                    the time of the House alone. Then it will have to go to the
                                    other branch. Then there are the appropriation bills - specific
                                    and general. The Senate have not yet acted upon them. Then there
                                    is the House bill for subsistence commissioners, embracing a
                                    very necessary guard of the interests of the State in the
                                    disbursement of vast sums of money which we have appropriated
                                    this session. It is as much our duty to see that these
                                    disbursements shall be properly and economically made as it was
                                    to make the appropriations in the first place. Holding these
                                    views I hope the resolution will be passed over.
                                Mr. HEFFREN. I desire to ask the gentleman from Knox one
                                    question. Is there not a tacit understanding that this session
                                    is to be lengthened out expressly for the purpose of repealing
                                    the common pleas system?
                                Mr. ALLEN. If there is I know nothing of it. But I will say to
                                    the gentleman from Washington and Harrison that I expect myself
                                    tomorrow morning to present a bill to repeal the common picas
                                    system. I will also say to the House that I would not vote to
                                    extend the time of the session a single hour if it were only for
                                    the purpose of abolishing the common pleas system.
                                Mr. DAVIS. I am concious that there are several bills of great
                                    importance which remain to be acted upon. There is one to which
                                    I attach most importance. It is that with regard to the county
                                    auditors - curtailing their duties and saving a vast sum to the
                                    State.
                                Mr. WOODHULL also was in favor of passing over the resolution
                                    informally.
                                Mr. NEBEKER. As long as the Legislature holds on it will receive
                                    business - whether material or immaterial-every kind of bills
                                    will be received. And for this purpose the Senate has already
                                    removed the rule against general legislation. I say, sir, that
                                    we are not prepared for general legislation; but just so long as
                                    we are here we will be going ahead with this nonsense. Whereas
                                    if we fix the day of adjournment, both branches will work to it
                                    and concentrate their efforts and energies to get though. Of
                                    course there will be confusion in the close. It never can be
                                    otherwise than that there will be a muss at the close of the
                                    session. It would be unconstitutional to dispense with it.
                                    [Laughter.
                                ]Mr. PARRETT. We agreed at the first that we would not go into
                                    general legislation; and we have not and will not. I endorse the
                                    remarks of the Speaker. I see no use in fixing a day certain for
                                    adjournment, in advance of business that must be done. I repeat
                                    we do not remain here for any purpose of general legislation;
                                    but if a gentleman wishes to introduce a bill looking to general
                                    legislation let him do so; and perhaps we may dispose of it
                                    without interfering with the special business of the session. I
                                    hope the resolution will be passed over.
                                Mr. SMITH of Bartholomew dissented from the view taken by the
                                    gentleman from Warren, [Mr. Nebeker.] He referred to necessity
                                    for action on the subsistence bill we had sent to the Senate,
                                    and by which large amounts of money would be saved to State.
                                The resolution was then laid on the table affirmative 41,
                                    negative 22.
                            
                            
                                SUPERINTENDENTS OF THE BENEVOLENT
                                    INSTITUTIONS.
                                Mr. Veatch's bill, [34] fixing the terms of office for the
                                    superintendents of the benevolent institutions of the State,
                                    coming up - the question being, shall the bill be engrossed?
                                Mr. HEFFREN hoped the House would not engross that bill. It was
                                    an attempt to legislate out of office the present Superintendent
                                    of the Insane Hospital, because that gentleman's politics differ
                                    from the politics of a majority of this House. Against such
                                    legislation, especially at this time, he entered his solemn
                                    protest.
                                Mr. FISHER'S understanding was, that there was no law fixing the
                                    term of office of the present superintendent. If there was such
                                    a law he would oppose the bill.
                                Mr. ORR desired explanation of the bill.
                                On motion by Mr. HEFFREN, it was laid on the table.

                                The SPEAKER laid before the House the following communication
                                    from the public printer:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            
                                                To HON. CYRUS M. ALLEN, Speaker
                                                  of the House:
                                            
                                            In response to a resolution of the House, of which I
                                                have just been notified, demanding the reason why
                                                the minority report of the committee on the
                                                  Northern Penitentiary is not printed
                                                with the majority report; I desire to inform the
                                                House that the minority report is printed with the
                                                majority report in the copies ordered by the House.
                                                Those ordered by the Senate contain only the
                                                minority report made to that body, as ordered by
                                                them. I presume, in the distribution of the reports
                                                by the Doorkeeper, some of the Senate copies have
                                                been accidentally substituted for those belonging to
                                                the House.
                                            
                                                Respectfully,
                                                B. R. SULGROVE.
                                                INDIANAPOLIS,
                                                
                                                  May 21, 1861.
                                                
                                            
                                        
                                    
                                
                                On motion by Mr. HEFFREN, it was
                                Ordered, That the Doorkeeper distribute the
                                    House quota of said reports, and lay them on the desks of
                                    members.
                            
                            
                                SURGEONS IN THE MILITARY SERVICE.
                                Mr. FISHER asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill [56]
                                    appointing a Board of Medical Examiners, to examine applicants
                                    for surgeons, and requiring the Governor to select such as have
                                    certificates of qualification. [The bill appoints Drs. Btbbs,
                                    Dunlap and Jamison said board.]
                                The bill was read twice under a dispensation, and considered on
                                    the second reading.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG said he would like to have the merits of the bill
                                    examined by a committee. He would like to understand its
                                    necessity, and then, if it were necessary to rush it though, he
                                    would vote for it.
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN. (Mr. Bundy in the Chair.) The surgeons in the
                                    six regiments in  the
                                    service of the United States were appointed without professional
                                    examination, and he had understood that there were complaints of
                                    incompetency in some of the surgeons' mates. It was important
                                    that no man should be appointed to such a place unless he is
                                    entirely competent. It might be said, the Governor will appoint
                                    none unless he comes well recommended. He knew something about
                                    this recommending men to place, and thought the safest rule
                                    would be to reject the man with the largest string of names.
                                    Merit is always modest; and as a general rule the modest man
                                    relies upon his consciousness of competency, and does not go the
                                    trouble of getting recommendations; but the man who is conscious
                                    of his incompetency is sure to come up with names. In every
                                    other State in the Union they have such a law. It was the only
                                    way to arrest and keep incompetent surgeons out of the service.
                                    Diplomas would not always decide as to a man's fitness; and the
                                    gentleman would not deny the necessity to provide against
                                    political influences and personal favoritism. It was important
                                    the bill should be passed at once.
                                Mr. ORR hoped the House would be careful to see that the members
                                    of the proposed board were men of ample qualification.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON proposed to recommit the bill with instructions to
                                    amend by adding a provision for the establishment of a board of
                                    examiners to examine Applicants for positions as field and staff
                                    offices in the present service.
                                He had been appealed to for this provision of law; and he
                                    considered it quite as important that we should be careful about
                                    the appointment of men to lead where wounds would be received,
                                    as that we should provide competent surgeons to heal them.
                                The SPEAKER [Mr. Bundy] ruled the amendment out of order so far
                                    as the instructions were concerned.
                                Mr. KENDRICK opposed the bill. He considered the fact that
                                    nothing had been said about the appointment of the surgeons in
                                    the United States service, and that now the surgeons wore to be
                                    appointed for the State's regiments. A few days ago there were
                                    petitions sent down from the Camp for the appointment of
                                    physicians from other than the Allopathic schools. Whether this
                                    petition had anything to do with the getting up of this bill for
                                    a board of curators for the examination of candidates for
                                    surgeons' places he did not know; but if it had any thing to do
                                    with it he was down on the bill. It was well known that Eclectic
                                    physicians were recognized everywhere. He said this being
                                    himself an Eclectic. He would be allowed also to say, that many
                                    reputed regular physicians were quacks. But it was well known
                                    that no regular physician on the proposed board would dare to
                                    admit an Eclectic to serve as a surgeon in the army.
                                Mr. WOODHULL. Are these men named in the bill Allopaths or
                                    Eclectics?
                                Mr. KENDRICK. Allopaths. I do not wish to say anything harsh. I
                                    respect the feelings of men as expressed in their choice of a
                                    physician or surgeon. They have a right to that choice. I have
                                    no sinister view in what I say. I do not expect an appointment
                                    myself in the military service; still, certainly, if I were
                                    appointed a surgeon, I should do what I could to justify ever
                                    expectation and fulfill every duty of the position.
                                Mr. HEFFREN. I don't know much about Allopathy and Homoepathy,
                                    but I think if we stay much longer here upon this bill we will
                                    all have a diarrhoea to-morrow.
                                Mr. KENDRICK. If the gentleman is in trouble can give him a
                                    remedy.
                                Mr. HEFFREN. There are some cases here that need doctoring very
                                    much, and I am glad have a gentleman on the floor that can
                                    attend to them. [Laughter.]

                            THURSDAY, May 23, 1861.
                        
                        Mr. MELLETT, from the Committee on Military Affairs,
                            returned Senator Anthony's bill S. No. 18, (identical with the Militia
                            bill H. R. 21, now a law,) recommending that it lie on the table.
                        The report was concurred in.
                        
                            CARROLL AND TIPPECANOE COMMON PLEAS COURTS.
                            Mr. ODELL introduced a bill [S. No.
                                    36] entitled "A bill to change the time of holding the
                                common pleas court in the counties of Carroll and Tippecanoe, making
                                all process returnable thereto, and declaring when this act shall
                                take effect," which was read the first time.
                            On motion by Mr. ODELL, the rules were suspended - yeas 34, nays 0 -
                                the bill read the second time by title only, and ordered to be
                                engrossed for the third reading.
                        
                        
                            FELONY AND ITS PUNISHMENT.
                            Mr. COBB introduced a bill [S.
                                    37] entitled "An act defining what shall constitute a
                                felony, and fixing a penalty therefor" which was read the first
                                time.
                            On motion by Mr. COBB, the rules were suspended - yeas 35, nays 0 -
                                the bill read the second time by title only, and referred to the
                                    Judiciary Committee.
                        
                        
                            GARNISHEE AGAINST OFFICERS.
                            Mr. MILLER, from the Judiciary Committee, returned
                                his bill S. No.26, introduced
                                yesterday, recommending its passage without amendment.
                            The report was concurred in, and so the bill was placed on the files
                                for the third reading.
                            By unanimous consent, Mr. LINE offered a resolution "That the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary be instructed to
                                inquire whether there may not be additional powers conferred on the
                                clerks of courts to facilitate the settlements of estates, subject
                                to the ratification of the court, and report by bill or otherwise,"
                                which was adopted.
                        
                        
                            INDEPENDENT MILITARY COMPANIES.
                            Senator Wolfe's military bill No. 21 was read the third time.
                            Mr. LINE. I did not notice, by the reading, a provision in the bill
                                for filling vacancies which may occur either by death, resignation,
                                or other causes. It seems to me such a provision ought to be
                                incorporated.
                            Mr. WOLFE, by unanimous consent, amended the bill by inserting in the
                                proper place the words: "In case a vacancy or vacancies may
                                occur."
                            Mr. MURRAY. I desire briefly to give my reasons for voting against
                                that bill. The object  ize
                                companies of home guardsmen who are past the ages required under the
                                military bill, and to divert the arms that we are about to purchase
                                for the militia of the State, and also to take a portion of the
                                $70,000 appropriated for the drilling and equipment of the militia,
                                and hand it over to these home guards or independent companies.
                                Further it proposes to attach for regimental or brigade drill these
                                home guards, the effect of which will be a total disorganization and
                                defeat of the objects of the military bill we have passed. This bill
                                proposes that only the militia shall be called into active service
                                by the Governor, and these home companies shall be released from all
                                obligations - they shall remain at home after receiving a portion of
                                the arms of the State and all the benefits of regimental and brigade
                                drills. I think the only object of the bill is to authorize the
                                organization of home guards of old gentlemen who shall have all the
                                benefits of State arms and money, and then when their services are
                                demanded, they may step out and disorganize the regiments to which
                                they may have been attached. For this reason I shall vote against
                                the bill.
                            Mr. WOLFE. The reason why this bill was brought before the Senate is,
                                that I find the military bill passed by the Legislature, being a
                                voluntary system entirely, may perhaps be facilitated in its
                                operations by the passage of a bill of this kind. Now I do not know,
                                under the present military bill of the State, how many companies
                                will be organized: I presume, however, there will be at least as
                                many companies organized as can be armed by the State. Should the
                                Governor in his discretion form the regiments of a less number than
                                twelve companies, this bill permits such regiments to be filled up
                                by the addition of these independent companies. These State troops
                                are minute men, and there are many patriotic citizens of the State
                                who are not disposed to enter into a service of that kind: yet these
                                men are just as patriotic and just as much disposed to do military
                                service as any other men, but who need military education and
                                instruction all the time. I am not certain the bill we have already
                                pass-el was necessary, but I voted for it believing it would do no
                                harm. We know from experience, that the people of the State of
                                Indiana are willing to volunteer, for they have responded to the
                                call of the State and General Governments in a manner almost
                                astounding. I am informed that over 25,000 men responded where only
                                six regiments were called for. There was no necessity for an
                                organization coercing men to do a patriotic service, and so the bill
                                went upon the correct principle when it was placed upon the
                                voluntary principle, and to that extent it was right. But there are
                                men whose position will not allow them to be placed as minute-men,
                                liable to be called any where or to any place upon short notice. I
                                have no doubt there will be enough men raised under the present law
                                to use all the guns furnished, but the regiments cannot be filled as
                                well without the passage of this bill. It is important that the bill
                                should pass in order that regiments may be formed without marching
                                companies from distant counties for that purpose. The Government has
                                the right to reject or receive these independent companies, just as
                                the demands of the case may require. The service in the regiment is
                                simply for the purpose of military instruction and home protection.
                                Such companies would be regarded as lawful companies without law,
                                but in that case they would be controlled by their own laws instead
                                of legislative enactment. Gentlemen go upon the assumption that
                                these companies are not to do any service. We have passed a bill
                                authorizing cities and incorporated towns to put arms into the hands
                                of responsible home organizations for self protection, but this bill
                                provides that these companies shall not cost the State one cent, and
                                it is only when they are armed and uniformed that they can be
                                received. I take it that when a call is made for troops, these
                                independent companies will volunteer as other companies have done
                                heretofore. This thing is no more voluntary than the bill we have
                                already passed, which is also wholly voluntary; for there is no
                                power to compel a man to join the State legion. The objection urged
                                to this bill amounts simply to nothing. Under the present law there
                                are competent men who can not get into the State Legion. This bill
                                provides that all over seventeen may become members of these
                                independent companies, and I tell you that is not too soon to
                                commence learning. There are men over 45 years of age who are
                                qualified to do military duty. The history of the world is full of
                                exploits of men over 45' on the battle Held; and now such men can
                                not lawfully take arms into their hands. Is it not proper" that
                                    that silver grey, stern, solid element should form a
                                portion of our Home Guard? When there i& a military spirit in
                                the country you can not keep men from going through the motions
                                anyhow. This bill was drawn up carefully, and I think ia well
                                guarded. I hope it will be considered calmly and dispassionately,
                                and that it will receive a majority of the votes of members.
                            Mr. MILLER. The Committee on Military Affairs,
                                when this bill was before them, wad not full. There were but five
                                members present besides the chairman. Two were opposed to this bill,
                                and it did not receive a very careful investigation. I make this
                                statement so that the force of the committee may not have any undue
                                weight upon the minds of Senators. It was thought well enough to
                                allow it to be referred back to the Senate for action without any
                                minority report against the bill, expecting that the bill would be
                                discussed and Senators could judge for themselves as well without as
                                with anything that might be said in a minority report. I have
                                listened attentively to the Senator from Harrison [Mr. Wolfe], and
                                he has failed to convince me that there is any necessity for this
                                measure or that it would be productive of any good. My chief
                                objection to the bill is that it is entirely unnecessary. We have
                                already passed a bill which provides for the organization of
                                companies under the voluntary system. As I understand the bill, it
                                raises a sort of independent, sedentary, peace militia, gotten up on
                                the plan of the Home Guards, which I suppose are to belike a company
                                in one of the Southern States, of which I read the other day, where
                                the first article in their constitution was that they should not be
                                called upon to fight, or leave the State except in case of invasion,
                                [Laughter.] The gentleman's argument was that a great many men over
                                45 years and  of the bill, so
                                far as I understand it from the investigation before the committee,
                                is to organize a military force independent of the force already
                                proposed to be organized by the bill we passed at this special
                                session. It is a proposition to organ-boys of 17 are very patriotic.
                                I can inform the gentleman that such persons can, under the existing
                                law, form themselves into military companies and do as much duty as
                                they desire. He spoke eloquently about and passed a panegyric upon
                                the companies which have already been formed. Now those companies
                                were form under the law which he desires to repeal. If there is
                                anything to be deduced from his argument, it is that the present law
                                is sufficient. Another objection I have to the bill is this: There
                                is a door opened in the treasury of the county to keep up this
                                playful, peace-loving militia, which don't want to be called out in
                                case of war. It provides that county commissioners may arm and equip
                                them, and I don't want to give the commissioners that discretion. It
                                will cost an immense sum of money. The treasury will be sacked in
                                some quarters of the State for the purpose of uniforming and
                                equipping the people. There is no sort of use of a bill of this
                                sort; it is simply running the military system of the State into the
                                ground destroying the whole thing. We have no necessity of as many
                                men as the bill contemplates. He seems to think everybody, even I
                                may say men, women and children are to stand up here and defend
                                themselves from some foreign enemy. Now, I don't see any prospect of
                                an enemy being very near us, or our being invaded to any
                                considerable extent, though such a thing might possibly be. Now, if
                                the law which we have already passed, was not sufficient, then I
                                would be willing to see passed some such bill as this; or if the
                                gentleman had introduced a bill organizing a home guard proper, I
                                would have no objection to it; but this is to draw off a
                                considerable number of men who might go into the regular
                                service.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. In order to give time to consider the bill, I move that
                                it be made the special order for 10 o'clock to-morrow.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                            On motion by Mr. WOLFE one hundred copies of the bill were ordered to
                                be printed for the use of the Senate.
                        
                        
                            GARNISHEE AGAINST OFFICERS.
                            Senator Miller's bill, 26,
                                introduced yesterday, coming up in regular order, it was read the
                                third time.
                            Mr. MILLER. This is a bill which was passed at the regular session,
                                but which failed in the House for want of time. It is an important
                                measure, and I suppose is perfectly well under stood by the Senate.
                                It authorizes the process of garnisheement against officers. As the
                                law now is, when an officer holds money which has been collected by
                                him, the creditor can not get at it. It is a necessary law as every
                                lawyer knows. I believe it was passed through both the
                                    Judiciary Committees of the Senate and the
                                House.
                            The bill was finally passed the Senate by yeas 29, nays 5, with an
                                amendment of title, by striking out after the word "trustees."

                                introduced yesterday, was read the third time.
                            Mr. SHOEMAKER. This bill refers particularly to what was the county
                                seat of Posey county, and it is the same bill which passed the
                                Senate at the regular session, I believe unanimously.
                            The bill finally passed the Senate by yeas 33 nays 4.

                            The bill was then ordered to be engrossed for the third reading.

                            Mr. CARNAHAN. That bill passed the Senate at the regular session by a
                                large majority. I believe there is little or no objection. I
                                remember there was an amendment added in relation to lawyer's fees.
                                I think it unnecessary to mix up the farmers and lawyers. I move to
                                suspend the rules in order to read the bill a third time now.
                            A constitutional provision requires the yeas and nays. The motion was
                                agreed to by yeas 34, nays 6, and the bill was read the third
                                time.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON asked unanimous consent to amend by striking out of the
                                proviso all after the word "law."
                            Objections being made, the amendment failed.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON moved to refer the bill to the committee on
                                    agriculture with instructions to so amend. The bill as
                                it now stands allows the landlord to take the best coat a tenant
                                has, without respect to the exemption law. With my amendment the
                                tenant would have the benefit of the exemption law against the
                                landlord as well as against the lawyer, doctor, or any body
                                else.
                            Mr. CARNAHAN. I would like to know in what way the law could be
                                amended so as to make it better than the way the bill proposes.
                                There is no landlord but that secures himself, but in doing that
                                they subject the renter to the expense of giving a mortgage, and the
                                recording and acknowledging of that mortgage, which the renter has
                                to pay. If he has got no property to mortgage he is under the
                                necessity of giving personal security. In many instances they can
                                not do that, they must go off into the woods and cut cord wood to
                                support their families. At the present time it is necessary that
                                every man who can cul-  tivate
                                the soil should have a chance. As it is the owner will secure
                                himself at the expense of the tenant. Give the owner of the land a
                                lien upon the crop and then there is no difficulty. As it is there
                                is both a difficulty and an expense attending it.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. I am in favor of the doctrine of liens and see no
                                reason why there should be any discriminations between occupations.
                                I was in favor of this bill before, with the lawyer's clause in it,
                                and I desire to see it go to a committee with a view to see it
                                perfected in that particular; and I do not say this for the purpose
                                of retarding the progress of the bill, for, as far as my influence
                                is concerned, I will see that it is reported back at an early day.
                                As I said before I do not think there should be any discrimination
                                in this matter. I would have no objection to giving a doctor a lien
                                upon his patient -
                            A VOICE. "After he is dead."
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. Yes, for they will take it anyhow. [Laughter.] I move
                                to amend the motion to recommit by changing the reference to a
                                select committee of three.
                            Mr. MILLER. I think the bill is about right as it is. I have no
                                objection to a landlord or an attorney's lien, but I think the
                                landlord's is of more importance. I do not like to see the bill of
                                the gentleman from Posey burdened down by these arrangements. I am
                                opposed to the amendment of the gentleman from Putnam, [Mr.
                                Johnston] for I think it wrong.
                            Mr. MURRAY moved to lay the motion to recommit with instructions on
                                the table.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON demanded a division of the question. The motion to
                                recommit was laid on the table.
                            The motion to refer to a select committee of three was also laid on
                                the table.
                            Mr. SLACK moved to recommit and instruct the committee to amend so
                                that laborers upon farming lands, through whose labor crops are
                                produced, shall have a lien upon the growing crops to secure their
                                pay.
                            Mr. CARNAHAN. I accept that amendment.
                            Mr. DEHART moved to amend so as to provide that the preachers have a
                                lien upon all the yellow-legged cocks of their respective circuits.
                                [Laughter.]
                            Mr. CONLEY made an ineffectual motion yeas 14, nays 24 - to
                                indefinitely postpone the bill and pending amendments.
                            Mr. DEHART asked leave to withdrawn his amendment. [Laughter, and
                                cries of "consent," "consent," "no consent."]
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL, I am willing to forego the amendment embracing
                                attorneys in order that the bill may pass. I should like to see the
                                principle of liens more generally carried out. I am satisfied that
                                if this bill is amended it will be defeated. The object of the
                                amendment of the Senator from Huntington [Mr. Slack] is to defeat
                                the bill, although his intention may not be such. I would not object
                                to the lien being made upon the crop belonging to the tenant. But
                                you can not make a law that will enforce the collection of debt in
                                every case. The poorer families of the State are clustering around
                                our towns and villages for the reason that they can't procure a
                                respectable piece of land upon which to plant themselves. I trust
                                the bill may pass and that the amendments may be laid on the
                                table.
                            Mr. MARCH. The amendment of the Senator from Putnam [Mr. Johnston]
                                would give the bill more importance than it otherwise can have with
                                me. If I believed this bill would in any degree aid or accomplish
                                the ends the author has in view I would vote for it; but I believe
                                instead of benefitting the poorer classes it would only add to the
                                already too numerous instances of the power the landlord has over
                                the tenant. This doctrine originated in a country where the land and
                                the tenant were the property of the landlord. If there is any
                                portion of the State of Indiana where the rentor can not rent
                                property without being compelled to be subject to the landlord's
                                lien, and thereby throw himself into the power of the landlord, I
                                advise them to leave that section and go to another where I know
                                they can rent property, any quantity of it, without placing
                                themselves in the power of the landlord. The bill is an assumed
                                attack upon the honesty of the poorer c'asses of the people; I
                                undertake to say they are the honestest portion, and the fact that
                                they are poor is an evidence of their honesty. I do not mean to say
                                all wealth is accumulated by dishonesty, but I undertake to say that
                                no large amount of property can be piled up in an ordinary lifetime
                                without drawing more than an honest share of the proceeds of labor.
                                Instead of being in favor of the whole doctrine of liens I am
                                opposed to them, because it complicates human transactions and
                                affords food for law suits and controversies. If the man who rents
                                the soil should have a lien upon it, then the man who cultivates the
                                soil should have a lien upon it. The true principle with regard to
                                land is that it belongs to the human race. I shall vote for the
                                amendment of the Senator from Putnam.
                            Mr. WOLFE. Landlords are safe under the present law, and tenants
                                should make themselves safe also. The gentleman from Posey [Mr.
                                Carnahan] wants a law passed securing landlords, and yet relieving
                                tenants from giving personal security. Now that all looks well
                                enough. The old plan has been that the land was rented and the
                                tenant paid to the landlord a portion of the crop or the amount of
                                the rent in money. Let landlords hire the tenant to cultivate the
                                land and pay the tenant a portion of the crop for cultivating it. I
                                think the law as it now stands is ample to protect both landlords
                                and tenants. For this reason I am opposed to the bill.
                            Mr. CARNAHAN. I have no interest in this matter and never had, for I
                                never rented an acre of ground in my life. The law as it now stands
                                benefits but two classes - lawyers and large landholders; and I can
                                see no objections to the passage of this bill. It makes no necessity
                                for litigation, but the whole thing would be clearly understood.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I have listened to this discussion with much interest and
                                have yet to hear a single argument of any force against this bill.
                                It gives the landlord and tenant what is strictly and justly their
                                due. JN"ow where is there anything wrong in it? Look at the large
                                portion of lands in this State going without cultivation just for
                                the want of such a law as this. You pass this  bill and you bring into cultivation a
                                large amount of land that is absolutely lying idle, and thereby
                                cause a large crop to be raised that would not otherwise be brought
                                forth; and at the same time you deal justice to both landlord and
                                tenant. I will go with the lawyers on this floor for the pas sage of
                                a lien law in their favor, but I desire to see this bill passed as
                                it was introduced. I move to lay on the table the motion to recommit
                                with instructions. His motion was agreed to by yens 28, nays 13.
                            Mr. CARNAHAN demanded the previous question, and the demand was
                                seconded by thirty Senators.
                            The bill then finally passed by yeas 26, nays 13 - as follows:

                                COURTS.
                            On motion by Mr. SLACK, the House amendments to his bill, No. 20, introduced yesterday, were
                                read and concurred in. So the bill was finally passed.
                        
                        
                            ADJOURNMENT TILL TO MORROW.
                            Mr. LINE offered a resolution that when the Senate adjourns it be
                                till to-morrow, 9 o'clock, A. M., in consequence of the expected
                                military review in honor of the presence of the Governors of Ohio
                                and Illinois.
                            Objection being made from the fact that it was not certain when the
                                distinguished strangers would arrive.
                            Mr. LINE withdrew his resolution.
                        
                        
                            THE PAY OF MEMBERS.
                            On motion by Mr. COBB, the order of business was suspended and the
                                concurrent resolutions of the House of Representatives (printed in
                                the House proceedings of this day,) with regard to the pay of
                                members during the late recess, was taken from the files and
                                read.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB obtained the floor.
                            And then came the recess till 2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTEROON SESSION.
                            The Senate resumed the consideration of the House concurrent pay
                                resolution, pending at the time of taking the recess for dinner.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB cited authorities in his opposition remarks to the
                                passage of the resolution. A concurrent or joint resolution is not a
                                law. This resolution finds fault with the State Auditor. He never
                                would have voted for the recess resolution had he understood it
                                contemplated a per diem to members when at home.
                            Mr. MURRAY. This resolution was introduced at the suggestion of the
                                Auditor of State. He requested the passage of this resolution. He
                                did riot recognize this Legislature as being in session, not because
                                he doubted the sufficiency of a joint resolution. The question is
                                whether this is a recess or an adjournment sine
                                    die. I would ask whether the Auditor is bound to issue his
                                warrant for pay of members when an adjournment is from Friday till
                                Monday, is not as fully bound to issue his warrant for the time of a
                                recess even if it be for a week or ten days?
                            Mr. WOLFE. The Auditor of this State has been acting by warrant of
                                law. That officer has always audited a per diem
                                for Sundays, and that is not departing from the law any more than to
                                draw his warrant for the recess.
                            Mr. MELLETT. My understanding was that members were absent on
                                business of the General Assembly, and by order of the General
                                Assembly, to see whether their constituents wanted a stay law passed
                                or not. [Laughter.]
                            Mr. NEWCOMB. Saturdays and Sundays are part of the session. A
                                majority of members stay here and the work of committees are going
                                on. The constitution provides that neither house shall adjourn for
                                more than three days at a time, and when that is the case the work
                                or legislation does not go on. If gentlemen can show me any just
                                cause why they should receive pay for services never rendered then I
                                would vote for this resolution. At a time like this I think it
                                beneath the dignity of this Legislature to receive pay for
                                constructive service. This ten days service shall never go into my
                                pocket.
                            Mr. CARNAHAN moved to amend the resolution by striking out "per diem" and inserting "mileage."
                            Mr. MILLER and Mr. RAY had doubts as to whether the constitution
                                would permit members to draw mileage twice during the game
                                session.
                            Mr. MELLETT presumed that if this resolution be passed the Auditor
                                can require nothing more.
                            Mr. STEELE. As a matter of economy the amendment should not be
                                passed, for the mileage amounts to more than the per
                                    diem. The Senator from Marion [Mr. Newcomb] lives here,
                                while other members have to be at a large expense to go home and
                                return.
                            Mr. COBB. This resolution is right and ought to pass.
                            The amendment was rejected. The concurrent resolution of the House
                                then adopted by yeas 27, nays 15.

                                The PRESIDENT laid before the Senate a communication from the
                                    Quartermaster General in answer to Senator Robinson's resolution
                                    of yesterday, which was read and referred to the

                                                HON. JOHN R. CRAVENS, President
                                                  of the Senate:
                                            
                                            In answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 22d
                                                inst., I am obliged to say that this Department is
                                                not at this time prepared to furnish the "bids and

                                                having been handed over to, and are now in

                                The PRESIDENT also laid before the Senate the following
                                    communication from the Superintendent of Public Instruction in
                                    answer to Senator Studabaker's resolution of yesterday, which
                                    was read and referred to the Committee on
                                        Education, with instructions to report a bill to
                                    remedy the defects named in the communication.

                                                INSTRUCTION, Indianapolis, May 23,
                                                1861.
                                            
                                                To THE HON. JOHN R. CRAVENS, President of the SenatesDEAR SIR:
                                                
                                            
                                            In response to the Senate resolution of inquiry as to
                                                the delay in making the apportionment of school
                                                revenue, I would respectfully submit the
                                                following:
                                            Since the establishment of our present school system
                                                great difficulty has been experienced each year by
                                                failure of county auditors to report before the time
                                                the Superintendent was required to make the
                                                apportionment. My predecessors have been obliged to
                                                make the apportionment by guess, always disbursing a
                                                less amount than they would had they been in
                                                possession of the county auditors reports. The
                                                overplus would never be heard of again, and up to
                                                the time of my entering upon the duties of the
                                                office there had been a loss of $303,921 68 to the
                                                school revenue, all the result of making the
                                                apportionment by guess.
                                            The Legislature, at its last session, endeavored to
                                                remedy the matter by making each county whose county
                                                auditor failed to report, subject to a diminution of
                                                one hundred dollars in the apportionment, which sum
                                                the county could recover from the auditor. This
                                                provision of the law may hereafter prevent a
                                                reoccurrence of the difficulty, but it has entirely
                                                failed this year.
                                            There may, however, be some excuse in the present
                                                instance. The law was passed among the last acts of
                                                your late session, and it did not. perhaps, reach
                                                some of the auditors before the time they were
                                                required to report to me. In addition to this the
                                                delinquent list being unusually large, they say it
                                                was impossible for them to make the reports at the
                                                time required.
                                            Whether these excuses are satisfactory or not, it is
                                                a fact, that when the time came for my apportionment
                                                twenty-five counties had not reported. Having
                                                carefully considered this matter, and remembering
                                                the large amounts that had been lost by guess work,
                                                and knowing the inextricable confusion of our books
                                                by such a course, I determined not to make the
                                                apportionment until I had received every report, and
                                                thus be enabled to make a complete and full
                                                apportionment of the entire school revenues -
                                                leaving no ballance scattered in the various
                                                counties of the State. The counties up to this date
                                                having all reported but two - Benton and Martin - I
                                                would respectfully inquire whether, under existing
                                                circumstances, I shall subject these delinquent
                                                counties to the required diminution of one hundred
                                                dollars.
                                            From quite a number of the counties corrections have
                                                came in since the making of the reports, showing
                                                conclusively that the auditors, in order to comply
                                                with the law, reported by guess. I enclose a letter
                                                received this morning from White county, which is a
                                                specimen of the kind received on the subject,
                                                showing you the difficulty under which I have
                                                labored, and still labor, in this apportionment.
                                            
                                            Another matter I would suggest to your honorable
                                                body. The 111th section of the school law clearly
                                                provides the way in which the county auditors and
                                                treasurers should be paid for the collection and
                                                disbursement of school revenue. Notwithstanding
                                                this, and a circular upon this point by me to these
                                                officers, explaining the matter fully, many of them
                                                still retain their fees from the school revenue, in
                                                direct violation of the said 111th section of the
                                                school law.
                                            On the 22d day of April, the day on which the
                                                auditors should have reported, I addressed a note to
                                                all the delinquents, calling upon them to act
                                                promptly in this matter. To some of them I have
                                                written three or four times, and up to this date
                                                have received the reports from all the counties save
                                                the two named above. The following are the names of
                                                the counties reports were not received at time
                                                required by law, also the names of the auditors of
                                                such counties:

                                THE COMMISSARIAT.
                                Mr. HULL, from the Joint Select Committee
                                    hereon, made the following report:
                                The select committee of the two Houses to investigate the
                                    Commissary and Quartermaster's departments herewith submit the
                                    following report in relation to the Commissary Department. The
                                    investigation has been very tedious and laborious, yet we have
                                    endeavored to look into everything connected with the department
                                    with the closest scrutiny as far as we have set forth in this
                                    report.
                            
                            
                                RATION ALLOWANCES.
                                The first thing demanding our attention was the charge against
                                    the Commissary of short ration allowances; and in order that
                                    everything - connected with the duties of this office may fully
                                    understood, we would state that the Commissary General, so far
                                    as the duties of the present office is concerned, is an agent of
                                    the State receiving nothing for his services except his salary,
                                    and that it is his duty to the State to furnish good and healthy
                                    food for her soldiers at the lowest market price, charging the
                                    State only the amount so paid; and anything that this officer or
                                    any person under his control may make by way of commission,
                                    bonus or otherwise, would be a fraud upon the State and a
                                    criminal breach of trust. The soldiers being fresh from homes of
                                    plenty, and wholly unacquainted with the military service, and
                                    inexperienced in camp cooking and camp economy, the Governor and
                                    Commissary General thought best to issue extra rations to the
                                    troops and not confine them to the regular army rations, which,
                                    according to army regulations, are as follows, for each one
                                    hundred men:
                                Of pork, 75 pounds, and if of beef, 125 pounds; if of flour, 112
                                    2/3 pounds, and if of hard bread, 100 pounds; if of beans, 8
                                    quarts, and if of rice, 10 pounds; of coffee, 6 pounds; of
                                    sugar, 12 pounds; of vinegar, 1 gallon; of candles, 11/2 pounds;
                                    of soap, 4 pounds; of salt, 5 quarts.
                                The rations, as furnished by the Commissary, have been heretofore
                                    reported to this body to be as follows, for each one hundred
                                    men:
                                Of beef, 150 pounds, and if of pork, 110 pounds; of bread, 150
                                    pounds; of beans, 30 pounds, and if of rice, 12 pounds; of
                                    coffee, 8 pounds; of sugar, 16 pounds; of candles, 3 pounds; of
                                    soap, 6 pounds; of vinegar, 2 1/2 gallons; of salt, 12 pounds;
                                    of potatoes, 100 pounds; of pepper, 1 pound; of dried fruit, 1
                                    1/2 bushels; onions, 3 bushels, pickles and other anti
                                    scorbutics.
                                As to how far this bill of rations has been complied with, we
                                    would refer your honorable body to the testimony of the soldiers
                                    herewith appended, in connection with the statements hereinafter
                                    set forth in this report. Your committee are clearly of the
                                    opinion that the rations have exceeded the army regulations, but
                                    that they have not been in accordance with the schedule, in the
                                    report of the Commissary General, heretofore made to this body.
                                    That there has been considerable favoritism toward some
                                    companies, by the employees of the Commissary, but of which we
                                    have traced no knowledge to the Commissary himself, and that
                                    many of the complaints of short allowances of rations are well
                                    founded, and directly tracable to the employees of the
                                    Commissary issuing the rations, and we are also of the opinion
                                    that as a I general thing the companies have fared best, whose
                                    officers have been the most careful and attentive to the wants
                                    of their men, and that much cause of complaint would have been
                                    removed by proper attention of the officers of the companies
                                    complaining.
                            
                            
                                QUALITY OF PROVISIONS.
                                In the careful investigation that we thought necessary to give as
                                    to the quality of provisions, we find that the ground coffee
                                    furnished before the troops were supplied with green coffee and
                                    coffee mills, for the most part was basely adulterated and
                                    almost worthless. When the Cornmissary went into the market for
                                    his first purchase of this article, he found but a limited
                                    supply, the grocery merchants having on hand only a suffi

                        INDIANAPOLIS, MAY 23, 1861.
                        NO. 10.
                    
                    

                        
                            cient amount for the supply of their regular customers, and therefore
                                it was necessary for this officer to make some immediate arrangement
                                for furnishing this article. Mr. B. F. Tuttle, a grocer of this
                                city, informed Mr. Mansur's Assistant that he had an arrangement by
                                which he could get coffee parched, ground and sacked, and as many
                                pounds returned as he furnished of green coffee, and that he would
                                be enabled to furnish the same at 13 1/2 cents per pound, although
                                he had refused to take less than 15 cents for what he had on hand
                                when Mr. Mansur first wanted to purchase. Mr. Mansur accepted this
                                proposition and accordingly Mr. Tuttle employed Mr. Herman Bollman
                                to do the work, and he swears that in roasting, grinding and packing
                                coffee, it looses from 16 to 25 per cent, in weight and that to make
                                up for this loss, and pay him for his labor and expenses of
                                packages, boxes, &c., he put 45 pounds of parched beans in each
                                sack of of green coffee, and that he made for his profits, twenty
                                pounds of green coffee, for each sack of green coffee thus prepared;
                                we are therefore inclined to the opinion that the coffee was much
                                more adulterated from a comparison of the testimony of the soldiers
                                of the worthless character of this article, and their statements in
                                relation to an article of ground coffee, furnished by Mr. Andrew
                                Wallace, manufactured at Columbus, Ohio. The coffee, after being
                                prepared by this man Bollman, was ordered by the Commissary General
                                to be put up in 12, 14 and 16 oz packages, as the Assistant
                                Commissary alleged, for convenience in distributing. The 12 oz.
                                packages were counted out at their actual weight, and the 14 oz. for
                                one pound. We are at a loss for any reason for the adulteration of
                                this coffee, at considerable trouble and expense, when, according to
                                the testimony of witnesses, that it is a well known fact to grocery
                                dealers, that beans and peas ruin and spoil the coffee prepared in
                                this way, nor does it seem that the Commissary or Tuttle made
                                anything by this operation, a criminal practice, and crying evil
                                that should be condemned rather than encouraged. The meat, with the
                                exception of the bulk shoulders, has generally been a fair article.
                                The bulk shoulders referred to have been furnished by the Commissary
                                General out of his own pork-house, and the complaint of the soldiers
                                has been nearly universal of its inferior quality; that a large
                                portion of it was light, and that if was all very salty, not well
                                cured, and generally in a bad condition. There is evidence that
                                other meat was occasionally bad, but we regard this as an
                                unavoidable accident. The beans hare generally been of a poor
                                quality, a good portion of them being entirely worthless. A part of
                                the dried fruit has also been very bad; but this is now remedied,
                                and a good article is being furnished. The testimony shows that
                                there are no further well grounded complaints as to the quality of
                                provisions.
                        
                        
                            THE MANNER OF MAKING PURCHASES.
                            The Commissary General deserves great credit for the zeal and energy
                                which he has displayed in making purchases in his department at the
                                lowest market price, with the single exception of the meat furnished
                                by himself and brother. The testimony shows conclusively that he did
                                all in his power to produce competition in the market, and to
                                purchase all other articles at the lowest cash price; but that he
                                made no offer to any one to furnish pork until he was told by Israel
                                McTaggart that if he did not afford him an opportunity to furnish a
                                part of the pork meat he would expose him in the public prints, when
                                after making some further objections about Mr. Murphey, the
                                inspector, making contracts for the purchase of pork, he consented
                                to purchases being made of other parties. Mr. Mansur had been
                                furnishing his own meatbulk shoulders at 6 cents per pound, and
                                bacon shoulders at 7 cents per pound, when all purchases since have
                                been made for bulk shoulders at 5 12-100 cents per pound, and bacon
                                shoulders at 6 12-100 cents per pound, and the testimony is that
                                plenty of good quality could have been purchased at this price, if
                                not at less rates. It is but just to Mr. Mansur to state that he
                                refused at all times to sell for a less price than he furnished for
                                the State; but he should, instead of remarking as he did to Mr.
                                McTaggart, that the Commissary's duties were hard, and if there was
                                anything to be made by the sales, he had as good a right to make it
                                as any one, he should have used the same dilligence to procure the
                                pork on as good terms for the State as any other article of
                                provision. The meat furnished by Mr. Mansur was weighed by his
                                brother, and no accounts kept except the vouchers and a cash
                                account, therefore we have no means of ascertaining the correctness
                                of the weights. Mr. Mansur's brother swears that it was correctly
                                done.
                        
                        
                            THE ACCOUNTS.
                            We find no errors in the accounts except for the sum of $166 48, for
                                which the proof was not satisfactory, and we are unable to find the
                                person purporting to execute one of these vouchers. We have no doubt
                                but that it is a forgery perpetrated on the Commissary. When the
                                matter was brought to the notice of the Commissary, he withdrew the
                                vouchers numbered 323, 538, 550 1/2, 562, 567  and 597, covering the above amount,
                                for the purpose of investigating the same, and says "unless a full
                                explanation can be had, he will never present them for payment, as
                                he intends the State shall lose nothing thereby." The Commissary has
                                been in the habit of taking from a part of his customers two
                                receipts for payment for the same articles; and at the same time,
                                some of the witnesses say one of these receipts was blank, and eme
                                testify that both were filled up alike. The design of this officer
                                in taking these receipts in this, was undoubtedly that one should be
                                a duplicate for the purpose of retaining in his own hands, and that
                                the original should be filed in the office of the State auditor as a
                                voucher, but the manner of taking them, no indorsement of duplicate
                                being made theron, has given rise to various charges of his designs
                                to bring in double claims. This, with the fact of his withdrawing a
                                part of the vouchers from the Auditor's office, after the committee
                                commenced their investigation, made it necessary for us to examine
                                the books of the persons furnishing provisions, where any such books
                                have been kept, and making a careful comparison of the accounts with
                                the vouchers on file.
                        
                        
                            WHAT IS LEFT UNDONE.
                            We have been unable to investigate the ration receipts, for the
                                reason that there has been no book account kept of them. The
                                receipts are on on file, but the book-keeper of the
                                Department swears that it would take two weeks to exam'ne them; and
                                there are no means of ascertaining what amount of provisions are on
                                hand without making an inventory. There being nothing in the office
                                showing this fact, for these reasons it is impossible for the
                                committee to report whether all of the provisions have been
                                faithfully applied to the use of the troops, but your committee know
                                of no facts tending to impeach the honesty of the Commissary General
                                in this respect. We herewith append a list of the vouchers, with the
                                numbers, date and amount of each, that we have investigated,
                                amounting in all to the sum of $22,798,23 after deducting the
                                numbers specified as not satisfactory. We also append a statement of
                                the amount of money drawn by the Commissary to date of report,
                                amounting to $32,047,55.
                            We also append to this report the testimony of Lieut Jefferson C.
                                Davis, the Government Commissary at this time for this State,
                                showing that he estimates the cost per man for each day at a small
                                fraction over sixteen cents, for regular army rations.
                            We can not close this report without remarking that the haste with
                                which the troops were brought together, and the large amount of
                                provisions necessary for a supply, and the number of inexperienced
                                persons necessarily employed in attending to the troops, rendered
                                mistakes unavoidable, and that no person connected with the
                                department ought to be censured, unless mistakes have occurred
                                through fraud, ignorance or wilful neglect. We herewith append the
                                testimony taken in our investigations. We would however remark that
                                we have, in addition to the testimony taken of the soldiers, visited
                                nearly all the companies and received their statements, which
                                correspond in every particular with the testimony taken. We have
                                also personally inspected the provisions on hand in the Commissary's
                                department, and have come to our conclusions as set forth in this
                                report, from personal inspection as well as from the testimony.
                            
                                All of which we most respectfully submit.

                            Mr. BEESON, from the Committee on Corporations,
                                returned Senator Newcomb's bill, [No. 28] introduced yesterday,
                                recommending passage without amendment.
                            On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, the bill wag considered as engrossed and
                                read the third time.
                            Mr. MARCH, by unanimous consent, amended the bill by adding: "Sec.
                                11. This act may be amended or repealed at the discretion of the
                                Legislature."
                            The bill then finally passed the Senate by yeas 32, nays 4.
                        
                        
                            QUARTERMASTERS AND COMMISSARIES.
                            Mr. MELLETT, by consent, introduced a bill [S. No. 38] entitled "An Act requiring
                                quartermasters and commissaries to execute an official bond, and
                                directing where the same shall be filed," which was read the first
                                time.
                        
                        
                            RAILROAD TAXATION.
                            Mr. CONNER offered a resolution "that the Committee on
                                    Finance be instructed to inquire whether there are any
                                defects in the law for the assessment and collection of taxes,
                                whereby unjust discriminations have been made, and if so, that they
                                report by bill or otherwise."
                            Mr. CONNER. I learn that the Auditor of State has instructed County
                                Auditors to omit railroad property in the assessment-of taxes for
                                township purposes, which is manifestly wrong. All property should be
                                put upon the same footing.
                            The resolution was adopted.

                                reading.
                            Senator Conner's bill [S. 44] was referred to a select committee,
                                which the PRESIDENT makes to consist of Senators Conner, Shields and
                                Mellett.
                            Senator Dickinson's bill [No. 45] was referred to the
                                    Judiciary Committee.
                        
                        
                            ASSESSMENT FOR TAXATION.
                            Mr. SHOEMAKER introduced a bill, [S. No. 46] entitled "An act to amend
                                section 123 and 136 of an act entitled 'an act to provide for the
                                valuation and assessment of the real and personal property, and the
                                collection of taxes in the State of Indiana, for the election of
                                township assessors, and prescribing the duties of assessors,
                                appraisers of real property, county treasurers and auditors, and of
                                the Treasurer and Auditor of State,' approved June 21, 1852, and to
                                repeal sections 138, 139 and 140 of said act;" which was read the
                                first time.
                        
                        
                            CLAIMS FOR SUPPLIES TO TROOPS.
                            Mr. HULL offered the following joint resolution: [S. No. 6.]
                            A joint resolution requiring the Inspector General to audit and allow
                                the claim of Chester Falkland for supplies furnished Capt. B. F.
                                Myers' company in the county of Ripley.
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Be it resolved by the General Assembly of the State of
                                            Indiana:
                                        SEC. 1. The Inspector General be, and he is hereby
                                            required to audit and allow the claim to Chester
                                            Falkland, of the county, of Ripley, for supplies
                                            furnished the company of Capt. B. F. Myers, of said
                                            county, which said company was retained and quartered in
                                            said county of Ripley, in pursuance to the instructions
                                            of the Adjutant General.
                                        SEC. 2. That it shall be the duty of said Inspector
                                            General to investigate said claim and allow the same,
                                            provided said allowance shall not exceed per capita, more than the cost of keeping
                                            troops at either of the camps at the Capital.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. HAMILTON moved to amend so as to insert the companies of Captains
                                Humphrey and Link, of the county of Allen.
                            Mr. CARNAHAN moved to indefinitely postpone the bill and
                                amendment.
                            Mr. SLACK. Capt. Myers was told to rendezvous his troops, and supply
                                them the same as they would have been supplied had they been here at
                                the Capital. Under these circumstances the claim is unquestionably
                                correct, and they should be paid the same that it costs to keep the
                                troops here, for they were detained by virtue of the order of the
                                Commander-in-Chief of the army. I understand the object of the mover
                                of the resolution to be to have the resolution referred to the
                                    Committee on Claims.
                            Mr. CARNAHAN. I have no objection to its going to a committee, and I
                                will withdraw my motion.
                            Mr. HAMILTON. I do not offer any factious opposition to the
                                resolution. The Adjutant General ordered the company from Allen
                                county not to come till further orders, but to hold the company in
                                readiness. They were kept three weeks at the expense of the city,
                                and I shall insist upon my amendment, including the companies of
                                Capts. Humphrey and Link, of the county of Allen.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. I shall move to amend by including Capt. Marsh's
                                company, from Fayette.
                            Mr. MILLER. Capt. Bailey's company, of Plymouth, was held in the same
                                way as the companies of the Senator from Alien [Mr. Hamilton,] and
                                were finally ordered to be disbanded. I suppose this case to be as
                                meritorious as any other, and I move to amend by inserting Capt.
                                Bailey's company.
                            The PRESIDENT. There is an amendment to an amendment now pending. The
                                amendment proposed by the gentleman from St. Joseph [Mr. Miller,] is
                                out of order at this time.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. I will incorporate the company named by the Senator
                                from St. Joseph, in my amendment; and also the company suggested
                                    [soto voce] by the Senator from Cass, [Mr.
                                Dehart.
                            On motion of Mr. WILLIAMS the joint resolution and pending amendments
                                were laid on the table.
                            And then the Senate adjourned.
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            THURSDAY, May 23, 1861.
                        
                        The House met at 9 o'clock. On motion of Mr HAYES, the reading of the
                            journal of yesterday was dispensed with.
                        
                            EXEMPTION OF THE LEGION.
                            Mr. ORR submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Military Affairs inquire into the
                                            expediency or propriety of exempting from labor on the
                                            public highways all  the members of the Indiana Legion, who will drill not
                                            less than twelve days in each year; and that said
                                            committee report by bill or otherwise.
                                    
                                
                            
                            He observed that it was obligatory on all members of the Legion to
                                drill twelve times a year, and it seemed proper that some exemption
                                should be made for this service.
                            The resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            ARMING THE VOLUNTEERS.
                            Mr.WARRUM submitted a joint resolution with reference to arming the
                                Indiana volunteers mustered into the service of the United States,
                                entitled a joint resolution instructing our Senators and
                                Representatives in Congress to use all lawful means to procure
                                rifles and other first class arms for the Indiana troops enlisted
                                into the service of the United States.
                            Mr. McLEAN. I move to refer the resolutions to the Committee
                                    on Military Affairs. I think there is something in
                                them that ought not to be passed - especially the last.
                            Mr. WARRUM. I do not think it is right to send these men out with old
                                smooth-bored, single-sighted muskets, to go against the rebel army
                                armed with the Sharpe, Minie and Enfield guns.
                            Mr. ORR hoped the resolution would pass. He saw nothing in it
                                requiring the reference to a committee.
                            Mr. WARRUM. It was like marching sheep to the slaughter, to send our
                                men into the field with their present arms.
                            Mr. FISHER. The second resolution went too far. Volunteers ushered
                                into the service of the United States were beyond the Governor's
                                control. He was in favor of the preamble and first resolution. He
                                moved to strike out that last I resolution.
                            Mr. WARRUM. It would apply to the State troops.
                            Mr. CRAIN. That would amount to nothing. Our agent would look to
                                that. The United States arms were needed for the United States
                                service. No doubt the troops in the service of the United States
                                would be amply armed before being brought into the field. The second
                                resolution was simply preposterous.
                            The SPEAKER. Don't it amount to rebellion?
                            Mr. HEFFREN (in his seat). "Secession."
                            Mr. WARRUM. The resolutions were offered under a request from the
                                officers and men of the 7th regiment, now expecting to march on
                                Harper's Ferry.
                            Mr. CRAIN seconded the motion for reference.
                            Mr. GRESHAM considered the reference unnecessary. He moved to strike
                                out all except that portion instructing our Congressmen to give
                                their influence toward procuring first class arms for Indiana troops
                                in the service of the United States.
                            The motion to refer the resolution to the Committee on
                                    Military Affairs was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            EXECUTION STAY LAW.
                            Mr. HOLCOMB presented the petition of Wm. Stanley and others,
                                citizens of Gibson and Warrick counties, asking for a law to prevent
                                the sale of property on execution for twelve months - that subject
                                being the special order for two o'clock this day.
                        
                        
                            SEATS WITHIN THE BAR.
                            Mr. HAYES submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Military officers
                                            stationed at present at Camp Morton or at other places
                                            in this city be permitted to occupy seats within the bar
                                            of this House during the present session.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. DOBBINS proposed to add "all the soldiers."
                            On the motion of Mr. PROSSER it was laid on the table.
                        
                        
                            LEGISLATIVE INSTRUCTIONS TO CONGRESSMEN.
                            Mr. JONES, of Tippecanoe, from the committee to whom it was referred
                                on the 11th inst., returned his joint resolution of instruction to
                                our Senators and Representatives in Congress, with an amendment by
                                way of substitute.
                            Mr. HEFFREN moved to recommit the resolutions with instruction to
                                correct the resolving clause - The Senate was a part of the General
                                Assembly.
                            Mr. JONES. The subject was made the special order for this day, at 10
                                o'clock.
                            The resolutions were again referred to the Select Committee, and on
                                motion of Mr. Speaker Allen, (Mr. Sherman in the Chair) Mr. Crain
                                was added to the Committee.
                        
                        
                            SANCTION OF THE MILITIA LAW.
                            Mr. WARRUM introduced a bill [47] supplementary to the late militia
                                act approved the llth inst. [It proposes a tax of one dollar a year
                                on all the non-acting or sedentary militia of the State for the
                                benefit of the Military fund.]
                            Mr. WOODHULL could see no necessity for changing the entire spirit of
                                our militia law. The system was voluntary, and he preferred that.
                                There was also a constitutional objection - the same that was
                                exhibited yesterday. He moved to reject the bill.
                            Mr. HOLCOMB. The motion was discourteous. The bill was necessary to
                                give efficiency to the militia system. The money tax it required was
                                in the nature of-an equivalent for the time that should be spent in
                                mustering.
                            Mr. FRASIER. It was not right that those who are willing to take upon
                                themselves the burden of the military, should therefore bear, the
                                whole burden. All were equally protected by the military arm, and
                                the expense and burden should be borne by all.
                            Mr. ORR. His bill yesterday required that all able-bodied men between
                                eighteen and forty-five should muster or pay a fine. Its principle
                                was the same as this bill.
                            Mr. GRESHAM. To require all to go into the legion was to suppose that
                                the State would furnish arms for all, which the present legislation
                                could not contemplate. More men would come in than could be
                                furnished with arms.
                            Mr. HAYES and Mr. EDSON referred to the sixth section of the
                                Constitution, which requires that those seeking exemption from
                                military duty shall pay an equivalent.
                            Mr. HOLCOMB and others insisted that the bill was not aimed at
                                Quakers.
                            Mr. WOODHULL withdrew the motion to reject.
                            
                            Mr. ORR made an ineffectual motion to suspend the rules for a motion
                                that the bill be read the second time now.
                            The bill was then passed to the second reading to-morrow.
                        
                        
                            PER DIEM OF MEMBERS.
                            Mr. HEFFREN submitted the following:
                            WHEREAS, By joint resolution of the General Assembly, a recess of
                                about ten days was agreed to and both Houses took such a recess to a
                                day certain. And WHEREAS, by a resolution which passed both the
                                House and Senate, the presiding officers thereof, together with the
                                secretaries thereof, should certify to the Auditor of State the per diem and mileage of members of the General
                                Assembly; and,
                            WHEREAS, The Auditor of State has refused to draw his warrant upon
                                the Treasurer for the per diem of members upon the certificate of
                                the proper officers of the House and Senate, alledging as a reason
                                therefor that he had taken official notice that the General Assembly
                                had taken a recess and would not draw such warrants as the
                                resolution of this General Assembly directed, therefore be it
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, (the Senate concurring
                                            therein,) That the Auditor of State be directed to draw
                                            his warrant upon the Treasurer of State for the per diem of members as certified by
                                            the presiding officers thereof.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. HEFFREN. The Auditor of State acts as though he considered
                                himself an autocrat. I understand that he takes official notice that
                                the General Assembly was not in session during the recess. It would
                                be just as competent for him to take official notice of the recess
                                for Sunday. But, sir, I understand that he is not authorized to go
                                behind the certificate of the presiding officers of the two houses
                                in the matter of the per diem of members of the
                                Legislature. I desire to have no quarrel with the Auditor. I simply
                                wish to see this resolution passed, and then see whether the Auditor
                                will refuse to obey it. I will say also that it is the request of
                                the Auditor that this matter should be brought before the
                                Legislature.
                            M. GRESHAM. I think, so far as our per diem is
                                concerned, if we are entitled to our pay at all, this resolution
                                will make our right no better than it is. Again, I am unwilling to
                                pass the resolution, or take any other action whatever here, simply
                                to gratify the whim of a public officer, in a case where our right
                                is clear.
                            Mr. PROSSER thought the shortest way to settle the matter was to pass
                                the resolution. He did not care whether it should gratify the
                                Auditor or not. It will gratify us.
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair understands that the Auditor refuses to honor
                                the certificate of the Chair - the Auditor taking official notice
                                that we were not in session so many days as called for by the
                                certificate.
                            Mr. McLEAN had told the Auditor that he had better get the opinion of
                                the Attorney General; but the Auditor told him that the opinion of
                                the Attorney General would not be conclusive on him, and that a
                                resolution of the General Assembly would be better. Still the
                                Auditor had left the impression on Mr. McL's mind that he would
                                bring the matter to the attention of the Attorney General.
                            The resolution was adopted.
                            Mr. BRETT introduced a bill [48] to amend sections 75, 78, 79, 94, 95, 104, 142 and
                                143 of the valuation and appraisement law.
                            On the motion of Mr. HEFFREN, (the rules being suspended for the
                                purpose,) the bill was read the first and second times by title.
                            On motion of Mr. BRETT, it was referred to a select committee of
                                five, and the Speaker appointed Messrs. Brett, Black, Lane, Crain
                                and Hopkins.
                        
                        
                            HUNTINGTON COMMON PLEAS.
                            On the motion of Mr. JENKINSON, the Common Pleas bill [S. 20] which passed the House
                                without amendment, yesterday, was taken through the processes of
                                reconsideration, and amended, by changing the times of holding said
                                court in Huntingdon county; and then, as thus amended, it was passed
                                the third and last reading-yeas 76, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            SURGEON EXAMINERS.
                            On motion by Mr. FISHER, the consideration of his bill [46] was
                                resumed at the point where it was left off when the House adjourned
                                yesterday - the question being on Mr. Stotsenberg's motion to refer
                                to the Committee on Military Affairs.
                            Mr. NEBEKER made the point, that the bill had been ordered to be
                                engrossed.
                            Mr. KENDRICK spoke in terms of high general commendation of the
                                members of the proposed board of examiners. They were his personal
                                friends, and his remarks yesterday applied merely to the influences
                                that would surround them in their official action. He insisted that
                                the bill was not engrossed.
                            Mr. FRAZIER appealed to the journal, and it sustained Mr.
                                Kendrick.
                            Mr. SHERMAN spoke to the merits of the bill. It would operate
                                unfairly at this late day. It was probably to put favorites into the
                                few places that remain. If the bill had been introduced last winter
                                he would have supported it. Now it would operate to introduce young
                                men into those places, to the exclusion of the older and really
                                better qualified members of the profession. He admitted all that was
                                claimed for the reputation of the proposed board, but he declared
                                that he would not hazard his own professional reputation, (if he
                                were an applicant,) by submitting himself to be examined by that
                                board. There was already a United States board of examination for
                                the medical staff in the army of United States, and he described the
                                thoroughness of the examinations there. There was ground to assume
                                "a negro in the wood pile." No physician, without weeks of time to
                                prepare for it, would hazard his reputation by submitting to an
                                examination before the proposed board.
                            On motion by Mr. HEFFREN, the motion to refer was laid on the
                                table.
                            Mr. FRAZIER made an ineffectual demand for the previous question.
                            Mr. HEFFREN proposed to amend the bill by substituting "Dr. John
                                Sloan, of New Albany," in place of "Dr. Dunlap."
                            He considered that all the medical knowledge  and skill in the State was not
                                confined to Indianapolis. With respect to political parties, if
                                there was anything in that, Dunlap was a Democrat, and Sloan was of
                                the same political faith.
                            Mr. FISHER stated the reason which induced him to confine the
                                selection of the board to this city. He desired that the bill should
                                devolve no expense upon the State. Being all here, they could all be
                                readily convened, &c.
                            Mr. GIFFORD considered the proposed board entirely unnecessary. There
                                were twelve places to be filled and about six hundred applicants. He
                                proposed to tax these applicants three dollars a piece for
                                examination. He was willing to trust the matter with the government.
                                The sixteenth regiment had already signified their choice of
                                surgeons by its captains. These were simpler processes than
                                admission on the certificate of a board.
                            Mr. FISHER did not think that so many us one hundred applicants would
                                be examined.
                            Mr. GIFFORD. Still it was an unnecessary expense. He endorsed the
                                remarks of Mr. Sherman.
                            Mr. SLOAN proposed to insert the name of "Dr. David G. Stewart" in
                                place of "Dr. Jameson;" which, not being strictly in order, he
                                withdrew.
                            Mr. PROSSER replied to the argument in opposition to the bill. These
                                commissioners were themselves old men, and likely to be well
                                qualified to decide as between the fitness of young physicians and
                                old practitioners. He was distinctly opposed to favoritism, and also
                                to incompetency in connection with these appointments.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS moved that the further consideration of the bill and
                                pending amendment be indefinitely postponed.
                            Mr. NEBEKER demanded the previous question upon this motion, and
                                there was a second.
                            Mr. HEFFREN demanded the yeas and nays on the main question, viz:
                                Shall the bill be indefinitely postponed? and the vote resulted -
                                yeas 51, nays 28.
                            So the bill was indefinitely postponed.
                        
                        
                            INSTRUCTIONS TO INDIANA CONGRESSMAN.
                            Mr. BINGHAM, from the select committee to which was referred Mr.
                                Jones of Tippecanoe's joint resolution [No. 7] of Instruction to
                                Indiana Congressmen, with an amendment proposing still another
                                substitute.
                            It is as follows:
                            WHEREAS, an armed rebellion now distracts and disturbs the peace and
                                quiet of the Government of the United States, and in a portion of
                                the States comprising said Union the execution of the laws thereof
                                have been resisted.
                            AND WHEREAS, such disturbance is treasonable in its nature, and
                                should at once be quelled by the exercise of the military powers of
                                the Government.
                            AND WHEREAS, it is desirable to know the views of the Senators and
                                Congressmen representing this State, and to advise them of the
                                wishes of their constituents, therefore,
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Be it Resolved by the General Assembly of
                                                the State of Indiana, That our Senators be
                                            instructed and they are hereby directed, and our members
                                            of Congress requested to vote all needful aid in men and
                                            money that the General Government may require to
                                            suppress said rebellion prompt effectually and
                                            completely.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Be it further Resolved, That should any
                                            of said Senators or Representatives sympathise with
                                            those engaged in said rebellion, and be disinclined to
                                            vote men or money to aid in the suppression thereof,
                                            they are hereby requested to resign their seats and
                                            return to the people the opportunity of filling their
                                            places with representative men who have the will and
                                            courage of patriots to stand by the Government as it
                                            came from the hands of the men who bequeathed it to
                                            us.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Be it further Resolved, That the
                                            Governor of this State send to each of our Senators and
                                            members of Congress a copy of these resolutions, and
                                            that they each severally are hereby requested' to
                                            respond to the same in some public manner.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. HEFFREN. What is to be gained? Who is to be benefitted by this
                                resolution?
                            Mr. BINGHAM. I hope the State will be benefitted. The simple object
                                is to call upon certain gentlemen who seem to have no settled
                                whereabouts to show their hands.
                            Mr. HEFFREN, (In his seat.) If they show their hands, we'll see them
                                soon enough. They might eucher us. They might hold four aces.
                            Mr. ROBERTS. If they do, we hold the "pot."
                            Mr. DOBBINS. I would be very glad to know whether these public men
                                are going to be found with the people in this contest - whether they
                                are with those who are in favor of the Union, or whether they are
                                going to sympathize with those who are trying to overthrown it.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, that there is one man in this
                                House who can believe that any one of our Senators or
                                Representatives in Congress are so bad as to require us to pass a
                                resolution of this kind. Have we got traitors in Indiana? [A VOICE.
                                "Yes."] The gentleman says yes; but I apprehend that the treason
                                does not come entirely from the source intended to be insinuated. If
                                we know of no reason why suspicion should attach to any member of
                                Congress from this State, then let us wait till something of this
                                sort shall be ascertained and certified. Until something is done I
                                take it to be an insult to those honorable men whom the people have
                                selected to represent them in the Congress of the United States, to
                                pass such a resolution as this. Sir, let us clear our own skirts,
                                and let the people take care of their Representatives. I do riot
                                believe that there will be a solitary man that will assemble in the
                                Congress of the United States on the fourth of July next, but will
                                stand up for the support of the government. Taking these
                                considerations, and seeing no necessity, no good reason for the
                                proposition, I shall vote against it.
                            Mr. CRAIN. I do see a direct necessity for the passage of this
                                resolution. There are certain men in this State who have made public
                                assertions which I want them to retract.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. (In his seat.) Suppose they don't do it?
                            Mr. CRAIN. Then I want them to show their hands. If we have a member
                                of Congress who is in sentiment
                                and sympathy with rebels and traitors, I want to know where he
                                stands.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Has this body a right to call on a Representative in
                                Congress to resign?
                            Mr. CRAIN. I do not know that we have such a constitutional right any
                                more than we plight have as citizens of the State of Indiana. But I
                                undertake to say that all citizens of Indiana have a right to know
                                what their Senators and members of Congress are going to do, and
                                where they stand in a crisis like the present. And we have a
                                declaration of one of our Senators, in a speech delivered before two
                                thousand men, to the effect that he would not vote either men or
                                money to carry on this war.
                            Mr. SMITH of Bartholomew. Has he not made a satisfactory explanation
                                of that speech?
                            Mr. CRAIN. He has not explained it to my satisfaction, nor to the
                                satisfaction of the people. He has attempted to get out of it in an
                                improper way - a way which leaves it so that I would like to hear
                                from him; and I would like to hear from all our members of Congress.
                                We are all required to come out and declare our position. These
                                resolutions do not require anything but that is honorable. We ask
                                them to come before the country and say where they stand, so that
                                the world may see we are one people.
                            Mr. THOMAS. Mr. Lane, one of our Senators, authorizes me to say that
                                he is on hand here, And ready to reply to that resolution.
                            Mr. CRAIN. And I want them all to reply.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. What good will it do?
                            Mr. CRAIN. I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, what good it will do. I
                                thought when we came together in extra session here that if we
                                organized the two houses of the General Assembly as a unit, without
                                reference to party affiliations, it would carry out a good influence
                                amongst the people at large; and now I want this same influence to
                                come out from our members of Congress. The word of a member of
                                Congress has power in it; and, when properly directed, it would have
                                a mighty influence upon the traitors who are banded together for the
                                destruction of this Union. I know that the Southern people have been
                                deceived in their estimates of the people of the Northern States. I
                                want to set them right and let them know that the people and the
                                representatives of Indiana all stand one way. I can not see how any
                                member on this floor can vote against this resolution.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. I have no doubt that it is eminently proper and
                                right for the General Assembly, by representations of the people
                                here, to instruct our Senators and Representatives to vote for men
                                and money for the purpose of prosecuting this war for the support of
                                the Government, and for sustaining the army and the flag. There can
                                be no doubt about that, and I cannot agree with the gentlemen from
                                Washington and Harrison as to this objection. There certainly can be
                                no valid objection to the passage of this resolution. The right of
                                instruction is guaranteed to the people; and neither Senator nor
                                Representative should object to its exercise at any time. But I
                                cannot see any occasion for going further than the resolution to
                                instruct. And when the gentleman from Parke admits that they will
                                all come out, right, I ask, what, is the use of adding the second
                                resolution, it is nothing more nor less than a threat? It will be
                                time enough to threaten when men come to deserve censure. I say, Mr.
                                Speaker, it is not right thus to couple a resolution of instruction
                                with a resolution supposing that our public men may, some time in
                                the future, become guilty, and deserve our censure. I think that
                                second resolution ought to be stricken out. I think it is best for
                                us to assume what the gentleman from Parke admits, that they will
                                all come out right. Let us tell them what we want, and let them take
                                it for duty. Farther than that I think we ought not to go.
                            Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. Speaker, can the gentleman from Floyd say, on his
                                responsibility as a Representative, that Jesse D. Bright is doing
                                his duty?
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. I know nothing about what he is doing. I am
                                solicitous chiefly now that we here shall do our duty - our whole
                                duty, and no more. And for the purpose of testing the sense of the
                                House, I move that the resolution be adopted, with the further
                                amendment, striking out the second section.
                            Mr. ROBERTS moved to lay the amendment on the table, but afterwards
                                withdrew the motion.
                            Mr. HEFFREN demanded the yeas and nays.
                            Mr. PROSSER was sorry to see opposition to instruction of our
                                Senators. We have the right to know where our Representatives stand.
                                He also would like to know where Jesse P. Bright stands? For the man
                                thai could take the course he had taken on the Kansas-Nebraska
                                matter was near to go over and join Jeff. Davis' army. It was most
                                clearly, our right to give these instructions, and make this
                                demand.
                            Mr. SMITH of Bartholomew showed how there might he honest differences
                                of opinion, as upon the amount of money that should be appropriated
                                for State defense, etc. He would not charge treason for a difference
                                of opinion. Still, he also desired to hear from Mr. Bright, and
                                believed that when he did speak, it would be for the Union, as
                                distinctly as any of us.
                            Mr. ROBERTS, and others, now insisted on the motion to lay the
                                amendment on the table, and it was agreed to.
                            The question recurring on the adoption of the joint resolutions, as
                                amended by the Special Committee, and it was
                                urged by the previous question.
                            Mr. Heffren's demand for the yeas and nays was now seconded, and the
                                vote was reported - yeas 82, nays 2.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG explaining that he should waive his objection.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Bartholomew, would vote for the resolution simply
                                because there was more in them than he was in favor of.
                            Mr. Colling of Adams, present, and refusing  to vote. Messrs. Combs and Heffren
                                voting nay.
                            So the joint resolution was adopted.
                            The House then took a recess till 2 o'clock P. M.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            Mr. CASON, from the select committee appointed to investigate the
                                commissariat, submitted a report, in writing, stating that the
                                testimony does not accompany the report, because the Clerk is
                                copying it.
                            These conclusions of the committee are printed in our Senate report
                                of to-day.
                            Mr. DOBBINS stated his information from different reliable sources,
                                that the soldiers were obliged to go to bed hungry.
                            Mr. HEFFREIST. The Legislature could not make any order in regard to
                                what belonged to the United States. The committee made no
                                recommendation. But the soldiers had not been well treated, in the
                                matter of provisions, and groceries supplied. He recited the cases
                                of mingling beans with coffee, light weights, &c., and gave his
                                own opinion that the General Assembly ought to recommend the removal
                                of the Commissary General.
                            On the motion of Mr. STOTSENBERG, the report was laid on the table -
                                passed over informally.

                            
                                THE RELIEF BILLS.
                                The SPEAKER announced the special order, viz.: the consideration
                                    of the bills numbered 15, 23, 27 and 28.
                                Mr. FRASIER made an ineffectual motion to refer the several bills
                                    to the Committee on the Judiciary, with
                                    instructions to report one bill.
                                Mr. Moss' bill [15] to amend the 420th section of the general
                                    practice act coming first under consideration -
                                Mr. FISHER moved that it be indefinitely postponed, desiring to
                                    reach another bill in this order for which he would be willing
                                    to vote understood to be Mr. Stotsenberg's [27] real estate
                                    redemption bill.
                                Mr. CRAIN did not intend that any of these bills should pass, if
                                    he could help it. When a state interposed legislation against
                                    the collection of debts, it always resulted in depressing the
                                    general financial credit of the State. He referred to Kentucky
                                    as an example. As for the other bill - to say that property
                                    shall sell at two-thirds, would be to suspend collections, and
                                    the banks could not sustain themselves. The weak banks would go
                                    down, and the loss would full on the people at largo. The best
                                    way to preserve the State credit, was to insist on the payment
                                    of all debts as contracted.
                                Mr. SMITH, of Bartholomew, opposed the bill because its operation
                                    would be unequal, as between those holding only personal
                                    property, and those holding real property.
                                Mr. DAVIS. In 1840 we had a law similar to what this bill
                                    proposed, and it did riot affect the general credit of the
                                    State. Such a law was demanded by his constituents. It was
                                    demanded lately at a public meeting in his county, with hardly a
                                    dissenting voice, and he should vote for it.
                                Mr. PACKARD. The more he examined this subject, and the farther
                                    he had advised with his constituents, his mind was the more
                                    confirmed in the opinion that there should be no change in the
                                    laws for the collection of debts. The argument for the southern
                                    counties was that the Southern market was cut off. Were there
                                    not other markets than Kentucky? He commended the people of the
                                    southern counties to the markets found for the produce of other
                                    portions of the State. Such a law as this would oppress the
                                    poorer classes. The proposition was also in the face of a
                                    constitutional principle - that debts shall be collected
                                    according to the laws under which they were contracted. He would
                                    have the House consider the remarks of the gentleman from
                                    Parke.
                                Mr. HEFFREN. The indebtedness of our counties was in Louisville
                                    and New Albany - generally under the sum of $500, (for which,
                                    collection may be made through the United States Court).
                                    Kentucky had cut off our right to collect what they owe us, and
                                    his people wanted the same relief from this Legislature. He did
                                    not understand the cause of the depreciation of Kentucky's
                                    credit to be in her financial policy. Her credit was gone
                                    because of her secession her political policy. He should vote
                                    against postponement. He hoped some such bill would be passed.
                                    He did not believe the House would determine to refuse this
                                    relief. He did not believe the hearts of members were turned to
                                    stone, or that they would take the hazard of a popular
                                    resistance to legal process for the collection of debts,
                                    etc.
                                Mr. FISHER said he believed this law, if passed, would be
                                    declared unconstitutional and void. The bill, No. 23, (Mr.
                                    Stotsen-berg's) was merely to extend the time for the return of
                                    execution, and would be sustained by the people as well us the
                                    courts, he supposed. He was in favor of the bills numbered 23
                                    and 28 - the latter being
                                    for the redemption of real estate sold under execution.
                                Mr. EDSON showed the difference between the condition of trade in
                                    the southern counties and other counties in the State. They must
                                    have relief in the southern counties, or their property will
                                    mainly have to go to their creditors into the hands of the
                                    Shylocks. He answered objections. He believed that in less than
                                    six months members from the northern counties would find that
                                    their own people needed this measure much more than they now
                                    seem to think. He also considered and feared, that if relief was
                                    not afforded in this way it would provoke resistance and
                                    insubordination to the legal process for the collection of
                                    debts.
                                Mr. GRESHAM took the argument, that the passage of such a law
                                    would disparage the general credit of the State; and this should
                                    be considered gravely at a time when the State of Indiana was
                                    going into the market to borrow two millions of dollars. He
                                    should even vote  against
                                    the measures of relief proposed by the gentleman from Floyd.
                                    This bill was probably demanded in the counties of Floyd and
                                    Vandeburgh. But he had himself received letters from New Albany
                                    making strong appeals against all these measures.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG. Were not those letters from persons engaged in
                                    banking?
                                Mr.GRESHAM. He did not know. He had seen men from Vandeburgh, and
                                    from Perry, who were also opposed to these measures.
                                Mr. DOBBINS supported the bill, and replied to the objections of
                                    Mr. Crain and Mr. Packard. He voted for this measure of relief
                                    wilh the assurance that it would benefit the credit of the State
                                    abroad. It would enable the people to pay their taxes.
                                Mr. WOODHULL said his constituents desired nothing of this kind,
                                    and he could not believe that bankruptcy in the southern
                                    counties to be so imminent and universal as represented in some
                                    quarters. When he had concluded -
                                Mr. ROBBINS demanded the previous question, and there was a
                                    second.
                                Mr. HEFFREN demanded the yeas and nays, and the same being
                                    ordered and taken resulted yeas 58, nays 29.
                                So the bill was indefinitely postponed.
                                On motion of Mr. FISHER, Mr. Stotsenberg's bill, [23] to amend
                                    the 412th section of the practice act so as to extend the time
                                    for the return of executions and the time for advertisements
                                    upon them, was taken up.
                                Mr. FRAZIER moved that it be indefinitely postponed, and
                                    proceeded to show that this bill was even more objectionable
                                    than the other extending the stay to the debtor without giving
                                    the undoubted security which was provided for in Mr. Moss' bill.
                                    And it would be worse also for the credit of the Stale abroad.
                                    He replied to the argument of Mr. Packard, that stay laws were
                                    unconstitutional. It was the first time he had ever heard such
                                    an argument seriously presented. He was willing to support an
                                    appraisement law, requiring property to sell for half the
                                    appraised value. He would not go for a repeal of the waiver of
                                    the two-thirds valuation law. And he could not go for the
                                    redemption law, for the reason given by the gentleman from
                                    Bartholomew.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG demanded the previous question, and there was a
                                    second.
                                The yeas and nays on the main question, viz. shall the bill be
                                    indefinitely postponed? resulted - yeas 54, nays 27.
                                So the bill was indefinitely postponed.
                                On motion of Mr. STOTSENBERG, Mr. Williams' bill, [27] providing
                                    for relief by valuation and appraisement on execution and
                                    judgment on all contracts hereafter made, was taken up.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG proposed to amend, by striking out "two thirds"
                                    the valuation, and inserting "one half" in lieu.
                                Mr. HEFFREN moved the indefinite postponement of the bill and
                                    pending amendment.
                                Mr. PACKARD demanded the previous question, and under its force
                                    the yeas and nays were taken and reported on the main question
                                    yeas 41, nays 40.
                                So the bill was indefinitely postponed.
                                On motion of Mr. STOTSENBERG, his bill, [28] providing for the
                                    redemption of real estate, [within one year from the day of sale
                                    under execution] was taken up.
                                The bill having been read -
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG moved that the bill be be ordered to
                                    engrossment and the third reading now.
                                Under the pressure of the previous question the motion was agreed
                                    to, and the bill was read the third time.
                                Mr. WOODS proposed to re-commit the bill, with instructions to
                                    strike out the words, "when redeemed the purchaser shall have
                                    the growing crops, and shall not be accountable for rents and
                                    profits, but he shall account for waste;" and insert these
                                    words, "when redeemed the purchaser shall have the rents
                                    accruing from such lands, and he shall be accountable for
                                    waste." If this is a relief bill, I think the purchaser should
                                    not have the crops.
                                Mr. SMITH, of Bartholomew, moved the indefinite postponement of
                                    the bill and pending amendment.
                                Mr. HEFFREN. I look upon this bill as giving another chance to
                                    men that have money to make 10 per cent, on it. Therefore I
                                    shall vote to postpone it.
                                Mr. FORD. I understand that it gives to poor men who have lost
                                    their land a chance to get it back by paying 10 per cent.
                                    Therefore I shall vote against postponement.
                                The previous question again forced the vote and it was reported -

                                So the subject was not postponed, and the question recurred on
                                    Mr. Wood's amendment.
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN (Mr. McLean in the chair) proposed to amend the
                                    amendment by adding to the instructions these words: "The
                                    Sheriff, at the time of sale, shall execute to the purchases a
                                    certificate of purchase, which shall entitle him to a deed in
                                    twelve months, if the land is not redeemed. Also, that in all
                                    cases the Sheriff shall have the property appraised, and if it
                                    sell for two-thirds the appraised value there shall be no
                                    redemption." As far as redemption laws are concerned it is
                                    eminently fit and proper to have one at all times in force, and
                                    not merely in times of pecuniary embarrassment. And there are
                                    few States in this  Union
                                    that have not got them. In most of the States they have a law
                                    that real estate shall be appraised by the Sheriff, and if the
                                    sale come up to a certain proportion of tho valuation, then the
                                    sale is absolute; if rioL, then the property is redeemable. I do
                                    not suppose (hat any gentleman can assume that this bill can
                                    impair the credit of the State. There is no new principle in it.
                                    And it would, in my judgment, afford to the people of this State
                                    all the relief they desire. It would give them twelve months to
                                    redeem their property, if it should not sell for the required
                                    ratio or proportion of the valuation. No person could desire to
                                    be relieved from a sale where his property had brought a fair
                                    price. I hope the bill will be recommitted, and that the bill
                                    reported will embrace at length, and in due form, the provisions
                                    I have indicated, and so allow the redemption in one year, by
                                    the payment of 10 per cent, interest. With these provisions in
                                    the bill I think all the relief will be afforded by it to the
                                    people of the State which they can require at the hands of' this
                                    Legislature.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG suggested that the instructions be extended so as
                                    to require the committee to report to-morrow morning at 10
                                    o'clock.
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN acquiesced.
                                The bill was accordingly recommitted with the proposed
                                    instructions.
                                The House then adjourned.

                        On motion by Mr. LINE, it was -

                                        the report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction,
                                        presented on yesterday with such suggestions by the
                                        committee as may be proper, with a view to printing the same
                                        and that a sufficient number of copies be printed to furnish
                                        the auditor ot each county with one; and the school examiner
                                        of each county with one, and that the Superintendent of
                                        Public Instruction be authorized to forward at the earliest
                                        day possible a copy of said report to each of the above
                                        named officers.
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            AN EXTRA CLERK.
                            On motion by Mr. CLAYPOOL it was -
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the principal Secretary
                                            of this Senate be allowed to employ an additional
                                            assistant clerk for the remainder of the session.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            THE COMMISSARIAT.
                            On motion by Mr. JOHNSTON it was -
                            Ordered, That 200 copies of the report of the joint
                                select committee upon the Commissary General's Department be printed

                            A STAY LAW.
                            Mr. WHITE presented a remonstrance from one hundred citizens of
                                Montgomery county against the passage of a stay law, which was
                                read.
                            Mr. WHITE. That is the sentiment of the people of Montgomery county.
                                I will have it referred to the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary.
                            This motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER presented a remonstrance from citizens of Adams county
                                upon the same subject, which was also read and referred to the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary.
                        
                        
                            ARMS FOR THE MILITIA.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER, from the Committee on Finance
                                returned his bill S. No. 9 - see page 22 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE
                                REPORTS - recommending that the same be laid on the table as the
                                subject matter of the bill has been provided for by another bill
                                already passed by the General Assembly.
                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            THE PROPERTY OF VOLUNTEERS.
                            Mr. SLACK, from the Judiciary Committee returned
                                Senator Ray's bill S. No. 15 - see page 36 of these Reports -
                                recommending that it lie on the table.
                            Mr. RAY moved to concur in the report, with the following amendment,
                                viz.:
                            "And that all the property, real and personal, of those who may have
                                or may hereafter volunteer and be mustered into the active military
                                service of this State or of the United States shall be exempt from
                                execution during the time that such volunteers may be in actual
                                service, and when so amended to recommend its passage, and strike
                                out the recommendation to lie on the table."
                            Mr. RAY. This bill, sir, seems to meet with the opposition of a
                                majority of the Judiciary Committee; but I desire
                                to take the sense of the Senate upon the merits of the proposition.
                                I think it is meritorious, and I think it is free from technical,
                                legal objections. The bill proposes, in substance, to exempt the
                                property of volunteers who have gone into the State or Federal
                                service, during the time of their service. The probabilities are
                                that while this bill will not operate beneficially to the majority,
                                I have no doubt there are a great many that it will benefit and
                                protect. I think it is doing as little as the State of Indiana can
                                do to exempt the property of the volunteer during the time he is in
                                actual service. The question is whether this can be legally done. It
                                might be said a stay law would be void ; violating a contract
                                between parties. The theory is that stay and appraisement laws are
                                part of a contract and they say a stay law or appraisement law of
                                to-day enters into a contract of to-day between the parties of
                                to-day. That is, in contemplation of law, parties have in view all
                                existing laws when making a contract. That is the ground upon which
                                it is said it would be illegal to pass stay laws or modify the
                                appraisement laws. We have some decisions to the effect that a
                                material modification of the appraisement laws would not be legal.
                                We have some, also, that look to declaring that stay laws are all so
                                material in the collection of debt that they enter into the terms of
                                the contract in contemplation of law. I believe it is well settled
                                that the exemption law is held 
                                as purely remedial. I believe, while we are not in the habit of
                                changing our appraisement stay laws so as to effect existing
                                contracts and judgments, we are allowed to modify as we please our
                                exemption law. Senators will keep the distinction in view as between
                                an exemption law and an appraisement and a stay law. While we may
                                not change an appraismnent or stay law we may modify an exemption
                                law. Will a Senator say it is not a reasonable proposition that a
                                volunteer who goes into the service of the United States or of this
                                State makes a sacrifice of the plesures of home the quiet and
                                endearments of his own fireside - that what little he has left shall
                                be exempt during the time he is in actual service? Senators will
                                bear in mind there are no constitutional provisions that declare the
                                Legislature may not at its discretion modify the exemption law. I
                                believe it is not contended that the exemption law enters into a
                                contract.
                            Mr. WOLFE (interrupting.) Is not the Senator mistaken?
                            Mr. RAY. I think not, though I do not know that it is admitted by all
                                Senators. Although there is in principle no great distinction
                                between appraisement, stay or execution law, yet while the
                                appraisement and stay laws may be settled in the negative, I think
                                the other law has been decided the other way. The true reason of the
                                distinction between a stay law, an appraisement law and an exemption
                                law is probably this, the stay law is a permanent rule of law - so
                                is an appraisement law, and parties to a contract are supposed to
                                have such laws in view: but an exemption law has not the power to
                                fix the amount of means that a debtor shall have when the debt falls
                                due and when execution is issued. The amount of property which a
                                debtor has is subject to fluctuation and change, depending on the
                                fortunes of trade, mismanagement or other fortuious circumstances.
                                Hence a creditor can not look for his debtor to have any given
                                amount of property when his debts fall due.
                            Mr. WOLFE. I am in favor of any relief measure for the volunteers
                                that can be passed constitutionally. This matter was before the
                                    Judiciary Committee, and a majority of them
                                were of the opinion that this bill is not constitutional. I was of
                                that number. I do not think there was a member of the committee
                                opposed to the bill on the question of expediency. I think every
                                member of the committee would willingly have sustained the bill if
                                they could have done so in a valid manner. Upon this ground I shall
                                be compelled to vote against the amendment to the committee report.
                                I have heretofore said this proposition was a question of doubt, and
                                I believe I have said I would be willing to give it a trial, but
                                upon investigating the matter I am so thoroughly convinced upon that
                                point that I can not consistently vote for it. The Senator [Mr. Ray]
                                in his speech may have satisfied himself, but he has failed to
                                satisfy my mind that there is any difference ia principle between an
                                appraisement, stay or exemption law. Indeed if there is any
                                constitutional inhibitions that prevents the Legislature from
                                extending a stay or changing appraisement laws as to existing debts
                                or liabilities, there are many more and stronger reasons for
                                prohibiting the Legislature from extending an exemption to such
                                debts. As far as an extension of a stay law is concerned there
                                might, in the absence of decisions of the courts, be some doubts;
                                and it is equally a decided case that you can change or extend an
                                appraisement law. I think the only reason why there has been no
                                decision in regard to the point in regard to an exemption law is
                                that the question is so clear that it has been regarded as settled
                                by the decisions in regard to stay and appraisement laws, thus being
                                the same in principle. I think, if I were disposed to consume the
                                time of the Senate, plenty of arguments could be shown in support of
                                my position; but I am not disposed to do so, and have made this
                                brief statement only in explanation of the vote I shall give. If I
                                was satisfied the relief could be constitutionally given, I would
                                willingly vote for the bill.
                            Mr. SLACK. I presume that no one would go further to favor the
                                volunteer militia than I would; but, sir, it strikes me very
                                forcibly the position assumed by the Senator from Huutington is the
                                correct one. I think there can be no question at all about the
                                unconstitutiouality of that law; and believing that to be the fact I
                                can not, sir, consent to forego my convictions of duty and vote for
                                this bill. We, each and every one of us took an oath to support the
                                constitution, and now if we believe an act unconstitutional, I ask
                                if we can set aside what we believe to be a constitutional
                                prohibition, for the purpose of accommodating a class of citizens in
                                whose welfare we have a deep and abiding interest? Now the
                                constitution of our State says you shall not grant to one class of
                                citizens privileges and immunities which upon the same terms you do
                                not grant to other citizens of the State. As the Senator from
                                Harrison [Mr. Wolfe] has justly observed the proposition is so clear
                                and plain that no adjudication has been thought necessary to settle
                                the construction of that thing. It settles itself; it is a plain,
                                straight-forward proposition which needs no explanation. If you can
                                grant a soldier exemptions you can grant a farmer and a lawyer
                                certain privileges and immunities. The meaning of that
                                constitutional provision was that men should stand upon one broad
                                basis. The very fact of pursuing a particular occupation giving.
                            Mr. RAY (interrupting.) How is it about the legislative enactment
                                exempting lawyers from acting as witnesses?
                            Mr. SLACK. If one Legislature has passed a foolish law, no other
                                foolish act need be done by us as a necessary consequence. It is a
                                wrong policy in a Legislature to pass laws of  a doubtful constitutionality. I doubt
                                whether there is a man in the State who has the hardihood to issue
                                an execution upon the property of a volunteer, and if such were the
                                case public sentiment would put it down by the just indignation that
                                would surely come upon him. I do not believe the people of Indiana
                                demand such a law as this. I believe it would bankrupt the State and
                                that general ruin would follow.
                            Mr CLAYPOOL. I am opposed to any general system of relief laws, but I
                                am not prepared to say that I will not support a proper law that
                                intends to reach the object of this bill. I could support the
                                provisions of this bill as it is now incorperated, but I think a
                                bill might be framed that would avoid the obligation of contract.
                                And that is a serious objection with me. I could not be able to vote
                                properly and understandingly on that subject as at present advised.
                                Public sentiment, in my portion of the State, would not permit a
                                volunteer to be injured. I should much prefer that this whole
                                subject be referred to a select committee with instructions to
                                inquire whether a bill can be drafted to meet an emergency of this
                                kind, and that would avoid these constitutional objections. If such
                                a bill can be framed I am satisfied a majority of Senators would
                                vote for it.
                            Mr. MURRAY. We all went home with the idea of consulting our
                                constituencies in regard to relief laws. I found in my section a
                                unanimous sentiment in favor of some kind of measures of relief for
                                the volunteers. I was specially instructed, as far as I could get
                                the sentiment of my constituents, to vote for such measures, and I
                                stand in that position here, ready to vote for this bill or any
                                other of a similar character that may come before the Senate. I will
                                recollect the object of that constitutional clause quoted by
                                gentlemen here. I happened to be a spectator of the proceedings of
                                that convention at the time that clause was offered, and it was
                                aimed against banking institutions. I would like to put the question
                                how the Legislature could afford relief to any person at all if that
                                section was to be construed as it is by the Senators from Harrison
                                and Huntington. We have propositions every session to relieve some
                                one. It was proposed at the last session to relieve the treasurer of
                                Martin county whose safe was robbed, and such instances are
                                numerous.
                            Mr. DEHART. I do not rise for the purpose of making a speech on this
                                report, but simply to state the reasons which will govern my vote.
                                Having doubts as to the constitutionality of the bill, or any bill
                                which proposes to exempt the property of any particular class, I
                                took occasion, during the recess of this Legislature, to make the
                                inquiry of the most distinguished talent of the State, and they gave
                                me, as their deliberate and unanimous opinion, that such a law would
                                be clearly unconstitutional, as impairing the obligation of
                                contracts, and they referred me to the Constitution for proof. And
                                they further said, the obligation of a contract comprehended
                                everything that went to secture the performance of that contract.
                                And further, Mr. President, I do not think, in the failure of the
                                passage of this bill, that the volunteer soldier would be any worse
                                off, I believe he has a better security in the patriotic creditor of
                                the State of Indiana than in any law we might pass. That
                                incalculable power of public opinion is a better protection than any
                                law that could be passed by this Legislature. In our own State it
                                has made patriots of men who, a few short months ago, were in open
                                sympathy with traitors. In no part of the country do I think there
                                are persons who would take any advantage of the absence of a
                                volunteer soldier. There might be once in a while found a Shylock
                                who would demand the last drop, but I believe public opinion would
                                be against him to such an extent that it would more than compensate
                                him for it. Upon another ground, namely, the Constitutional
                                provision which says we shall riot grant privileges and immunities
                                to any particular class, which, upon the same terms, shall not be
                                granted to all, I must vote against this bill. In view of these
                                reasons and the power of public opinion, which will protect the
                                volunteer in the case, I think we had better vote for concurrence in
                                the report of the committee.
                            Mr. MILLER. I would call the attention of the Senate to sec. 22 of
                                the 1st act of the Constitution, upon which, I think, an objection
                                to this amendment may be raised, which has not yet been mentioned.
                                The amendment provides that all the property of each volunteer
                                debtor shall be exempt from sale. It, is quite clear, I think, that
                                sec. 22, under a fair construction, forbids the enactment of such a
                                law, to say nothing of the other points which have been raised here.
                                It implies that the Legislature may authorize the exemption of a certain amount of the property of the debtor from
                                forced sale. The language is, "a reasonable amount," and the same
                                section declares what was considered by the framers a reasonable
                                amount, in the following language: "The privilege of the debtor to
                                enjoy the necessary comforts of life shall be recognized by
                                wholesome laws, exempting a reasonable amount," &c. An amount
                                necessary for the enjoyment of the "necessary comforts of life." is,
                                then, a reasonable amount. Now this means that any man may have a
                                certain amount of property exempt from saleone man precisely the
                                same as another for the necessary comforts of life are the same to
                                each man under one theory of government. If this amendment should
                                become the law, there would be no uniformity as to the amount of
                                exemption, for one man may hold exempt $100, another $1,000, another
                                $5,000, and another $100,000. No one would contend, I presume, that
                                this latter sum would be a reasonable amount for the enjoyment of
                                the "necessary comforts of life." This would give, also, one citizen
                                privileges not enjoyed by others, and the law could not be of  uniform operation among the
                                citizens of the state, manifestly unjust as well as palpably
                                unconstitutional. I would be glad to vote for a law to suspend the
                                collection of debts as to the volunteer soldiery of Indiana. Nothing
                                would give me more pleasure, but to pass this bill amended as
                                proposed would avail them nothing, and would be worse than useless
                                for the reasons I have briefly given, as well as tipon several other
                                considerations. I would be glad to exempt $1,000 of the volunteer
                                debtor's property, if it can be lawfully done, thus treating all men
                                alike. Whatever the exemption may be, I am quite clear that it
                                should be an amount certain. If a man have enough to pay his debts
                                without depriving his family of the comforts of life, he is
                                honorably bound to pay his debts. That obligation is of as high a
                                nature as the one which impels him to fight for his country.
                            Mr. MARCH. Relying upon my own judgment, I should have no hesitation
                                about this bill being unconstitutional, because it is against the
                                provision of our Constitution which prohibits the granting, to any
                                class of citizens, privileges which shall not equally belong to all.
                                But the decisions of the courts have somewhat involved the question.
                                If no other gentleman does, I will introduce a bill to increase the
                                amount of property which shall be exempt from execution in all
                                eases. The object of these laws is to furnish a defense against the
                                oppression to which avarice, passion or want may subject the debtor.
                                The amount now exempt is only $300. That is not enough; it is a mere
                                pittance, and accomplishes but very little. And if the Senator (Mr.
                                Ray) can convince me that we can make the increased exemption apply
                                to contracts made heretofore, I will vote for it. I am in favor of
                                doing everything reasonable that can be done, to encourage and
                                reward our volunteer soldiers, for they come from the class who
                                constitute the bone and sinew of the land, and are not, as a general
                                thing, blessed with an abundance of property. They go and peril
                                their lives in defense of the Constitution of our country, and I
                                will vote for any constitutional proposition that will exempt them
                                from personal taxation. Under the law as it now stands, the
                                volunteer is obliged to pay a poll and capitation road tax. This is
                                wrong. For these reasons, briefly stated, I would concur in the
                                report of the committee, with the intention of hereafter voting for
                                any proposition that will increase the exemption as to all persons,
                                and as to soldiers in particular.

                            The PRESIDENT announced the special order, viz.: Senator Wolfe's
                                bill, S. No. 21, introduced day before yesterday.
                            On motion by Mr. MARCH, it was postponed and made the special order
                                for to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            PROPOSED VISIT FROM THE KENTUCKY LEGISLATURE.
                            Mr. SLACK, from the Committee on Federal
                                Relations, returned his joint resolution, S No. 5,
                                introduced May 3, and printed on page 63 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE
                                REPORTS, recommending passage.
                            Mr. SLACK. This is the joint resolution which was submitted to the
                                Senate two or three weeks since, inviting the Kentucky Legislature
                                to visit the State of Indiana and become guests of the State. The
                                    Committee on Federal Relations recommend its
                                passage, but I do not know that it, will do any good now, for the
                                probability is that the Kentucky Legislature adjourns to-day.
                                However, there can be no harm in the passage of this resolution, and
                                I think it is nothing more than right that we should. It is a
                                friendly expression on the part of the people of the State of
                                Indiana, and will be appreciated by the people of Kentucky
                            Mr. LINE proposed to amend by adding the words "union loving" after
                                the word "patriotic."
                            Mr. CONNER. The Senator from Putnam, (Mr. Johnston,) offered an
                                amendment, which was accepted, as I understand it, embracing also
                                the Governor of Kentucky.
                            Mr. SLACK. It was subsequently withdrawn.
                            Mr. CONNER. I desire the Journal, to show that it was withdrawn.
                            Mr. SLACK. The amendment of the Senator from Franklin, (Mr. Line,) is
                                out of place and not good rhetoric. When we talk about patriotic
                                citizens, we mean union loving men, and unless they are union loving
                                they are not patriotic. Then why the necessity of inserting that in
                                these resolutions which is already there. I hope the gentleman will
                                not insist upon his amendment.
                            Mr. LINE. I have nothing particular to say in defense of my
                                amendment. It seems to me there can be no objection to it. The
                                explanation of the gentleman from Huntington [Mr. Slack] has
                                removed, to some extent, my objections to the phraseology, but I
                                would like to take the sense of the Senate on it.
                            Mr. HAMILTON. I will take the liberty of saying in my place here,
                                that no Senator upon this floor, nor no citizen of Indiana or the
                                United States, is more decidedly in favor of maintaining this Union
                                than I am, but I can see no good in calling the Legislature of
                                Kentucky here. These meetings of Legislatures  are friendly frolics. And who is to
                                pay these expenses? The State of Indiana. We are making large
                                expenditures, and the Commissary's department, is making large
                                expenditures. Believing, as I do, that it will result in no good,
                                but in an expense to the people and in a great frolic, I am opposed
                                to the resolution.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I see, by the papers this morning, that the Kentucky
                                Legislature yesterday undone its work of the day before. I will read
                                the paragraph - it is short.
                            "THE KENTUCKY LEGISLATURE. -This inscrutable body yesterday kicked
                                over its work of the day before, and passed the bill to appropriate
                                one million and sixty thousand dollars to be borrowed - to arm the
                                State. This is, of course, a triumph of the secessionists, and
                                removes the chief obstacle to "precipitation." If this bill was a
                                compromise on the part of the Union party, they have compromised
                                away all their safety."
                            A VOICE. "From what, paper do you read ?"
                            Mr. MURRAY. The Cincinnati Gazette.
                            A VOICE. "That accounts for it."
                            Mr. MURRAY. We have furnished our thousands of volunteers. The
                                Kentucky Legislature is arming the secessionists of that State to
                                fight them, and we will take the money derived from taxes levied
                                upon these volunteers that we have refused relief to, and vote it
                                out of the State Treasury to bring these Kentucky secessionists over
                                here. There has not been one single, solitary Union sentiment
                                uttered by the Kentucky Legislature since it has been in session. It
                                is true there are good, loyal, Union loving men in that Legislature,
                                but their voice has been crushed out. And we stand here inviting
                                traitors to our hospitality, when perhaps it will not be long before
                                our sons will be welcomed there with bloody hands to hospitable
                                graves. I undertake to say that the traitors who have control of
                                that State will take it out of the Union in spite of the Union
                                loving people within her borders. What face can we present to the
                                people in dallying with these men? They have not taken the first
                                step towards supporting the Government, but on the contrary they
                                have appropriated money to arm themselves in defiance of it, and,
                                through ito authorize the Auditor of State to secure pay-their
                                Executive, forbid the Government to put foot upon Kentucky soil. I
                                trust, Mr. President, the resolutions will be voted down.
                            Mr. CAMPBELL. From a natural hatred I have to such resolutions, and
                                not from any disrespect to the author, I move to lay them on the
                                table.

                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            FRIDAY, May 24, 1861.
                        
                        The House met at nine o'clock A. M.
                        Mr. COLLINS of Adams, asked that his refusal to vote on Mr. Jones of
                            Tippecanoe's joint resolution of instructions to the Indiana delegation
                            in Congress, was because the House refused to hear his explanation might
                            be entered on the journal.
                        The SPEAKER. The gentleman can obtain his object by protest.
                        
                            DISTRIBUTION OF THE SCHOOL FUND.
                            The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the
                                Superintendent of Public Instruction, with reference to the
                                distribution of the school fund, which was communicated to the
                                Senate yesterday, and is published in these proceedings of that
                                day.
                            It was referred to the Committee on Education.
                        
                        
                            STATE TROOPS.
                            Mr. JENKINSON submitted a joint resolution directing the Governor to
                                turn over to the service of the United States four of the regiments
                                in the service of the State of Indiana, and retire the remainder on
                                half pay.
                            He said there was no need of remaining any longer in camp with our
                                troops. He would go as far as any man to defend the country, but the
                                militia could drill at home. Moreover, there is required,
                                immediately, a hundred millions of money to carry on this war; and
                                we should take care of our credit if we want to borrow money.
                            The SPEAKER. The resolution is out of order, for the reason that you
                                can not control the operations of a bill by a resolution.
                            Mr. JENKINSON appealed from this decision, which appeal he
                                subsequently presented in writing, as follows:
                            "A resolution having been introduced, requesting the Governor to turn
                                over four of the State 
                                regiments to the service of the United States, and immediately
                                retire the remainder on half pay, and the Speaker having ruled it
                                out of order, I appeal from that decision for the following
                                reasons:
                            "The bill organizing six regiments of State troops -"
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair can not consent that the gentleman should
                                encumber the journal with reasons. The gentleman can state his
                                reasons orally.
                            After some conversation across the House -
                            On motion by Mr. ORESHAM, the matter of the appeal was laid on the
                                table.
                        
                        
                            LANDLORD'S LIEN.
                            On motion by Mr. EDSON, the bill registered (S. 30) enabling persons
                                of small means to rent land without giving personal security
                                therefor (the same that was passed the Senate the last session, but
                                lacked time in the House) was taken np and passed to the second
                                reading.
                            Mr. EDSON moved a suspension of tho rules to enable him to make a
                                further motion to con sider the bill on the second reading.
                            Mr. GRESHAM said it was a wicked billan attempt to revive the old
                                principle of a landlord's lieu. He moved to lay Mr. Edson's motion
                                for a suspension of the rules on the table; which motion was decided
                                in the negative, by yeas 35, nays 48.
                            But still the House refused to suspend the rules - yeas 46, nays 37 -
                                two-thirds not voting in the affirmative.
                        
                        
                            LEGALIZATION OF TOWNS.
                            Mr. BUNDY, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                returned Mr. Jones of Wayne's bill, No. 43, to legalize the incorporation of towns, &c.,
                                under the act of June 11, 1852, and all by-laws, rules regulations
                                and proceeding adopted in pursuance thereof, without amendment, and
                                with a recommendation that the same do pass.
                            Mr. B. said the facts were correctly set forth in the preamble of the
                                bill; that certain town corporations had gone on to organize and do
                                business under the act of 1852 before it was published, supposing
                                that it was in force. The simple object of the bill was to legalize
                                these acts.
                            Mr. NEWMAN also explained further the necessity of this bill. A
                                portion of the late unauthorized acts of the towns in question were
                                appropriations for the equipment and relief of volunteers and their
                                families; so the bill was connected with the exigences of the
                                country.
                            The bill was passed to the third and last reading in the House of
                                Representatives by yeas 83, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            STATE AUDITOR'S BOND.
                            Mr. BUNDY, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                returned Mr. Hayes' Auditor's bill, [41] without amendment, and with
                                a recommendation that the same do pass.
                            And accordingly the bill was considered as engrossed, and passed the
                                third and last reading yeas 81, nays 0. [It increases the penalty of
                                the Auditor of States' bond to $100,000.]
                        
                        
                            HOME GUARDS.
                            On motion by Mr, GRESHAM, his Home Guards bill [37] was take up and
                                considered on the second reading.
                            Mr. GRESHAM proposed to amend by inserting a clause providing that
                                any company formed under this act shall provide in its own
                                constitution and by-laws for the time and manner of election of its
                                captain and under officers, said officers so elected shall be
                                commissioned by the Governor. He also proposed to correct an
                                omission by inserting the word "regiment." He stated, among the
                                advantages of this bill, that it admitted of the enrolment of
                                persons under 18 years as well as those over 45 years of age.
                            Mr. VEATCH proposed the following additional amendment to section 7:
                                "The officers and members of such companies shall take the same oath
                                as required by the general militia law of the State."
                            Mr. GRESHAM. I have no objection to the amendment, but we supposed
                                the bill covered that.
                            Mr. VEATCH. In discussing the provisions of this bill with our
                                people, I find some persons taking the construction that members of
                                the Home Guards would not be required to take the oath of the
                                militia law. If it is uncertain it ought to be made definite.
                            Mr. V.'s amendment was adopted.
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair would suggest a discrepancy between sections
                                three and five, in regard to the discretion of the Governor to arm
                                said companies. Section five seems to override the discretion.
                            Mr. GRESHAM. If the Governor thinks they are not loyal he may refuse
                                arms. It brings them all under the provisions of the militia
                                bill.
                            Mr. VEATCH called attention to the first section. One of the most
                                difficult things in all machinery was to start right. The first
                                question hew was, how will they begin? under the general militia
                                law? Do they file their lists with the county Auditor?
                            Mr. GRESHAM. They are brought under the provisions of the militia
                                bill.
                            Mr. VEATCH. The great difficulty under the militia law will be the
                                tardiness of organization. In that bill the Home Guards are not
                                required to report their elections to the Adjutant General; there is
                                no officer that can have or exercise any inspecting power over
                                them.
                            Mr. GRESHAM. They will organize and certify to the Governor in some
                                manner.
                            Mr. VEATCH. That is the very point I am raising. It must be done in
                                some manner. But one company will have one manner, another, another,
                                and so on.
                            Mr. GRESHAM. That is a discretion we wish to give them.
                            Mr. VEATCH. Would the gentleman understand that all their elections
                                shall be certified to the Aditor General?
                            Mr. GREHAM. Undoubtedly. That is the channel through which the
                                militia must address the Governor. I am willing to incorporate in my
                                amendment a clause prescribing that the company shall make return to
                                the Adjutant General. ["That'll do."]
                            Mr. Gresham's amendment, as thus modified, was adopted.
                            Mr. EDSON proposed to amend the first section, by inserting the words
                                "or townships," and the tenth section by inserting "and Township

                    BY ARIEL, & W. H. DRAPIER.

                        NO. 11.
                    
                    

                        
                            Trustees, in conjunction with the County Commissioners." In the
                                township where I reside we have raised a cavalry company, and we
                                want to pay the expense of equipping that company, by a vote of the
                                township, taxing ourselves for the purpose.
                            The amendments were adopted by consent.
                            The bill was then considered as engrossed, ordered to the third
                                reading, read the third time and passed - yeas 75, nays 8.
                            On motion by Mr. FISHER, the Committee on Ways and
                                    Means had leave to set during the session of the
                                House.
                            Mr. COLLINS, of Adams, submitted the following, which was ordered to
                                be entered on the journal:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        PROTEST.
                                        The undersigned, a member of the House of
                                            Representatives, respectfully enters his protest against
                                            the showing of the journal upon the passage of a joint
                                            resolution wherein the journal shows he was present and
                                            refused to vote. His reason for refusing to vote was
                                            that the House refused to hear the reason which would
                                            govern him in his vote, which reason is that he does not
                                            recognize the right of any body of public servants to
                                            give instructions to any other body of public servants,
                                            believing the entire power of giving instructions to any
                                            body of public servants remains with the people, and
                                            they alone have the right to exercise the power, and the
                                            undersigned will ever protest.

                                            P. N. COLLINS.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. BLACK introduced a bill [49] to amend section 7 of an act
                                entitled an act providing for the election of clerks of the Circuit
                                Courts and prescribing some of their duties, approved June 7, 1852,
                                and supplemental thereto, prescribing the management and disposition
                                of certain funds therein named, and the duties of the county
                                auditors and treasurers in connection therewith, and fixing
                                penalties for the violation of this act, and repealing all laws
                                conflicting with this act.
                            It was passed to the second reading.
                        
                        
                            ABATING LIQUOR.
                            Mr. THOMAS introduced bill (50) authorizing commanding officers in
                                the military service to abate liquor establishments [within two
                                miles of any encampment, drill or review ground.]
                            The bill was passed to the second reading.
                        
                        
                            THE SIX REGIMENT COMPANIES.
                            Mr. CASON, from the select committee appointed to examine the books
                                of the Adjutant General, and to report whether the companies
                                organized under the sixth regiment bill have been accepted in
                                pursuance of the provisions of said act, reported that, so far as
                                appears by the books of the Adjutant General, all the companies
                                except three or four, have been organized in accordance with the
                                provisions of the above entitled act, and that these companies are
                                now organized to their satisfaction, and mustered into service.
                            He stated that all the committee had to do, was to see whether the
                                companies were organized according to the books. There were some
                                complaints of matters which the books cannot settle. But the parties
                                complaining had all been mustered into the service to their
                                satisfaction.
                            The report was laid on the table.
                        
                        
                            TAX ASSESSMENT LAW.
                            Mr. BRETT, from the select committee thereon, returned, his bill
                                    [48] introduced
                                yesterday, amendatory of sections 75, 78, 79, 94, 95, 104, 142, and
                                143 of the valuation and appraisement act, with amendments allowing
                                five per cent, for the maximum of the county treasurer's fee for the
                                collection of delinquent taxes, and "twenty-five cents a line of
                                tabular description of property, valuation and taxes," for
                                advertising the delinquent list, &c., and giving the
                                advertisement to the lowest bidder: where there is competition.
                            Mr. BRETT. Section one of this bill amends section 75 of the existing
                                act, so as to strike out some unneeessary columns containing the
                                valuation of property in the duplicate. As the law now stands the
                                auditor is required to place one column for the value of lands; a
                                second column for the value of improvements, and a third column for
                                the value of the land and the improvements. This bill requires the
                                auditor to put the value of the land and the improvements in one
                                column. Fifteen years experience in a county auditor's office has
                                taught me that there is no need of these being separately shown.
                                They are separately shown in the appraiser's list, which can be
                                found, also, in the auditor's office. The bill thereby strikes off
                                the expense of the work of the auditor to that extent. Again, as the
                                law now stands, the auditor is required to put the value of town
                                lots in one column, the improvements in another column, and the
                                total in a third column. This bill strikes off the two first of
                                these columns; so, hereby we propose to strike off four columns of
                                figures on the duplicate. Then section 78 is amended so as to
                                require the auditor to place in one column all the taxes for the
                                current year the aggregate of taxes - thereby striking out from the
                                duplicate all those intermediate columns between the total valuation
                                of property and the total of taxes. These columns are entirely
                                unnecessary, only increasing the size of the duplicate and the cost
                                of making it out. At the  end
                                of the duplicate the auditor is required to make a recapitulation
                                and apportionment. He is also required to add the tax on polls. At
                                the end he must make a recapitulation, and apportion the tax for
                                State, county, township and school purposes. That is done by a
                                simple calculation; for example, suppose the tax for a township is
                                $10,000, and $500 is the tax on polls. The $500 is subtracted from
                                the $10,000, and the remaining $9,500 is apportioned as the tax on
                                property. This is very easily done and it abridges the size of the
                                tax duplicate very much, and cuts down the expense in proportion. I
                                would not cut down one cent from the compensation of the county
                                auditor for services rendered by him; for I am satisfied that
                                    that officer performs more labor for less pay than
                                other county officers. I have seen that this could have been done
                                years ago, and have oftened wondered why it was not done. Section
                                94, as the law now stands, requires the county treasurer to post
                                notices of his visits for the collection of taxes, at the various
                                places of holding elections. This has been found to be entirely
                                useless. The expense of getting up these advertisements, and other
                                expenses attendant on this requirment are so much, and these taken
                                together with the fact that the amount of money actually collected
                                by these calls of the treasurers would not pay their traveling
                                expenses, plainly suggests the propriety of this amendment to the
                                bill, which is not to require him to visit the townships, but to
                                remain in his office for collections till the fourth Monday in
                                March. Section 95 is amended so that the notice of the rate of
                                taxation is to be published in a newspaper of the county and posted
                                at the Court House door. Under the former act he was required to
                                post these notices in each township. By section 104 of this act as
                                it now stands the treasurer is allowed 6 per cent, on delinquencies
                                collected by him. And his delinquent return is made up at the time
                                when he receives a new duplicate. As the law now stands it holds out
                                to the treasurer inducements to make a big delinquent list. We have
                                thought it proper to amend that section so as only to allow him 5
                                per cent, of the maximum of his fees on delinquents, which is above
                                the average fee for collecting taxes. Unless the county treasurers
                                make more exertions to collect the taxes on their duplicates, the
                                public interests will suffer deeply. The most of them take the cream
                                of the job and let the others go. I am satisfied that there is not
                                one treasurer in fifty that makes his calls on the tax payer for
                                collections as the law contemplates. For this reason I have thought
                                proper to cut down the fee to 5 per cent.
                            Mr. FRAZIER. Would the cutting down of the fee make the treasurers
                                increase their exertions?
                            Mr. BRETT. I suppose not, Section 142 is amended so as to put off the
                                collection of delinquent taxes till the first day of December, which
                                puts off also the time of recording advertising and sale one month
                                later. This will enable the delinquents having produce to sell, to
                                do so in time to meet the treasurer and save the expense of
                                advertising, and so prevent his land from being sold for taxes. I am
                                satisfied that by this bill the length of the advertised list will
                                be cut down one-third; and that the number of sales will be cat down
                                one-half.
                            Mr. ROBBINS. What will be the probable saving to the State by this
                                bill?
                            Mr. BRETT. Gentlemen have made various estimates of that, varying
                                $15,000 to $100,000. I think the bill cannot fall short of an annual
                                saving of at least $50,000. Section 143 is amended so as better to
                                regulate the cost of advertising under the present law. The cost of
                                advertising varies very much. We have found that about 25 cents
                                aline will be a fair compensation. It is good pay, but not two high
                                for the service, and will be, I think, a saving of about 30 per
                                cent, of the price now paid for publishing delinquent lists on the
                                average.
                            Mr. BUNDY. I have great confidence in the judgment of the gentleman
                                from Daviess in matters of this kind. But I think he will concur
                                with me in the opinion, in his reforms proposed in this bill, he has
                                not gone quite far enough. The reduction of the County Treasurer's
                                fees, on delinquent taxes, from 8 to 5 per cent, was eminently
                                proper and fit; but that is a small item. It is well known to
                                members here that the office of County Treasurer is the most
                                valuable, the most lucrative office in the State. And I submit to
                                gentlemen, that if we are going to reform these things, we ought to
                                begin at the right place; and the gentleman from Daviess has
                                commenced, not at the head, but at the tail of the abuse. He ought
                                to have commenced with a reduction of fees on the aggregate of taxes
                                on he duplicate, instead of commencing on the delinquent list. What
                                are the Treasurer's fees or collecting the revenue? He gets eight
                                per cent, on the first thousand dollars - descending gradually to
                                three per cent, on all sums over $15,000. And in some counties he
                                collects as high as $200,000. Sir, I have examined into this thing.
                                I claim to know something about it; and with the aid of the
                                gentleman from Spencer, (Mr. Veatch,) last winter, we introduced a
                                toll regulating the fees of the Treasurer, and it passed the House
                                but not the Senate. This subject is worthy of consideration,
                                especially at this time, now, when we are increasing the taxes -
                                when our levies for county and State purposes have to be doubled, or
                                perhaps more than doubled. And in proportion as you increase the
                                revenue, you add to the value of the Treasurer's office. This is now
                                the best office in the State. The Treasurer sometimes gets a heavier
                                pay than the Governor. Take the county of Wayne, the Treasurer's
                                office there is worth $5,000 a year.  And if it is worth $5,000 now, what
                                will it be worth when we shall have doubled the taxes? I submit
                                then, that this bill ought to be re committed, with instructions to
                                add a section, to the effect, that when the aggregate of taxes n the
                                duplicate shall exceed $30,000 or $50,000 (I am not particular,) the
                                Treasurer, instead of receiving three per cent. on all sums above
                                that amount, shall receive but one per cent.; and his office then
                                will still be one of the most valuable in the county. But my
                                confiding friend here prefers a separate bill; and I will therefore
                                withhold the motion, and give notice of a separate bill, which I
                                will introduce for this purpose.
                            Mr. CASON proposed to recommit the bill with instructions to reduce
                                the County Audit's fees 25 per cent, as nearly as possible. This
                                bill, he said, had been introduced by a committee with a majority of
                                old County Auditors upon it, and they were pitching into the County
                                Treasurers, with whom, some of them, perhaps, have not been on good
                                terms always. He objected to the statement that the Treasurer's was
                                the best office in the State. One of the rumors why the Treasurers
                                had made money, was that they had drawn two and a half per cent, on
                                redeemed county orders, gut whenever that had been done, it has not
                                been according to law. Where the Treasurer's fees have been lawfully
                                restricted, he apprehended that their compensation has not been so
                                much higher in proportion to their services as gentlemen seem to
                                think. Strip the county Treasurer of his illegal fees, and his
                                compensation would not be much higher than it ought to be. But he
                                affirmed that the county Auditor has the best office in the State of
                                Indiana. Your county Treasurers to-day draw an average of
                                compensation of $1,200, whilst your county Auditors draw nearly
                                $3,000. [It is without authority of law.] Your Treasurers are
                                drawing without authority of law; and now if you are going to
                                economize, let us have economy in all the offices. He went on at
                                length to detail exhorbitant fees demanded by the county
                                Auditors.
                            Mr. BRETT. The bill reduces the cost of making out the tax duplicate
                                at least one-third. I propose to reduce the Auditor's compensation
                                by reducing his labor. If the gentleman will wait, and examine the
                                Auditor's pay, one year after this bill shall take effect, he will
                                find it cut down at least 30 per cent., whilst the bill does not
                                interfere at all with the Treasurers fees, except on the delinquent
                                list.
                            Mr. CASON. How very generous these old county Auditors are! They are
                                willing to have their fees taken off for the work they never do. I
                                want, not only to reduce the work they do, but to reduce their fees
                                also on the work actually done by them, so that you will not pay
                                your county officers fees that are exorbitant in all respects.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. The bill is a more in the right direction, and I am
                                unwilling to let it be lost because it does not go far enough to
                                suit the views of some, therefore I demand the previous
                                question.
                            There was a second to this demand, and under its operation the bill
                                was passed the third and last reading - yeas 81, nays 2 - with an
                                amendment of the title.
                        
                        
                            ABOLITION OF THE COMMON PLEAS.
                            Mr. SPEAKER ALLEN asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill (51)
                                to provide for the organization of Circuit Courts, the election of
                                Judges thereof, defining their powers and duties and the
                                jurisdiction of said courts, and fixing the salaries of said Judges
                                and the number of terms of said courts, and providing for adjourned
                                terms of said courts; and transferring the Probate business of the
                                Common Pleas Court to the Circuit Court; and repealing all former
                                laws on the subject.
                            On motion by Mr. ALLEN, (the rules being suspended for the purpose,)
                                the bill was twice read and referred to the Committee on
                                    the Judiciary.
                            The House then took a recess till two o'clock P.M.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The Senate joint resolution instructing the Auditor of State to audit
                                the per diem, of the officers of the General
                                Assembly for the same number of days certified for the service of
                                members in the present session, (announced this morning in a message
                                by Secretary Brown,) coming up in order -
                            Mr. WOODHULL made an ineffectual motion to refer the resolution to
                                the Committee on Ways and Means, and also an
                                ineffectual demand for the yeas and nays.
                            The joint resolution was then concurred in without a division.

                            
                                CLERK TO THE ADJUTANT GENARAL.
                                Mr. VEATCH introduced a bill, [52] supplemental to the act of
                                    March 11, 1861, for the organization and regulation of the
                                    Indiana Militia, &c. [It authorizes the Adjutant General to
                                    employ a clerk at an annual salary not exceeding $800.]
                                It was passed to the second reading.
                                Mr. LANE introduced a bill, [53] to amend section 34 of the act
                                    providing for the incorporation of railroad companies, approved
                                    May H, 1852. [It extends the time for the completion of
                                    railroads to ten years from the 10th of December, 1862, where
                                    the company have expended $400,000 on their road-bed.]
                                The bill was passed to the second reading.
                            
                            
                                COUNTY TREASURERS' FEES.
                                Mr. BUNDY introduced a bill to amend the 9th section of the act
                                    of March 2, 1855, regulating the fees of officers, and repealing
                                    former acts in relation thereto. [It fixes the county
                                    treasurers' fees on tax collections at 8 per cent, on the first
                                    $1000; 7 per cent, between $1000 and $2000; 6 per cent, between
                                    $2000 and $3000; 5 per cent, between $3000 and $4000; 4 per
                                    cent, between $4000 and $5000; 3 per cent, between $5000 and
                                    $15,000; 2 per cent, between $15,000 and $25,000; and one per
                                    cent, on all sums above $25,  000; allows him 5 cents on each county order redeemed, 8
                                    cents per mile mileage, and 10 cents for each tract of land sold
                                    for taxes.] The bill was passed the second reading.
                                The House then adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            SATURDAY, May 25, 1861.
                        
                        Mr. BLAIR, from the Committee on Finance, returned
                            Senator Craven's bill [S. No. 47] entitled "a bill making additional
                            provisions for the payment of the loan of two millions of dollars,
                            authorized by the apt of the General Assembly," approved May 13, 1861,
                            with the following amendment, and when so amended recommend its passage:
                            "Insert after the word 'levied' in the second line of the 1st section,
                            the words 'for State debt sinking fund purposes."
                        The report was concurred in.
                        
                            SUBSTITUTION OF JUDGES IN CERTAIN CASES.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON offered a resolution"That the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary be instructed to inquire into and ascertain
                                whether there is any effectual law now in force providing for the
                                trial of causes in cases where there may be affidavits of prejudice
                                of the Judge filed, where he may be related to either party, and
                                report by bill or otherwise.
                            Mr. MARCH. There is no objection, I presume, to the resolution,
                                though as one of the members of the committee, I prefer any Senator
                                who has anything of that kind would introduce a bill. Such a course
                                would facilitate the matter. The difficulty is simply this, there is
                                no extra pay to the Judge, and they decline serving, that is the
                                reason we don't have such courts; and there is no power to compel
                                them to serve. I apprehend the General Assembly will pass no bill
                                increasing the pay.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON. I do not know what the reasons are, and for that reason
                                I offer the resolution, so that we can know.
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                            DECEDENT ESTATES.
                            Mr. Miller's bill S. No. 35, introduced on Wednesday afternoon,
                                coming up in regular order, was read the second time and ordered to
                                be engrossed for the third reading.
                        
                        
                            JOSEPH MOORE.
                            Mr. March's bill S. No.32, was
                                read the second time.
                            Mr. MARCH. That bill was referred to the Judiciary
                                    Committee last session and its passage recommended. It
                                is unnecessary to refer it again.
                            The PRESIDENT. There being no objection, the bill will be ordered
                                engrossed for a third reading.
                        
                        
                            DOCKET FEES.
                            Mr. March's bill S. No. 31,
                                also introduced on Wednesday afternoon, was read the second
                                time.
                            Mr. MARCH. That bill passed this body at the last session. There is
                                now no law allowing pay to District Attorneys, and unless some
                                Senator has some objections, I trust it will not be delayed, but
                                allowed to pass to a third reading on to-morrow. It provides that no
                                fees are to be paid out of the county treasury, under any
                                circumstances, except on a conviction for felony by the money can
                                riot be made out of the defendant Then the county pays a five dollar
                                docket fee.
                            The bill was ordered to be engrossed for the third reading.
                        
                        
                            SCHOLARSHIPS IN THE STATE UNIVERSITY.
                            Mr. Tarkington's bill S. No. 34, was read the second time.
                            Mr. WHITE. Is that Mr. Tarkington's bill.
                            SEVERAL VOICES. Yes.
                            Mr. WHITE. He requested me to ask that the bill be considered as
                                engrossed and read the third time.
                            SEVERAL VOICES. There is no quorum present.
                            Mr. WHITE. If there is a quorum present-V
                            VOICES. There is no quorum. No quorum.
                            Mr. WHITE. Well, I suppose there is not a quorum present. Let it lie
                                on the table till he returns.
                            The PRESIDENT. The bill can be taken up at any time. It will be
                                passed to a third reading.

                            Mr. Newcomb's bill, S. No. 33, was read the second time.
                            Mr. MARCH. By the request of the Senator from Marion, who introduced
                                this bill, I move to refer it to the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary.
                            The PRESIDENT. It is so ordered.
                        
                        
                            QUARTERMASTERS AND COMMISSARIES.
                            Mr. Mellett's bill S. No. 38,
                                introduced day before yesterday, was read the second time and
                                ordered to be engrossed for the third reading.
                        
                        
                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
                            Mr. TURNER. I propose to ask leave of absence for the Senator from
                                Miami, [Mr. Bearss.] He is not in a good state of health this
                                morning and desires leave of absence till Monday.
                            The PRESIDENT. The Secretary will make a minute of it.
                            Mr. MILLER. The gentleman from Cass, [Mr. De Hart] desires me to ask
                                leave of absence till Monday morning.
                            Mr. MARCH. Will the Senator state where he has gone?
                            Mr. MILLER. He said he was going to Cincinnati. He said he had some
                                friends at Camp Dennison who were in the army. They were desiring to
                                see him and he was desirous of seeing them. That is what he said. I
                                move he have leave of absence.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                            Mr. COBB. I desire to ask leave of absence for the Senator from
                                Huntington, [Mr. Slack.] He has also gone to Cincinnati to visit his
                                friends. [Laughter.]

                            Mr. Beeson's bill S. No. 49
                                was read the second time.
                            Mr. LINE. I do not know exactly what are the merits of that bill. It
                                seems to me it should go to the Committee on
                                    Education.
                            Mr. BEESON. The object of the bill is simply to amend the two
                                sections of the school law pained in the bill - sections 54 and 56.
                                [Mr. B recited the particulars of a case in his own county which
                                makes it necessary to amend the law a proposed in his bill in order
                                that the school section belonging to that particular congressional
                                township, may be sold.]
                            Mr. MURRAY. The bill ought to be amended so as to embrace all
                                congressional townships that are divided by county lines. There are
                                several cases of that kind in the State.
                            Mr. LINE. I still think it would not be wrong to refer that bill to
                                the Education Committee. They might amend it so
                                as to meet the case spoken of by the Senator from Elkhart, [Mr
                                Murray.]
                            The PRESIDENT. Will the Senator consent? It is so ordered.
                        
                        
                            THE TAX DUPLICATE.
                            Mr. Shoemaker's bill, S. No. 50, was read the second time, and
                                referred to the Committee on County and Township
                                    Business.

                            SATURDAY, May 25, 1861.
                        
                        The House met at 9 o'clock, A. M.
                        On motion of Mr. GIFFORD, the reading of the journal of yesterday was
                            dispensed with.
                        
                        
                            CARE OF SICK SOLDIERS.
                            Mr. FISHER submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Military Affairs be instructed to
                                            inquire into the expediency and necessity of making some
                                            further provision for sick soldiers, as well those who
                                            are mustered into the service of the United States from
                                            this State, as for those who are retained in the service
                                            of this State.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. FISHER. I visited this morning the City Hospital, which has been
                                given up to the use of the sick soldiers. I found there fifty-five
                                soldiers, all sick of the measles. There is no provision for
                                attendance and nursing, except the rations, and the rations, which
                                they generally commute for money, arc entirely insufficient for the
                                sick. Many of the sick are from Camp Morton, and a large proportion
                                of them State troops. The gentleman in charge told me that there
                                were thirteen sent in from Camp Morton. It is necessary to remove
                                them at once from camp, to prevent contagion. These sick troops
                                consist of men who whenever they have been sick have had careful
                                nursing. They are fresh in camp, unused to its hardships, and the
                                provisions are wholly insufficient for comfort and the preservation
                                of their lives. They are accustomed to have female nursing; and I
                                think the Legislature ought to provide them - ten cents a day for
                                each sick soldier would perhaps be araple for this purpose. I have
                                therefore introduced this resolution for the purpose of having the
                                matter inquired into by the Committee on Military
                                    Affairs, and of obtaining a report upon it, and a
                                recommendation of some means by which these sick men shall be
                                humanely cared for.
                            The resolution was adopted.
                            On motion of Mr. WOODS, Mr. Turner had leave of absence till
                                Monday.
                        
                        
                            COUNTY BOARDS.
                            Mr. BUNDY introduced a bill [55] authorizing county boards to
                                purchase and hold for the benefit of their counties a portion of the
                                bonds issued by the State of Indiana; [bonds of the six percent, war
                                loan;] which (under dispensation) was twice read and considered on
                                the second reading.
                            Mr. BUNDY moved that it be considered as engrossed and read the third
                                time now.
                            Mr. DOBBINS. It seems to me that there should be a provision
                                requiring the County Commissioners to be governed in these purchases
                                by the provisions of the loan law.
                            Mr. BUNDY. They hold the bonds just as any other purchaser.
                            Mr. PARRETT was unable to see what possible good that bill will do.
                                The chief difficulty with him was that he didn't believe the
                                counties have any money to purchase the bonds.
                            Mr. EDSON and Mr. BUNDY. Applications have been made by County
                                Commissioners. The county of Posey has $10,000 to invest.
                            Mr. PARRETT. If the bill authorizes the County Commissioners to levy
                                a tax for the purpose, I am opposed to it.
                            Mr. BUNDY. I offered the bill more particularly to satisfy some
                                distinguished citizens of Posey county, who are desirous that the
                                county should invest in these bonds.
                            Mr. ORR. Does the bill authorize the levy of a tax.
                            Mr. BUNDY. It does not.
                            Mr. DOBBINS. Does it authorize the Comissioners to use the surplus
                                funds in any way.
                            Mr. BUNDY. That is in their discretion.
                            Mr. CRAIN. I do not like the term "war loan." I would prefer to say
                                "two million loan.'' It is not in any sense a war loan. It is really
                                loan to suppress invasion and rebellion.
                            Mr. BUNDY. I am not particular about words. But I think the word war
                                is as expressive as any we can use. It is authorized, having been
                                used by the Loan Commissioners. They call it a war loan. It is
                                generally known as the war loan, and it is a war loan to all intents
                                and purposes, I can see no good to result from the amendment.
                            Mr. ROBERTS. Insert the title of the Loan act.
                            Mr. BUNDY. I would suggest the words "the two million war loan." Mr.
                                DAVIS objected. Mr. CRAIN. We were careful in the wordier of this
                                bill to use the words of the Constitution. I do not understand that
                                this Government can declare war on our own people. They can only
                                authorize the suppression of rebellion. They can't declare war in a
                                case where there is no government recognized to declare war
                                upon.
                            Mr. DOBBINS. What's the difference be tween fighting 50,000 rebels
                                and 50,000 foreigners?
                            Mr. CRAIN. I shall not be tenacious. But such an expression looks so
                                though we recognized the Southern Confederacy.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. How can we blockade our own ports?
                            Mr. McLEAN considered the distinction here as the difference betwixt
                                tweedle-dum and tweedle-deeas the Irish distinction between come out
                                McCarthy, and McCarthy come out.
                            Mr. NEBEKER demanded the previous question, under its operation the
                                bill was put on its final passage resulting - yeas 70, nays 12 - as

                            THE NORTHERN STATE PRISON.
                            Mr. McLEAN, from the Committee on Ways and Means,
                                reported a bill [56] fixing the salary and compensation of the Board
                                of Control, and other officers of the Northern State Prison, and
                                repealing all laws inconsistent therewith. [It makes the annual
                                salary of each member of the Board $800; of the warden not exceeding
                                $1,500, as to the Board of Control may seem reasonable;" of the
                                deputy warden $800; of the Physician $500; of the clerk of the
                                prison $800, to be paid quarterly ; the Board of Control to employ,
                                in lieu of the moral instructor, some minister of the gospel, in good
                                standing, to preach once a week, for which said minister shall
                                receive an annual compensation not exceeding $400. The compensation
                                of the day guard to be $40 per month, and of the night guard $45 per
                                month.]
                            The bill was passed the first reading.
                            Mr. SMITH of Bartholomew, moved a suspension of the rules and
                                constitutional provision to admit of a motion to consider the bill
                                on the second reading now.
                            Mr. McLEAN. Under the present law, the compensation of the Board of
                                Control is $3 per day each, which they construe to extend to every
                                day in the year. In addition to that, they draw compensation for
                                traveling expenses. The salaries in this bill are the same as those
                                paid to the officers of the Southern prison respectively.
                            Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker: I rise to make an inquiry, because I have
                                my doubts whether this bill changing the compensation of these
                                officers can effect those now in place there for the term for which
                                they have been elected. The feature with reference to the moral
                                instructor is well enough. The Board of Control now receive $3 per
                                day, and the Attorney General has decided that there is no warden.
                                They call him a Superintendent. With regard to the salary received
                                by the Commissioners - the Board - I consider it right that they
                                should be reduced to $800, because they only visit the prison once
                                in three months, alternately, one of them making a visit
                                occasionally once in two weeks,
                            Mr. McLEAN, (interposing.) Can the gentleman tell us what is the
                                condition of the moral instructor of that prison?
                            Mr. SHERMAN. That is a leading question, Mr. Speaker. I think I could
                                answer it perhaps, but duty to myself demands that I should decline
                                giving my opinion. If the gentleman desires to know his
                                qualifications fortending a studhorse, I can answer that I am
                                persuaded he is well qualified for that position. [Laughter.]
                            Mr. NEBEKER. I understand that the Commissioners have taken about as
                                much for traveling expenses as their $3 a day comes to.
                            Mr. LANE. With reference to the Moral Instructor, I can say that I
                                once told him that he was not the man for that position; and he
                                replied that he would do well enough to instruct convicts.
                            The rules were suspended and the bill was read the second time by
                                title.
                            Mr. NEBEKER. I move that the bill be considered as engrossed.
                            Mr. LANE. I move to amend by striking out the $1,500 in the case of
                                the Warden's compensation and insert $1,000 in lieu. I have learned
                                that the gentleman now holding that position was anxious to get it
                                at $1,000.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Then we ought to change the salary of the Warden of the
                                Southern Prison. I I think these officers should be kept
                                on an I equality.
                            Mr. McLEAN. The Warden is obliged to entertain the Sheriff when he
                                comes to bring prisoners, and all visitors, at his house; and it is
                                necessary that he should receive a compensation that will enable him
                                to do so. And I all the oversight and responsibility of the prison
                                is devolved upon him. I do not think the salary in the bill is too
                                high, but I think the salary of the Board of Control is too high.
                                Still, we are not prepared now to change that.
                            Mr. NEBEKER. I am for low salaries as much as any man. But I was
                                overruled in the regular session in every effort to reduce the
                                salaries. I appeal to the gentleman from Putnam [Mr. Lane] to state
                                whether the bill does not cut down the salaries materially. That
                                being the case, it is important that the bill should pass. It is
                                important, also, from the consideration that there may be some
                                trouble effecting the southern prison. The bill will effect a
                                positive saving of $5,000 a year.
                            Mr. CRAIN. This bill was introduced by the Committee on
                                    Ways and Means, and it proposes to mitigate expense.
                                Having examined the whole thing, we find that we are now paying
                                these officers much more than this bill will pay them. We are
                                greatly reducing their pay. Whilst I would be perfectly willing to
                                put the salaries of the Trustees lower, I am not willing to say that
                                the Warden's pay shall be any lower, because I know something about
                                what his duties are, and what is expected of him if he is a
                                gentleman. If we can reduce the salary of the Board, I would be glad
                                to do it; but I would not put the salaries in one prison lower than
                                in the other.
                            Mr. SHERMAN proposed to amend by authorizing the Board to hire a
                                master-builder, if the Warden is not competent, to superintend the
                                building of said prison. He said: "We resolved last session that
                                this prison Board had no authority to contract for any oversight of
                                the work: that they should do that themselves. But now there is no
                                officer there who is competent to superintend the construction of
                                that prison. I understand the Warden is not a mechanic. Unless he is
                                competent, it seems to me entirely proper that the Board should have
                                authority to appoint another Superintendent.
                            Mr. NEBEKER. Is there no mechanic there?
                            M. SHERMAN. None whatever in connection with the Northern prison that
                                I know of.
                            Mr. McLEAN. The amendment of the gentleman from Laporte, [Mr.
                                Sherman] seems to be all right, and there may be propriety in it;
                                but it is not germain to the bill. A builder cannot properly be said
                                to be an officer of the prison, and an amendment providing that the
                                Board shall employ a master builder - one not strictly an officer -
                                would certainly not be germain to the bill.
                            Mr. SHERMAN. We do not propose to make him an officer. It is only
                                extending the prerogative of the Board.
                            The SPEAKER [Mr. Bundy.] The amendment is not in order as the bill
                                stands. It contemplates the creation of a new office.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Bartholomew. I hope there will be no factious
                                opposition to this bill, because I am satisfied that, without it
                                passes, the  the prison
                                appropriations heretofore made will be a loss to the State. The
                                committee found that the salaries of the officers were a little
                                above $13,000, and this bill reduces them to a little over $6,000.
                                The calculations have been very carefully made.
                            Mr. LANE. Mr. Speaker, I wish to withdraw my amendment, and move to
                                recommit the bill, with instructions to reduce the Warden's salary
                                to $1,500, and the salary of the Board of Control to $600 each. 1
                                think that would probably meet the views of the House, and do
                                justice to our constituents.
                            Mr. PROSSER. Mr. Speaker, the bill proposes to employ "a minister of
                                the gospel, in good standing." I do not understand that exactly. I
                                know it is a common saying that a certain minister is in good
                                standing with his own party, but I want the thing more definite. If
                                it is meant by this that he must be a man of good moral character,
                                so far as that is concerned it is all right. I propose, then, to
                                change it, and say, "the minister shall be a man of good moral
                                character."
                            VOICES. "Consent," "Consent."
                            Mr. BUNDY. I hope the gentleman from Putnam, [Mr. Lane] will withdraw
                                the motion to recommit. I esteem it a death blow to the bill,
                                especially the instructions of my friend from Brown, [Mr. Prosser.]
                                If such instructions be referred it will certainly go to the tomb of
                                the Capulets. If it is desirable to equalize the salaries in the two
                                prisons by reducing them, that can easily be brought up in a
                                separate bill.
                            Mr. FISHER. It has occurred to me in this matter of the salaries of
                                these officers, that the Attorney General holds that there is no
                                Warden of the Northern prison, but a "Superintendent." I suppose,
                                therefore, we ought to say in the bill "Warden or Superintendent." I
                                propose that amendment.
                            It was adopted by consent.
                            On motion by Mr. STOTSENBERG, Mr. Lane's motion was laid on the
                                table.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG then demanded the previous question, and under its
                                force the bill was considered as engrossed and passed the third and
                                last reading in the House of Representatives yeas 84, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            THE PRISON APPROPRIATIONS.
                            Mr. FISHER, from the Committee on Ways and Means,
                                returned Mr. Veatch's prison appropriations bill [39] described on page 119 of
                                the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS, filling the blanks with $30,000 and
                                the first blank for the month of January, 1861, with the word
                                "eight" and the second with the words "five hundred."
                            Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker - I hope gentlemen will suppress their
                                exclamations of "still harping upon my daughter," which may be
                                pressing for utterance as I rise to make a few observations upon
                                this bill. Sir, I became disgusted with this gentleman of the
                                Northern Prison, during the regular session; and I had resolved in
                                my own mind that during this called session I would not say a word
                                upon this question of the Northern Prison, unless I should be amply
                                paid for it [Laughter.] I trust, however, that no gentleman will
                                infer from this remark that I have received a fee for what I am now
                                about to offer. But, sir the friends of that institutionmy
                                constituents- demand of me that I should once more represent their
                                wishes upon this floor. During the regular session, it will be
                                recollected, that I stood as the peculiar champion of the Northern
                                Prison. It was expected of me that whenever any chimera or shadow of
                                an idea might find expression from the cranium of the gentleman from
                                Allen [Mr. Jenkinson] I was to oppose it. And while the name of the
                                Northern Prison was a bye word of reproach - when it had become
                                odious in the ears of many, I was compelled to stand up and bear the
                                    onus, when there was "none so poor as to do it
                                reverence."
                            Hence, I resolved never to say " Northern prison" here again. But I
                                am compelled, by the wants of my constituents, to say a few words
                                now. The bill proposes that 200 convicts, in addition to those
                                already there, shall be taken from the Southern to the Northern
                                prison. I am aware that these prejudices against the Northern Prison
                                - if they were prejudices - might have been well founded. They
                                originated in the start- in the first motion to constitute two
                                penitentiaries in the State. Again, there was opposition or
                                prejudice - and that perhaps was not wholly unfounded - against the
                                location of the prison. But now we have passed these ordeals. We
                                have expended money in the institution, and the Northern prison has
                                become a fixed fact. It has been an ordeal, sir, that I would not
                                like to pass through again. And I will ask gentlemen now not to
                                allow their prejudices to blind them to their duty. This institution
                                now is a fixed fact; and, whatever be the cost, we are compelled to
                                support our prisoners - we are compelled to provide for the support
                                and safe-keeping of the legal convicts of the State of Indiana. I
                                ask gentlemen to consider dispassionately what has been the past
                                policy of the State. The bill proposes to send 200 convicts more to
                                the Northern prison, and provides for the clothing, care and
                                safe-keeping of these prisoners, together with the one hundred
                                already there, with an appropriation of $13,000. Let us look at
                                this. I have taken pains to make a little figuring. I find that the
                                keeping of 300 convicts - and there will be 24 more than this
                                number, but these will do for the allowance which we should make for
                                the reduction of their number by discharges - I find that the
                                feeding, clothing, &c., is 21 cents a day for each convict. I
                                undertake to say they can be kept for this money, but the
                                commissioners say they can't. I give my own opinion, not the opinion
                                of others. I find, then, that the sum is $22,115 for the feeding,
                                clothing, &c., of 300 prisoners, for one year. I find still
                                further, that, according to present prices, it will cost $12,000 a
                                year to guard 300 convicts. And I find the present proposed salaries
                                to be about $7,000 a year. The sum of  these is $40,995. The bill proposes to
                                reduce salaries of these commissioners some little over $1,000. At
                                the same time it proposes to add to the salary of the Warden about
                                $300. Then the restriction of the pay of the guards may reduce the
                                sum of their compensation to $995. With these reductions and
                                additions, the sum of the expenses is $41,000 for one year. This
                                appropriation in the bill, then, of $30,000, is entirely inadequate.
                                Perhaps it would be asking too much to ask gentlemen for an increase
                                of this appropriation, for it seems to be regarded already as a
                                stretch of liberality, and that the House would not be pilling to
                                increase it. But gentlemen will see that these $30,000, with $11,000
                                more, make just $41,000. Then where is the fund to come from which
                                the Warden or commissioners are compelled to pay to each convict
                                when his time expires, $16 each?
                            Mr. SMITH, of Bartholomew, (interposing.) We have made this
                                appropriation of $30,000 for eight months' time - from the first of
                                June to the first of February, 1862.
                            Mr. SHERMAN. That is so much better. This opposition to the Northern
                                prison, Mr. Speaker, which was so strong an argument two years ago,
                                has been strikingly illustrated by the present crisis. The sale of
                                the products of the labor and manufactories of the convicts of the
                                Southern prison have been dependent on the Louisville market; and
                                now we have cut that off. Hence this Southern prison must continue
                                its daily expenses without return to the State, If we have no other
                                place for the convicts. But now, in this Northern prison there is an
                                opportunity afforded whereby the State may still avail herself of
                                the convict labor, if this House will make an appropriation
                                sufficient to purchase materials. Notwithstanding the condition of
                                the money market, labor is as valuable to-day as under any
                                circumstances. Then let us not be "penny wise and pound foolish." If
                                you take these prisoners to the Northern prison without
                                appropriating anything but what is necessary to feed and subsist
                                them, and pay the officers and guards, they will still be nothing
                                but an expense to the State. I find by the estimates that it will
                                require yet, $1,500,000 to complete the walls of that prison. When
                                these walls shall be finished, one-half of the expense of guards
                                will be cut off. It will cut off half a million of the burthen. The
                                cost of clay which will be necessary will be $187. This day is to be
                                freighted some seven or eight miles. This, I undertake to say, is
                                less than it would cost for carting it one-fourth of a mile. Here
                                then is the expense for the clay and the grading on the railroad, to
                                deliver the clay in the yard - this, with the transportation, is
                                $2,000. Again, it will require 96 cord of ruble stone to complete
                                the foundation. The cost of these stone is estimated at $240. It
                                will require 230 yards of dimension stone for making the casings. I
                                estimate this at $2.50 at the quarry. I cannot estimate the expense
                                of transportation. I could not figure that without knowing what a
                                yard of this stone would weigh. But we have a contract for
                                transportation, which is better than any that can now be made with
                                the Michigan Central R. R. Co. We have a contract with this central
                                road to transport all the materials at one cent per tun per mile,
                                which is one-third less than ordinary prices. The State can compel
                                this road to live up to this contract. Now, if you make the proper
                                appropriations, you can apply the convict labor to advantage. But
                                there must be additional provisions made for keeping these
                                prisoners. They are now kept in the work shop, one room of which is
                                fitted up for cells; that is, they have no cells, but mere slips for
                                the cots, one above another. In case the Legislature should be
                                inclined to do anything for the cell house, they will be compelled
                                to vote an appropriation for another cell house, or these additional
                                prisoners will have to occupy the entire additional space of the
                                cell shops for cells. You must appropriate and provide for building
                                a wing for the cell house. Now, I find that all this will require
                                694,000 brick; and for the offices which will have to be in
                                connection with this wing, there will have to be provided 109,000
                                more brick, making an additional appropriation necessary of at least
                                $4,500. If you will not do this, I can not see how they can obtain
                                the means to manufacture even so much as a bedstead. I present
                                merely the condition in which these gentlemen are now placed, not
                                wishing to inflict a speech upon the House, unless we make these
                                appropriations toward completing these buildings, costing some
                                seventy or seventy-five thousand dollars. But if we do this, we
                                shall then have complete accommodations sufficient for 380 convicts.
                                I present these considerations that gentlemen may see what we are
                                doing. If you vote but $30,000, you vote for barely enough to clothe
                                and subsist the convicts, and they will be kept there at a dead
                                expense. I therefore move to strike out the "$30,000," and make it
                                "$60,000," if this appropriation is for one year.
                            Mr. CRAIN. This committee, Mr. Speaker, have reported an amount which
                                they can not extend beyond the appropriation as we have brought it
                                in. I was a long time, sir, before I could bring myself to the point
                                of willingness to bring it up to that point. It was upon a careful
                                calculation and analysis of all the facts and estimates reported to
                                us that we put down that amount. And this amount is calculated to
                                feed and clothe and take care of the prisoners for the present
                                fiscal year; also for the purpose of procuring materials for
                                carrying on the work. To my mind the bill appropriates a sum which
                                the present condition of the State will not permit us to pass; and I
                                am satisfied it is useless to attempt to pass any greater
                                appropriation. It may be necessary to remove the prisoners from the
                                South-  ern prison; and in case
                                that is done it becomes absolutely necessary that the appriation of
                                $30,000 should be made for the purpose of carrying on the work. If,
                                on the contrary, we should conclude to remove but one hundred
                                prisoners then this sum will not be necessary. But if it should be
                                necessary to remove two hundred, then the appropriation of the
                                $30,000 must be made. This is a matter for the House to determine.
                                In case the House determines to remove two hundred prisoners it will
                                be necessary to make the appropriation there set down, to carry on
                                till next February. Then there is an appropriation already made for
                                1862. With that the Directors will complete the walls of the prison
                                in this time. Then we expect, when the walls shall be completed,
                                that the machine will be somewhat self-sustaining. It will be
                                recollected that we have made another appropriation for 1862 to keep
                                the prisoners, which embraces $10,000 for the purchase of materials.
                                We expect that the completion of the walls will enable us to reduce
                                the number of guards. This we have estimated; and we have reduced
                                several other items as we have conceived to be safe right. If the
                                State was in a different situation he would be willing to make
                                appropriations to complete the work at once. But it was now in no
                                better pecuniary condition than it was last winter. And he proposed
                                the policy then adopted - to hasten slowly and build with convict
                                labor. Under all the circumstances this prison appropriation was as
                                high as the State could stand. The appropriations already made would
                                require all the revenue, and an additional appropriation would
                                require an additional tax. We must look carefully to the financial
                                ability of the State. He advised, disinterestedly, as his position
                                in the State indicated, that the gentleman from Laporte withdraw his
                                proposition, believing that, if successful, it would kill the
                                bill.
                            Mr. SHERMAN. I desire, Mr. Speaker, to reply to the idea that my
                                amendment would have a tendency to destroy the bill. I feel sensibly
                                the force of the old trueism that better is "half a loaf than no
                                bread." But I offer the amendment in good faith, as a matter of duty
                                to those whom I represent. I must do my duty, however burthensome it
                                may be. I have presented my views in the fairest light - for figures
                                can not lie - and members will be governed by them accordingly; and
                                I think they show conclusively that my amendment should be adopted.
                                I would state that the last January payment has been neglected. It
                                has not been paid at all. The Auditor has refused to audit the
                                accounts of the officers for the month of January, from the fact
                                that he takes the ground that the appropriations for the present
                                fiscal year (1861) commences with the month of February. For this
                                reason he has refused to audit the amount for January.
                            Mr. FISHER. One of the amendments provides for paying that out of
                                this appropriation. I have but little to say, Mr. Speaker, on this
                                matter. The committee feel the embarrassed condition of the State.
                                They are conscious of the fact that appropriations have already been
                                made reaching to the probably amount of the revenue for the coming
                                year, They were also made aware of the fact that owing to the
                                difficulties South, the convict labor in the Southern prison would
                                be entirely unproductive, and that there must be an appropriation
                                sufficient to take care of the prisoners or they must be turned
                                loose upon society; and that provision must be made for the work on
                                the Northern prison. Certainly the prisoners must be supported
                                somewhere. This must be done; and whether we have revenue enough or
                                not does not alter the case. The people of the State will justify
                                neither starving nor turning them loose. The committee came to the
                                conclusion that for the present it was necessary to transfer two
                                hundred prisoners more to the Northern prison, and to make provision
                                for the necessary materials to work upon. We set ourselves to work
                                to make estimates, and they were greatly below those made by the
                                Board. I would be willing myself to put $40,000 into that bill for
                                additional materials, if it could carry. But these $30,000, if
                                appropriated, will enable them to subsist the prisoners, and perhaps
                                furnish materials to work them during the year - till the first of
                                next February. Nothing is appropriated beyond that time. For next
                                year the appropriation made at the regular session of $25,000 may be
                                brought in.
                            Mr. ORR. Is that additional?
                            Mr. FISHER. Certainly. Of that appropriation of $25,000 for 1861,
                                $10,000 was for materials, leaving $15,000 for subsistence. We
                                understand that the Board had expended $6,000 of that $15,000. The
                                committee deliberated long and seriously, and came to the
                                conclusions reported. There are $8,000 or $10,000 in the amendments
                                reported. Perhaps before the coming session of Congress shall
                                adjourn further action will be necessary. The amendments ought to be
                                read in connection with the bill.
                            Mr. PARRETT. Mr. Speaker: I am not in the habit of resting my
                                judgment entirely upon the report of a committee; but in this case I
                                think good sense and good judgment would lead members of the House
                                to rely upon the report of this committee. Surrounding circumstances
                                would show us that the appropriation is cut down to as small a
                                figure as can be safely made, and that there is an absolute
                                necessity for it to be made. It is very clear that we ought not to
                                appropriate one cent more than we are obliged to. I think the
                                committee has examined the question thoroughly. It is a matter of
                                calculation, the elements of which no man can know exactly; and they
                                seem to have discharged their duty;  and I don't think discussion can help
                                them any. I therefore move the previous question.
                            There was a second to the demand for the previous question, and Mr.
                                Sherman's amendment was rejected.
                            The question then recurred on concurring in the report of the
                                committee and ordering the bill to be engrossed.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. Mr. Speaker: I desire to offer an amendment.
                            The SPEAKER (Mr. Bundy in the Chair). The previous question still
                                forces the vote upon the adoption of the report of the
                                committee.
                            Mr. DAVIS. What are you going to do for the expenses of the prison
                                next year? Are you going to have another called session?
                            A VOICE - There has been $25,000 appropriated for that. It is in the
                                bill of last winter.
                            Mr. DAVIS. That is for the prisoners already there.
                            Mr. HEFFREN (in his seat). Leave them to starve as they deserve.
                            The amendments of the committee were concurred in, and then on motion
                                by Mr. FISHER the bill was ordered to be engrossed.
                        
                        
                            THE REAL ESTATE REDEMPTION BILL.
                            Mr. VEATCH,from the Judiciary Committee, returned
                                Mr. Stotsenberg's real estate redemption bill [28] with an amendment by way
                                of substitute, [striking out all after the enacting clause and
                                inserting provisions to the effect that whenever real property shall
                                be sold on execution, the owner thereof may redeem the same any time
                                within one year, by paying the purchaser the purchase money, with
                                interest at ten per cent.; provided that in all cases where real
                                property so sold shall bring two-thirds of its valuation no
                                redemption shall be allowed. 2. When sold for less than two-thirds
                                the valuation, the sheriff shall execute to the purchaser a
                                certificate of purchase which shall entitle the holder to a deed at
                                the expiration of one year from the date thereof. It repeals
                                conflicting laws and contains an emergency clause.]
                            Mr. HEFFREN. That will apply to contracts and judgments already in
                                existence.
                            Mr. VEATCH. I suppose it will apply to every sale taking place after
                                the passage of this act.
                            Mr. COLLINS, of Whitley. Is there any provision for the mode of
                                process?
                            Mr. VEATCH. None whatever; because the present law provides for
                                that.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Suppose a judgment is rendered now without relief from
                                valuation or appraisement laws - most of our judgments are so
                                rendered - will this bill affect such judgment?
                            Mr. VEATCH. I can only give the gentleman an opinion. I understand
                                that this bill does not affect a contract, but you are entitled by
                                it to a change in your remedy. It does not disturb your sale, but it
                                provides relief against judgments and executions.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I put the case where judgment is had and execution
                                returned without re lief from valuation or appraisement laws, and
                                suppose the Sheriff has already levied on real estate, under the law
                                now as appraisement is necessary. Will this bill affect such an
                                execution?
                            Mr. VEATCH. Most unquestionably. Your sale will go on, but you will
                                not get a deed for one year.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Why then prescribe the appraisement?
                            Mr. VEATCH. Simply to prevent misconstruction.
                            Mr. FRASIER. It seems to me that there ought to be a provision in the
                                bill entitling the holders of subsequent heirs by mortgage or
                                judgment, or creditors generally, giving them the right to redeem. I
                                would like to propose to concur with that amendment: with a
                                provision for redemption on the part of subsequent creditors.
                            Mr. VEATCH. Mr. Speaker, it is proper to state that this bill is not
                                reported as the judgment of the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary, but as the judgment of the House. The
                                committee acted under the instruction of the House in reporting the
                                amendment. We took the bill as it was referred to us with certain
                                positive instructions, and we have acted as nearly in conformity
                                with the instructions as we knew how.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I suppose the committee make no report on the
                                constitutional question involved.
                            Mr. CASON. This is simply a report from the Judiciary
                                    Committee under instructions, and not a report so far
                                as any legal opinion of the committee is concerned.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I more to recommit the bill to the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary without
                                instructions, and let them report on it as they will.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. The proper course would be first to reconsider the vote
                                ordering the bill to be engrossed.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN. That vote was reconsidered on the day the bill was
                                recommitted.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. The record will show.
                            The Clerk read the journal, which showed that the bill had been
                                considered as engrossed, and then - On the motion of Mr. HEFFREN, by
                                unanimous consent, the vote ordering the engrossment was
                                reconsidered, and the bill was referred again to the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary.
                        
                        
                            COMMISSARY GENERAL MANSUR.
                            On the motion of Mr. CASON, the orders of the day were passed over,
                                and the House took up again the report of the Committee on
                                    the Commissary Department, and Mr. Cason, under
                                instructions from said committee, now submitted the testimony which
                                the committee had taken in the case.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG hoped the reading of the testimony would be dispensed
                                with, and made a motion to that effect.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Before we act, Mr. Speaker, the evidence should be read.
                                We should hear the testimony on which the report is based. After
                                that, I propose to submit a resolution requesting the Governor of
                                the State of Indiana to remove the present Commissary General from
                                his office for malfeasance. But the House should first hear the
                                testimony.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. Let us have it printed.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. If you wait for printing, it will take till the last of
                                next week, and you will  go
                                home without the action in this matter which justice to the soldiers
                                requires.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Bartholomew. What is the use of taking testimony, if we
                                do not hear it?
                            Mr. NEBEKER. The reading can not be dispensed with, if it is
                                demanded.
                            The SPEAKER, [Mr. Bundy.] The Chair so decides.
                            The testimony was then read by the Clerk. The reading occupied about
                                one hour, and when it was concluded -
                            The House took a recess till two o'clock P. M.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The House resumed the consideration of the report of the select
                                    committee on the Commissariat.
                            Mr. LEE moved that the report be concurred in, with the
                                following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Governor be
                                            requested to re move the present Commissary General for
                                            malfeasance in office.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. HEFFREN stated that the reason why the select committee made no
                                recommendation was because they were divided in sentiment. He did
                                know, of his own personal knowledge that some of the food they get
                                in camp out here, is unfit for white men to eat. There was a great
                                wrong somewhere, and gentlemen who have heard the testimony can tell
                                where it falls as well as the committee. The soldiers come here to
                                defend the government - to defend our rights and the rights of our
                                common country; and no man who eats such food can keep his physical
                                strength. He hoped the Legislature would consider the matter, and do
                                as the State of Ohio had done in a similar case.
                            Mr. CASON. The testimony embodied in the report does not fully show
                                everything connected with the matter, because the committee could
                                not examine the provisions. But they could converse with parties,
                                and understand the nature of the thing better than they could report
                                upon the testimony, and upon the books and papers. We have talked
                                with every company at Camp Morton, and a large number of companies
                                at the other Camps; and we have taken the testimony reported as the
                                average. As I look upon it, the gravest charge against the
                                Commissary is, that he furnished his own meat, and persistently
                                continued to do so; and the simple fact of his adulterating the
                                coffee without cause assigned, unless, it might be, because he could
                                sell it at 13 1/2 cents instead of the regular price. But there is
                                no evidence that either he or Tuttle made anything out of it.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. The Commissary distributed fourteen ounce packages as
                                pound packages.
                            Mr. CASON. The testimony is that the 12 ounce packages were weighed
                                in the gross and delivered according to weight, and the 14 ounce
                                packages were given out as pound packages. But if the Commissary
                                does his duty he makes nothing by these short allowances, because he
                                is charged by bills purchased; and he accounts to the State for
                                these bills, and receipts to the State for the money he pays out and
                                nothing more. The most important thing has not been investigated by
                                the committee It is this, they could not investigate the rations
                                distributed, from the fact that they were thrown together in the
                                books; and the clerk swears it would take a man two weeks to go over
                                the whole. There is great confusion in relation to the provisions on
                                hand, and the rations distributed; and it is impossible to say
                                whether the Commissary has converted any of the provisions to his
                                own use. The committee knows no more about that than the House. The
                                rations on hand cannot be looked into till the whole business of the
                                Commissary on hand shall be wound up - till he accounts fully to the
                                State for what he has done. Then you can compare the rations
                                distributed with the bills purchased. Here is the greatest chance
                                for fraud upon the State. The evidence is that the rations were
                                short, and the receipts executed were for full rations. I am not
                                here to make charges against the Commissary. But suppose he delivers
                                short and charges full rations he could make quite a difference in
                                his own favor. I don't say what he will do, or what he has done, I
                                simply make this statement to show the House that it is impossible
                                to affirm from what appears of what he did, whether or not there has
                                been fraud upon the State. We had the witnesses before us, and some
                                of the provisions, and we had conversation with the men, in order
                                that we might be prepared to form an opinion in relation to those
                                blank or duplicate receipts. We met it in this way. We charged that
                                they had been taking two receipts alike. We went to the Commissary
                                and he famished the vouchers. But if you observed the testimony you
                                found that a number of the men who sold the provisions kept, no
                                books at all, and sometimes they had not charged correctly what they
                                had sold. Then the number of the receipts were not all right; but it
                                generally happened 4hat when we told them the number was not right
                                they could furnish the missing receipts. There were no books except
                                the books of the Commissary, and from these vouchers warrant? were
                                drawn upon the Auditor. The Auditor was obliged to have them there.
                                But whether they were right we do not know, because the Commissary
                                withdrew them. When we came to these receipts we found some of the
                                second receipts were blank. Some of them were duplicates, but no
                                mark of duplicate on them. Part of them were signed in blank the
                                amounts blank. These were liable to be filled with any amount of
                                dollars and beef and bread. Then, when they were identical, there
                                was trouble about the question whether there might not have been two
                                bills of the same date for the same articles purchased the same day,
                                because there might have been one for Camp Morton, one for Camp
                                Sullivan, and another for the barracks. The men selling the bread
                                kept no books at all, except the  Steam Bakery. The same was the case with the beef men. He gave an
                                example in a voucher purporting to be executed by C. John, wherein
                                Mr. C. John swears that he has sold nothing to the Commissary, that
                                he is not engrtged in the baking business, &c.; and Mr. Mansur
                                supposes that his messenger wrote "C. John" on the bill because he
                                saw that name on the sign at the door; and which receipt Mr. Mansur
                                has withdrawn, and says he will throw them out of his account unless
                                he can get the matter straight. The testimony seemed to show
                                conclusively that Mr. Mansur had done wrong in furnishing his own
                                meat. He looked upon this as the worst feature in the whole
                                business, after investigating the whole matter. It should be taken
                                into view that Mr. Mansur had a great deal of trouble. But when it
                                comes to furnishing his own meat, with his brother's testimony as to
                                the quality of the meat, and then charging one-eight of a cent more
                                than the market price, there was much to be reprehended, and he
                                might be still continuing this up to the date of the report. There
                                had been purchases since from Cincinnati. The testimony that back
                                shoulders are most likely to spoil and become unsaleable, and that
                                    that description was furnished by Mr. Mansur; and
                                that no account of the amount was kept by Mansur's brother in items
                                except on slips of paper which are lost - these were all inscrutable
                                things. There was nothing to show the weight except the total
                                vouchers. There was no evidence except that of Mansur's brother that
                                it is all right - he himself swearing that no man living knows
                                anything about, it except himself. It might be that this is all
                                right, but why was not the Commissary more cautious? It was said of
                                the meat he had on commission, he counted the number of pieces, but
                                of his portion no particular account was kept. There was another
                                thing. There was found no evidence to show what has been donated to
                                the soldiers by their benevolent friends. The committee found
                                nothing satisfactory as to that only one voucher for freight paid on
                                certain things shipped to the soldiers on the Bellefontaine
                                Railroad. There would be trouble about this in the final settlement.
                                None of the books showing anything about it, and no possibility of
                                finding out anything about it except through the statements of the
                                Commissary. Another difficulty would be found in the fact that the
                                crackers were not numbered regularly. This was explained upon the
                                Commissary's plea of the confusion of things when he commenced
                                receiving and receipting rations.
                            Mr. NEBEKER. What remedy is there for the matter?
                            Mr. CASON. I suspect the only remedy, if there is any remedy, is to
                                let out the job of furnishing our troops to the lowest bidder,
                                throwing guards around the contract in such a way as that the
                                soldiers shall have their proper rations, and the State shall not be
                                defrauded. Another thirty about the amount of the rations. The
                                Commissary, in his report, states that 34 cents a day should be
                                furnished to the men. Some of the articles specified by him he has
                                never furnished. He has lacked a great deal of coming up to his own
                                estimates. He says he is satisfied now that his estimate was too
                                high, and that Lieut. Davis has set down the value of the army
                                ration at sixteen cents.
                            Mr. Heffren here read that portion of the testimony relative to the
                                want of full weight in the ground coffee furnished.
                            Mr. ORR. I observe the gentleman from Porter [Mr. Cameron] in his
                                seat, and as he has been partaking of the camp fare lately, I would
                                be glad to have a statement from him.
                            Mr CAMERON. Mr. Speaker, I know nothing about these matters of
                                complaint. As far as bad meat and bad hams there are concerned, I
                                have never seen any I have seen none of it. I know that which we
                                have had to have been the very best I ever saw, and I profess to be
                                a judge. I have seen as good side meat there as I ever eat in my
                                life, and I know I am a judge of such articles. [Laughter.] In
                                regard to the quantity, at first it was more abundant than it is
                                now. Some days when the boys drill very hard their appetites are
                                good and they are apt to ear the more. The noon meal now is not much
                                more than, half a meal. This is a sanitary precaution. While we were
                                furnished by the State it was not so. Then the boys were never
                                hungry. No complaint was made except in the case of dried apples. We
                                had one barrel bad. There were a few worms in it. As to the coffee,
                                the first that was furnished was ground coffee, and it was poor -
                                such as you get everywhere in the groceries, and there was a great,
                                deal of grumbling and complaint about it. And then we were furnished
                                with green coffee which we browned and ground for ourselves which
                                was good.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. Mr. Speaker, I should have voted for the resolution
                                of the gentleman from Vigo [Mr. Lee] with much more satisfaction if
                                the committee had reported it; and if they had closed their report
                                with a statement of their conviction that this man had been guilty
                                of malfeasance in office. I suppose the resolution ought to set out
                                the fact. Sir, we can only judge this case by the matter of the
                                report of the committee, taken in connection with the testimony. We
                                ought not to go beyond that. And, sir, in coming to my conclusions
                                upon the matter, I desire to be governed solely by what the
                                committee has stated. But then the committee have taken care to
                                explain away very much.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Does the gentleman propose to screen himself behind the
                                non-action of the committee?
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. No sir. I take the testimony and the statement. I
                                understand this report to have been unanimous. And in  addition to the testimony, we have the
                                statements of members here, who also have had the benefit of outside
                                conversation. The committee close their report with a palliatory
                                remark upon the haste with which the troops were brought together,
                                &c., which must render mistakes unavoidable; and that no person
                                connected with the Commissary Department ought to be censured for
                                mere mistakes which have occurred there through ignorance, fraud or
                                negligence.
                            Mr. HEFFREN, (in his seat.) Mistakes that have occurred through
                                fraud. [Laughter.]
                            Mr STOTSENBERG. That is the language of the report. But the report
                                carries out the idea, and so do the remarks of the gentleman from
                                Boone and Hendricks, [Mr. Cason,] that this man has proved himself
                                incompetent for the duties of his office; and I shall most
                                cheerfully vote for the resolution on that ground.
                            Mr. CASON. We thought it best simply to set out the testimony, then
                                base our statement upon that, and leave it so. The House is just as
                                competent to come to conclusions as we are.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. I am clearly satisfied of one thing. That the man is
                                clearly incompetent for his position. I move to amend the resolution
                                by striking; out the word "malfeasance " and inserting these words
                                in lieu thereof, "incompetency in the discharge of the duties of his
                                office."
                            Mr. LEE. I accept the amendment.
                            Mr. FRASIER. I am willing to vote for that. The Commissary-General is
                                a stranger to me; and I could look with allowance upon a great deal
                                of bungling, considering the circumstances and the hurry with which
                                these troops were got into the city, and the mistakes that would be
                                likely to often in the case. But upon hearing the testimony I could
                                not consider it the business of the committee to construe the
                                testimony for us. The gentleman from Floyd [Mr. Stotsenberg] seems
                                to think we are bound by the conclusions of the committee.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. I said taken in connection with the testimony.
                            Mr. FRASIER. That certainly explains the thing away more than the
                                committee does. I repeat, sir, that I could look complacently upon a
                                great deal of bungling if I supposed that this man had an honest
                                purpose. But, from two or three indications which I gather from the
                                report, I do not feel willing that he should longer be entrusted
                                with the discharge of the duties of this office. The fact of the
                                double receipts are soon explained before the committee, or to the
                                satisfaction of the House. I thought at one time that the gentleman
                                must have been wholly unaccustomed to business transactions, but I
                                am informed that he is a shrewd, sharp business man. ["That's a
                                fact." "That's true."] Now, in connection with that we have a right
                                to demand and expect an explanation from him ; and the proper place
                                for that to come was before the committee. It has not been made;
                                therefore, I shall certainly vote for this resolution. I say nothing
                                about the poor coffee, &c., and if there is anything in the way
                                of edibles that I dislike more than any thing else it is poor coffee
                                - and God knows that I have had enough of that in this city.
                                [Laughter.] And I have no patience at all with the default about
                                keeping books, so that in the final settlement no power on earth can
                                secure the State from being cheated out of thousands of dollars.
                            Mr. NEBEKER. Will the gentleman tell us whether a pork dealer will
                                sell out his own pork without keeping accounts?
                            Mr. FRASIER. I am not a pork dealer, sir; but I think if I were
                                employing a man to do such business I should want to be a little
                                more particular about it. And I wish here to look into the interests
                                of the State just as I would regard my own interests. They may claim
                                that it is all right for a man to put upon soldiers an inferior
                                quality of meat and reserve the best, instead of going into the
                                market and giving opportunities for a fair competition; but I am not
                                of that opinion. There is also a similar inconsistency in the fact
                                that the meat sold by him for the soldiers was that which is most
                                likely to spoil, and that which dealers are most desirous to get off
                                their hands. It is a painful duty for me to be compelled to pass a
                                public censure upon any man; but, sir, it is a stern duty which we
                                all have to discharge sometimes, and which we can not get rid of
                                here, unless we are willing to be direlect in our own duty. I hope,
                                Mr. Speaker, from what I have heard within an hour or two, that
                                there will be a like investigation had in connection with our
                                Quartermaster Department. And I will cull attention to one fact
                                about that. I was informed last night by a gentleman who is a
                                graduate of one of the military schools of Europe that the powder
                                which has been purchased by the Quartermaster is not fit for use. I
                                want to know, sir, if that is the kind of material that is going to
                                be given to our soldiers to go out to fight with.
                            Mr. ORR. Will the gentleman be kind enough to explain before he sits
                                down why it is that there is nothing to show what has become of the
                                private donations to the soldiers?
                            Mr FRASIER. I can't tell.
                            Mr. PROSSER. I am very sorry the gentleman from Floyd [Mr.
                                Stotsenberg,] is so fearful of treading on somebody's toes. I am
                                sorry the resolution has been changed. I believe now, from what I
                                have heard, that the Commissary General is not an incompetent man. I
                                believe his course, to be properly styled, is malfeasance. A man who
                                will do what it is testified here he has done, may be incompetent,
                                but, sir, he has been acting the scoundrel.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. I understand from the committee, and what has been
                                stated by the gentleman from Boone, [Mr. Cason,] that they  do not believe the Commissary
                                has made money out of the State.
                            Mr. PROSSER. I believe he has. I believe he has lined his pockets
                                well. If he had acted right, why did he go to the Auditor's office
                                and wthdraw those vouchers, when he knew the committee were after
                                them? I move to insert again, after the word "incompetency," the
                                words "and malfeasance."
                            The amendment was adopted by consent. - Mr. PROSSER. Now I move the
                                previous question.
                            There being a second to the demand for the previous question.
                            The report of the committee was concurred in, and Mr. Lee's
                                resolution as amended was adopted-yeas 70, nays 0, 2 present and not
                                voting.
                            On motion of Mr. CASON, it was -
                            Ordered, That 200 copies of this report, including
                                the testimony, be printed for the use of the House of
                                Representatives.

                            
                                STATE MILITARY DEPOT.
                                On motion of Mr. LANE, the order of business was suspended to
                                    enable him to introduce the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That a committee of five
                                                be appointed to ascertain whether a suitable
                                                building can be procured to be used as headquarters
                                                for the ordnance and quartermaster department; also
                                                suitable for a military depot, arsenal or armory,
                                                and report by bill or otherwise.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                The resolution was adopted.
                                The SPEAKER appointed Messrs. Lane, Cameron, Crane, Stotsenberg
                                    and Orr to serve as the special committee under the
                                    resolution.
                            
                            
                                LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR MAJOR HEFFREN.
                                Mr. HEFFREN. Mr. Speaker: I ask to be excused from further
                                    service in the special committee on the Commissary and
                                    Quartermaster Department. I make this application now because it
                                    is necessary that some one should take ray place at once. I am
                                    also under the necessity of asking to be excused from further
                                    service in the House of Representatives, on account of a demand
                                    for my services in another field of labor. The Governor of the
                                    State, without my solicitation, has tendered to me a major's
                                    commission in the thirteenth regiment, and henceforth my duty
                                    will be in another field. Therefore I desire to be excused from
                                    service here for the remainder of the session.
                                Mr. Heffren was excused by unanimous consent, and the Speaker
                                    appointed Mr. Prosser to his place on the special committee.
                            
                            
                                FOURTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.
                                Mr. WOODHULL, from the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary, returned Mr. Collins of Whitley's
                                    Judicial circuit bill [40] with an amendment and a
                                    recommendation that the same do pass. [The amendment proposes to
                                    strike out all after the enacting clause and to take from the
                                    Tenth Judicial Circuit the counties of Lagrange, Steuben, Noble,
                                    De Kalb, and Allen, and constitute them as the Fourteenth
                                    Judicial Circuit, with the usual provisions in such a bill.]
                                Mr. NEBEKER moved to lay the bill on the table, but immediately
                                    withdrew the motion.
                                Mr. FRASIER. Mr. Speaker: I have voted, together with every other
                                    member from the Tenth Congressional District, in the north east
                                    part of the State, for every court bill that has been asked for
                                    in other portions of the State in order to get their judicial
                                    system in such a shape as to secure the ends of justice. I have
                                    been disposed to accommodate all. The situation in Which we are
                                    placed is this: We have got the largest judicial circuit in the
                                    State - it it composed of ten counties. It was
                                    created when the population was sparce and the business small.
                                    Ten years ago it answered very well. I ask attention to the last
                                    census, which shows the increase of our population, which can
                                    not fail of itself to convince gentlemen of the necessity and
                                    justice of this bill. The circuit embraces the entire Tenth
                                    Congressional District and two counties more - Adams and Wells.
                                    We have over 150,000 inhabitants in that one judicial circuit. I
                                    will merely state facts for the consideration of the House. In
                                    the county of Allen matters have come to such a crisis that
                                    there are cases on the circuit court docket there which can not
                                    be tried for three years to come. And unless this change is
                                    made, or some other, it is impossible that justice can done. In
                                    the county where I live, [Kosciusko] which is about an average
                                    county, we have not been able to have the docket called through
                                    for four years; and if the House refuse to pass this bill, and
                                    in the event that the bill introduced by the gentleman from Knox
                                    [Mr. Speaker Allen] does not pass - and I fear it will not - it
                                    amounts simply to a denial of justice to our people. I ask of
                                    gentlemen from other sections of the State to be as liberal
                                    toward us as we have been toward them. Whenever they have
                                    desired it we have been willing to come forward and grant them
                                    the relief they have asked. And now for the last three years
                                    this circuit has been asked for by our people - it is a thing
                                    that is imperatively demanded by the people. And I can not
                                    conceive why we should not have the same rights, privileges and
                                    immunities extended to us that we are willing to extend to other
                                    portions of the State. I claim it as right, and I ask gentlemen
                                    not to be so particularly anxious to smother down our rights as
                                    to lay this bill on the table at this late day in the
                                    session.
                                Mr. WOODHULL. It ill becomes a gentleman whose judicial circuit
                                    numbers not more than 43,000 inhabitants to get up and move to
                                    lay on the table a proposition to divide a district which will
                                    leave over 73,000 inhabitants in each division. We have in our
                                    county an average of over one hundred cases on the docket at
                                    each term, a number which no man can try and do justice to both
                                    parties. Our judge has forty weeks of service, and if we were to
                                    increase the number of weeks in each county, it would carry his
                                    term beyond the time of one year. If I thought the bill would be
                                    passed abolishing the common pleas court, I would not say a word
                                    for this bill. The idea of get-  ting rid of the heavy tax entailed
                                    by the common pleas court would induce me to forego the
                                    advantage of this divison, with all the justice of its claims.
                                    And there is justice in this bill. Our circuit was made ten
                                    years ago, when our population was not half what it is now. I do
                                    not place this claim so much upon the ground that we have been
                                    voting for the claims of other portions of the State, but I
                                    place it on th ground of simple justice and right.
                                Mr. NEBEKER. I moved in good faith to lay this bill on the table,
                                    and I withdrew it for the gentleman from Kosciusko, [Mr.
                                    Frasier.] Two speeches have been made, charging me with
                                    illiberality. But there was a district in which Terre Haute is
                                    situated which called loudly for a division last session. I do
                                    not know whether those gentlemen up north voted for it or
                                    not.
                                Mr. WOODHULL. I think that was a common pleas district, and I
                                    voted for it.
                                Mr. NEBEKER. I am speaking of circuits. And my friend from
                                    Vermillion, [Mr. Jones] here, not now in his seat, also failed
                                    in getting his ill. Upon his solicitation I stood aside once,
                                    and permitted the wrong to be done; but I afterwards came back
                                    and helped to undo it. But I say the circuit in which Terre
                                    Haute is situated - the largest in the State - asked for a
                                    division, and I ask why courtesy was not extended in that
                                    instance?
                                Mr. FRASIER. The influence of the gentleman from Warren [Mr.
                                    Nebeker] so overshadowed us.
                                Mr. WOODHULL. I say that the tenth circuit has thirty thousand
                                    inhabitants, more than any other district in the State.
                                Mr. NEBEKER, Well, 30,000 is not much of a sprinkle these times -
                                    thirty thousand inhabitants is nothing to the great Wabash
                                    region. I tell the gentleman to elect such judge as we have, and
                                    he will work up his docket clean, and not be increasing the
                                    expenses of the State by making new judicial circuits
                                    needlessly. Then this race for vote - is it fair, or right, or
                                    proper, that these gentlemen should come in here and threaten to
                                    abolish an entire system of courts unless we split up their
                                    circuits for them? Is it right for such gentlemen to charge
                                    discourtesy upon us?
                                Mr. ORR moved to lay the bill on the table; but he also withdrew
                                    for -
                                Mr. COLLINS of Whitley. There is no necessity for crimination
                                    here, Mr. Speaker. We are asking for what we regard as a simple,
                                    absolute necessity. We have a large circuit there, with business
                                    that cannot be done by a single judge. We failed at the regular
                                    session, from the fact that we then hoped the common pleas
                                    system would be abolished, and save $75,000 or $100,000 a year
                                    to the State. That bill having failed, and it being now doubtful
                                    whether it can pass, we ask again to have this circuit divided.
                                    I know it is a time when all the funds of the State are needed
                                    for other purposes, but this demand is absolute, and I would not
                                    ask it if it were not so. I believe it to be absolutely
                                    necessary, in order that justice may be done.
                                Mr. SMITH of Bartholomew, thought the bill should go before the
                                    proper committee.
                                The SPEAKER. The bill has just come from the Judiciary
                                        Committee.
                                Mr. SMITH. Then I move to postpone the subject, and that it be
                                    made the special order for Monday, 2 o'clock P. M.
                                On motion by Mr. DOBBINS, the House took up the calendar of
                                    Senate messages.
                                The street railroad bill [S. 28] was passed the first reading.
                                The official garnishment bill [S. 26] was passed the first
                                    reading.
                                The old county seat seminary bill [S. 27] was passed the first
                                    reading.
                            
                            
                                SEWERS AND DRAINS.
                                On motion of Mr. HENRICKS, the Committee's Sewers and Drains bill
                                    [H. R. 32] was taken up;
                                    and on his further motion, the vote ordering said bill to
                                    engrossment was reconsidered, and the bill was referred to a
                                    Select Committee of Three; whereupon the SPEAKER appointed
                                    Messrs. Henricks, Anderson and Harvey said committee.
                            
                            
                                LANDLORD'S LIEN.
                                On motion by Mr. EDSON, the landlord's lien bill S. 30 was taken
                                    up.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG. I am satisfied that bill is unconstitutional in
                                    its present shape. But if it is constitutional, I contend that
                                    landlords in cities and towns should just as well have a lien on
                                    the property of the lessee as the landlord in the rural
                                    districts. This bill, my friend says, has been before the
                                        Committee on Agriculture. Suppose it has,
                                    still it has not the stamp of approval from a legal committee.
                                    Respectable as I know the Committee to be, I submit that there
                                    is a special propriety in sending this bill to the
                                        Judiciary Committee - a bill creating a
                                    lien which seems almost directly in defiance of one of the
                                    guarantees of the Constitution. I move to recommit the bill with
                                    instructions to amend by extending the lien as I have
                                    indicated.
                                Mr. EDSON. I shall oppose this amendment from the fact that I am
                                    opposed to everything like ryders offered merely to embarrass a
                                    proposition. This is a bill in which I feel a deep interest. It
                                    has been now twice passed by the Senate, and I believe that the
                                    Senate has as good legal talent as will be found in our
                                        Judiciary Committee. If the gentleman
                                    were sincere in his intention to refer, it does seem to me he
                                    would not insist upon his instructions to amend. I would vote
                                    for his amendment as a separate bill; and if there is any doubt
                                    about the constitutional question, I would be willing to have
                                    this bill referred to the Judiciary
                                    Committee. But I am afraid that other than
                                    constitutional questions will be mooted against it if it goes
                                    there. And then I believe it has been already once before that
                                    committee.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG disclaimed any purpose to embarrass the bill.
                                    There were different kinds of liens, but that which he proposed
                                    was not diverse from the bill.
                            
                        
                    
                
                
                

                    BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                    BY ARIEL, & W. H. DRAPIER.
                    
                        Vol. V.
                        INDIANAPOLIS, MAY 28, 1861.
                        NO. 12.
                    
                    

                        
                            Mr. KENDRICK. I also will claim that physicians shall have the right
                                to "lean" on their patients. [Laughter.]
                            Mr. ORR. I can't vote for the bill in its present shape. I hope it
                                will go to the committee. I can not see the reason why a landlord
                                should have a right to lien which another man has not.
                            Mr. ATKISSON. Are we not all supported from mother earth; and without
                                its proper cultivation how can we live? [Laughter.]
                            Mr. ORR. Not very well, sir, I confess.
                            The bill was referred to the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary, with the following instructions:
                            Insert after the word ''law," Section 1: "And whenever any houses or
                                tenements have been or may be let, reserving rent, without personal
                                or other security being exacted, the owner or owners may have a lien
                                upon the personal property of the rentee or lessee for the amount of
                                the rent reserved or bargained for, not exceeding one year's
                                rent."
                        
                        
                            HIGHWAYS.
                            Mr. ANDERSON, by leave, introduced a bill [57] to provide for the
                                location, change or vacation of public highways; for the assessment
                                of damages sustained by such location, change or vacation ; and to
                                repeal sections 15 to 26 of an act to provide for the location,
                                change or vacation of highways, approved June 19, 1852.
                        
                        
                            INSANE AND BLIND ASYLUMS.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Benevolent Institutions be directed to
                                            inquire into the expediency of reporting a bill
                                            regulating the salaries of the Insane and Blind
                                            Asylums.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The House then, at 4 1/4 o'clock, adjourned till Monday morning, 9
                                o'clock.
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            MONDAY, May 27, 1861
                        
                        Mr. ODELL presented a petition from members of the bar in Carroll county,
                            praying for a change in the time of holding the several courts in the
                            llth judicial circuit.
                        Mr. ODELL. I believe there is a bill already introduced by Mr. De Hart
                            that meets the views of these petitioners entirely. I do not know as
                            there is any necessity for referring it. It only shows the feeling of
                            the petitioners.
                        Mr. DeHART. The bill I introduced a few days ago meets this petition
                            exactly, and on the motion of the Senator from Wabash, [Mr. Conner] it
                            was referred to the Committee on the Organization of
                                Courts, and I do not know the reason why it has not been
                            reported. I think it a great injustice to the bar of Carroll and Cass
                            counties to be kept off from the Supreme Court when this injustice can
                            be remedied by the passage of this bill. I would be glad if that
                            committee would make a report, either favorable or adversely - if the
                            bill can be defeated, we want it done fairly. As the law now stands, the
                            bar of Carroll and Cass counties are prohibited from attending the
                            Supreme Court.
                        Mr. CONNER. The bill alluded to was referred to the Committee on
                                the Organization of Courts, of which I have the honor to
                            be chairman. My county, or one of the counties I represent, the county
                            of Wabash, is in that judicial circuit. I stated to the Senator from
                            Cass [Mr. De Hart] that before making a report on the bill I desired to
                            hear from the members of the bar of Wabash county. I suppose that
                            explanation will; be entirely satisfactory to the gentleman. It proposes
                            to affect the time and I mit the term in my own county. I have not yet
                            heard from home but expect to to day or to-morrow; after that
                            I shall be prepared to call the committee together, and shall do it.
                            There is no intention to defeat the bill by delay. If I were to report
                            it now, I should report adversely. While I have every disposition to
                            accommodate every county in the circuit, as a matter of course I desire
                            to have some regard to the convenience of the district I represent.
                        The petition was referred to the Committee on the Organization
                                of Courts.
                        
                            CAVALRY AND ARTILLERY.
                            Mr. MILLER, from the Committee on Military
                                Affairs, returned the resolution of the Senate inquiring
                                into the expediency of authorizing the Governor to accept one
                                regiment of cavalry and three battalions ot artillery in addition to
                                the six regiments of infantry already raised, recommending that it
                                lie upon the table, the committee being of opinion that legislation
                                upon the subject is unnecessary.

                            On motion of Mr. MURRAY, and without objection, it was -
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Federal Relations be and they are
                                            hereby instructed to report a concurrent resolution to
                                            the Senate expressive of the sentiments of the
                                            Legislature of the State of Indiana on the melancholy
                                            and untimely death of Col. Ellsworth at Alexandria, D.
                                            C., where he was basely assassinated by a secessionist
                                            for having hauled down a flag of the secession forces of
                                            that place.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            ELEVENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.
                            Mr. DE HART offered the following; which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Organization of  Courts be instructed to
                                            report, without further delay, upon the bill entitled,
                                            "A bill to fix the time of holding courts in the
                                            Eleventh Judicial Circuit."
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was rejected.
                        
                        
                            PUBLICATION OF THE DELINQENT TAX LIST.
                            On motion by Mr. TEEGARDEN, it was -
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on the Judiciary be requested to inquire
                                            into the expediency of so amending the law in relation
                                            to the collection of taxes making it the duty of the
                                            Auditor to publish the delinquent list in a newspaper,
                                            where one is published in the county in which the lands
                                            are situated.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            RAILROADS.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB, from the Judiciary Committee,
                                returned his bill [S. No. 33] entitled, "A bill to amend section 34
                                of an act to provide for the incorporation of railroad companies,"
                                approved May 11, 1852, with a recommendation that all the bill after
                                the 16th line thereon be stricken out, and insert in lieu thereof,
                                and when the bill is so amended, the committee recommend its
                                passage:
                            If any such corporation shall not within three years after its
                                incorporation begin the consruction of its road and expend thereon
                                five per centum of its capital and finish the same and put it in

                                charter shall become void, provided that the benefits of this
                                amendment shall toe extended to and employed only by such
                                corporation shall have expended for the construction of its road, at
                                least two hundred thousand dollars within ten years after its
                                incorporation and prior to the passage of this act.
                            SEC.-. There being an emergency existing for the immediate taking
                                effect of this act, the same shall be in force from and after its
                                passage.
                            The report was concurred in.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB. The bill as now amended was unanimously recommended by
                                the Judiciary Committee. The object is to save
                                the forfeiture of the charters of certain railroad companies where
                                they have expended as much as $200,000, for the purpose of getting
                                the bill before the other House.
                        
                        
                            WHAT COUNTIES ARE ARMED?
                            Mr. MELLETT. I move to reconsider the vote of Saturday adopting the
                                resolution requiring the Governor to report the number of arms
                                distributed in each county of the State. Upon consultation with
                                Senators * * * we thought it better to rescind the resolution.
                            Mr. FERGUSON. I think it proper that the resolution should be
                                reconsidered without stating why. I am satisfied of the propriety of
                                reconsidering the vote.
                            * * * * * * * * *
                            The motion to reconsider was agreed to.
                            Mr. ROBINSON asked and obtained leave to withdraw his resolution.
                        
                        
                            HOUSE BILLS ON THE SECOND READING.
                            The PRESIDENT. The Secretary will take up the orders of the day.
                            Mr. CONLEY. I move to take up Senate bills on their third
                                reading.
                            The PRESIDENT. We can not pass them if we do.
                            Mr. CONLEY. I think there is a quorum present.
                            VOICES"No, there ain't."
                            The PRESIDENT. I have counted, and there is not a quorum.
                            Mr. CONLEY. I withdraw the motion.
                            The Home Guard bill H. R. No. 37 [see page 116 of the BREVIER
                                LEGISLATIVE REPORTS] was read the second time and referred to the
                                    Military Committee.
                            The bill H. R. 41, amending the first section of the act prescribing
                                the duties of the State Auditor, approved May 2, 1852, was read the
                                second time and referred to the Judiciary
                                    Committee.
                            The incorporation of towns bill, H. R. 43, wag read the second time
                                and ordered to be engrossed for the third reading.
                            The bill H. R. 55, authorizing county commissioners to purchase State
                                bonds, was read the second time and referred to the
                                    Judiciary Committee.
                            The bill H. R. 48, amending
                                the valuation and appraisement law, was read the second time. Mr.
                                SHOEMAKER offered the following:
                            SEC.-. In making out tax duplicates hereafter it shall be the duty of
                                County Auditors to consolidate into one description as far as
                                practicable the description of all real property placed thereon; and
                                it is hereby made the duty of Boards of County Commissioners before
                                paying for the making out of such tax duplicate to see that the
                                provisions of this act are complied with.
                            The amendment was agreed to, and the bill referred to the
                                    Committee on Finance.
                        
                        
                            THE EXEMPTION LAW.
                            Mr. March's exemption bill, S. No 52, introduced Saturday, coming up
                                in regular order, it was read the second time.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON offered the following amendment:
                            SEC.-. Provided, however, That it shall be the duty
                                of Constables, Marshals and Sheriff's, in all cases where there is a
                                doubt as to the amount of property owned by the parties in execution
                                to value the same; and if it is found by such valuation that the
                                defendant in execution is the owner of a greater amount of property
                                in value than the plaintiff, then no exemption whatever shall be
                                allowed.
                            He said: This thing of exempting property is a question of doubtful
                                legality at any rate. With this amendment I would have no objections
                                to the bill.
                            Mr. MARCH. This is certainly a very adroit way of attacking and
                                defeating, under cover, a bill that I suppose the gentleman from
                                Putnam would not attack openly. But the says the bill is of doubtful
                                legality. Now Constitution prescribes that there shall be a
                                resonable amount of property exempt from execution and sale a
                                principle founded upon the most humane, wholesome and beneficent
                                provisions. It is intended as a guard against want, and the most
                                internal passions that sometimes reign in the human breast. How any
                                Senator, as humane as the Senator from Putnam, can make such a
                                proposition, I can not see. The proposition is that when the
                                creditor has more property than the debtor, then he shall not have
                                any benefit ot this law. Now the passage of this bill will affect
                                only contracts made after it becomes an act. It is fair, reasonable
                                and just. I have never seen, in my experience, and if any Senator
                                has I should like him to name it, any benefit to the public
                                generally, in having families sold out by constables or sheriffs. It
                                is always done by capitalists or traders, and only adds a little to
                                the large: accumulation in a few hands, strips the families of their
                                means of support, and makes them less  beneficial members of community. I do
                                not suppose the Senator is really serious in offering his amendment.
                                Unless some Senator wishes to remark upon it, I will move to lay it
                                on the table.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON. The Senator from Delaware is mistaken as to the object
                                of the amendment, us well as to the sincerity of the Senator from
                                Putnam. It is not made for the purpose of defeating, but perfecting
                                the bill. I think there is no justice in the world for a man owning
                                five hundred dollars worth of property to refuse to pay a man who
                                owns no property at all, which he could do under the provisions of
                                this bill. I do not object to exempting this amount of property, but
                                I do object to exempting a man with five hundred dollars when he
                                owes a man who does not own a cent, and I can not see why a
                                gentleman with the honesty of the gentleman from Delaware can object
                                to my amendment.
                            Mr. HAMILTON. I do not know but what I would like an amendment of
                                this kind: "Where the creditor is not worth as much as the debtor,
                                amend so as to make each equal." [Laughter.]
                            Mr. CONLEY. I move to lay the amendment of the gentleman from Allen
                                [Mr. Hamilton] on the table.
                            Mr. MARCH. I move to amend the amendment to the amendment, by
                                providing that if a person is worth more than $100,000 he shall
                                divide it amongst his neighbors.
                            A VOICE"Nary time."
                            Mr. HAMILTON withdrew his amendment to the amendment.
                            Mr STUDABAKER moved to lay the bill and pending amendment on the
                                table.
                            The yens and nays being demanded -
                            Mr. STUDABAKER withdrew his motion.
                            Mr. MARCH moved to lay the amendment on the table.
                            The yeas and nays being demanded -
                            Mr. MARCH withdrew his motion.
                            On motion of Mr. STUDABAKER, the bill and pending amendment were
                                referred to the Judiciary Committee.
                        
                        
                            ASSESSMENT FOR TAXATION.
                            On motion by Mr. SHOEMAKER, his bill, S. No. 46, introduced on Thursday,
                                was referred to the Committee on Finance.
                        
                        
                            THE TWO MILLION LOAN BILL.
                            The PRESIDENT. I introduced a bill a day or two since, diverting the
                                two cent tax levied last winter to provide for the payment of the
                                public debt of the State; and I also incorporated a provision
                                therein that any reimbursement of the war loan should be made
                                applicable to the redemption of the two million loan, lam instructed
                                by the Governor to lay before the Senate the following dispatches,
                                received by him from the Loan Commissioners in New York. I will also
                                say that the bill has been before the Committee on
                                    Finance, and will be ready for passage as soon as a
                                quorum appears.

                            Mr. MARCH'S bill, S. No. 55, introduced Saturday, coming up in order
                                was read the second, time.
                            Mr. MARCH offered the following amendment.
                            SEC. 2. That every non-commissioned officer, musician and private,
                                who shall be in the actual service of this State or of the United
                                States, for six or more consecutive months in one year, or more
                                years than one, shall be exempt from all poll-tax and capitation
                                read tax for the year during which such service, or the greater
                                portion thereof, is rendered. On proof of such service by
                                certificate of honorable discharge from the proper officers or other
                                satisfactory evidence, the township Trustee shall execute a
                                certificate thereof, which shall, on being presented to the
                                Supervisor, entitle him to exemption from such road tax. On like
                                proof the Auditor shall execute a certificate thereof, which shall,
                                when presented to the Treasurer, entitle him to such exemption.
                            SEC. 3. It is declared that an emergency exists for the immediate
                                taking effect of this act, it shall therefore take effect and be in
                                force from and after its passage.
                            The bill and pending amendment was referred to the Committee
                                    on Military Affairs.
                        
                        
                            THE PRACTICE ACT.
                            Mr. March's bill S. No. 54 was read the second time.
                            Mr. MARCH. That bill passed the Senate last session. I trust it will
                                pass to a third reading.
                            The PRESIDENT. The bill will be engrossed for a third reading
                                tomorrow.
                        
                        
                            THE STATE LIBRARY.
                            Mr. March's bill S. No. 53,
                                was read the second time and ordered to be engrossed for the third
                                reading.
                        
                        
                            THE NORTHERN PRISON.
                            The bill H. R. No. 56 (described in the House proceedings of
                                Saturday) was read the first time and passed to the second
                                reading.
                        
                        
                            NO QUORUM.
                            The PRESIDENT announced the files as being clear.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS moved to adjourn but immediately withdrew his motion for
                                -
                            Mr. STUDABAKER. Mr. President: I have counted and think there is a
                                quorum in the city, I move that there be a call of the House, that
                                it may be understood when there is a quorum in the city it is to be
                                here.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            The Secretary called the roll and reported twenty-eight members
                                present.
                            Mr. CARNAHAN moved that the absentees be sent for.
                            A list was given to the Door-keeper -
                            And then came the recess till two o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            On motion of Mr. CONNER, further proceed  ings under the call, pending at the
                                recess for dinner, were dispensed with.


                            
                                THE STATE OF THE UNION.
                                The PRESIDENT announced the special order for this hour, being
                                    the joint resolution H. R. 7 - printed on pages 119 and 120 of
                                    these Reports - instructing Indiana Congressmen with reference
                                    to the national crisis.
                                Mr. RAY offered the following amendment:
                                Amend by adding to the first resolution these words, viz.:"And to
                                    blockade effectually all southern seaports against the world;
                                    and with the distinct understanding that the war shall be
                                    prosecuted only for the purpose of crushing out rebellion,
                                    restoring the Union, maintaining the Constitution, enforcing the
                                    laws and securing American liberty; and not for any sectional,
                                    political, or anti-slavery purpose."
                                Amend further by striking out whenever they Occur the words,
                                    "Congressmen" and "member of Congress," and inserting
                                    "Representatives in Congress."
                                Mr. MURRAY moved to amend the amendment by striking out all after
                                    the word "liberty."
                                Mr. MURRAY. Mr. President. It seems to me, Sir, that amendment
                                    would imply an intention, upon the part of the General
                                    Government, in the war now being prosecuted against these
                                    rebels, to abolish or interfere with the peculiar institutions
                                    of the South. It is casting an imputation upon the
                                    Administration, and the Union men rallying around that
                                    administration, in the prosecution of this war, and I would be
                                    unwilling to vote for the amendment with that imputation in it.
                                    It is uncalled for, and will have a mischievous effect. We don't
                                    want to connect this matter with politics.
                                Mr. RAY. That is what we want to have disavowed.
                                Mr. MILLER. I am opposed to the amendment of the gentleman from
                                    Shelby, [Mr. Ray] believing that, the resolution is complete
                                    within itself. It declares that these Senators and
                                    Representatives in Congress are requested to vote all needful
                                    aid in men and money that the General Government may require to
                                    suppress this rebellion. The Senator from Shelby adds a blockade
                                    of all the Southern ports against the wold. I apprehend that the
                                    purpose of blockading any of the Southern ports is to aid in the
                                    suppression of this rebellion. As has been remarked by the
                                    Senator from Elkhart, the language of the amendment implies that
                                    the General Government may be prosecuting this war for
                                    anti-slavery purposes. Now, I do not suppose the administration
                                    desires to carry on the war for any such purpose, and I am
                                    unwilling to pass a resolution which implies any such thing.
                                Mr. STUDABAKER. I apprehend there is no very material difference
                                    in this Senate as to the substance of these resolutions. As far
                                    as the language of the resolutions are concerned, my own opinion
                                    is, to prevent any discussion upon them, they had better be
                                    referred to the Committee on Federal
                                        Relations, and I think that committee can so shape
                                    them as that they will express the sense of the Senate. It might
                                    serve a purpose to make a denial of anti-slavery object in this
                                    struggle, for it is not to be denied that, in the States which
                                    are not in open rebellion, the idea is that the war is being
                                    carried on for that purpose; and if that idea were negatived, it
                                    might do aa much good as millions of dollars and thousands of
                                    men.
                                Mr. RAY. I trust the resolutions will not be referred. I propose
                                    merely to add an explanatory clause to the first resolution,
                                    which is very simple, and every Senator can see what it is. The
                                    amendment does not complicate it any. It is objected that this
                                    amendment is intended to imply that the war is carried on for
                                    the purpose of subduing or suppressing slavery. Just the
                                    contrary is the case. The weapon that is in the hands of the
                                    secessionists, and that they operate upon the fears and passions
                                    of the people with, is that this is an unholy war, without
                                    justification, without warrant in the Federal Constitution, and
                                    against their constitutional rights, for the purpose of wiping
                                    out the institution of slavery. I have no doubt Congress will
                                    declare the objects of the war, or the President will by
                                    proclamation if Congress does not. By no means do we want our
                                    Representatives in Congress to vote means and money to carry on
                                    a war outside of the Federal Constitution. The object is not to
                                    avenge old insults, to impair the rights of the South in negro
                                    slaves, to extirpate them, burn their cities, or anything of
                                    that kind, but simply to put down rebellion, disavowing any
                                    unconstitutional or improper purposes. I think it highly proper
                                    this explanatory amendment shall accompany these
                                    resolutions.
                                Mr. MARCH. I regret the introduction of this amendment, not that
                                    I have any objection to it. but because it is calculated to stir
                                    up a little of the old fire of party. I think the resolutions
                                    express the sentiment of a determined people, having a
                                    government worth standing by, and there is no necessity of
                                    amending them by saying that somebody has some unconstitutional
                                    design. Gentlemen say nobody has it, but the amendment contains
                                    upon its face an insinuation that we have. I deny it. I regret
                                    we have a war, for it makes me feel that we have not advanced to
                                    that stage of Christianity that we fondly dreamed we had. But,
                                    sir, there are benefits to be derived from it, and 1 trust one
                                    of them is that we are to get rid of this hair-splitting
                                    platform principle. We are out upon an unknown field. I do not
                                    suppose any body dreams of carrying on this war to effect
                                    slavery, but it may effect it. We simply want to go into this
                                    contest for the preservation of the Union and the
                                    Constitution.
                                Mr. RAY, (interposing.) Then the amendment will fully express the
                                    desire of the Senator.
                                Mr. MARCH. But it is totalogy, for the  original resolution covers the
                                    whole ground with the exception of the negative. I would prefer
                                    voting for the original resolution as it came from the House,
                                    and I have no objection to voting for the amendment as suggested
                                    by the gentleman from Elkhart, [Mr. Murray,] or I would have no
                                    objections to a reference to a committee.
                                Mr. MELLETT. I cannot support the amendment, by any means; and I
                                    think the gentleman from Shelby ought to have added, to make it
                                    perfect, that our members of Congress ought not to pass any
                                    unconstitutional act as a general principle. There are no
                                    persons in Indiana so dumb as not to know that the emancipation
                                    of slaves is not the object of this war. This thing, in my
                                    judgment, with all due respect to the Senator, is becoming
                                    absolutely ridiculous. If this Legislature were to pass such a
                                    resolution, it would show a want of self-respect, in us. We did
                                    not precipitate this war - we are acting on the defensive.
                                Mr. NEWCOMB. I regret that this amendment has been thrown in here
                                    to provoke discussion. I do not know how often I have voted upon
                                    this floor for just such sentiments, and I confess I have got
                                    very nearly tired of it, for I have never seen any beneficial
                                    effects so far. I would be willing, however, again to go with
                                    the gentleman from Shelby, and declare, by a solemn legislative
                                    act, that, in this lamentable state of affairs, we have no such
                                    intention as is intimated, though I expect it would have as
                                    little influence as the twittering of a jay bird. These people
                                    have lived along side of us long enough to know it. The men on
                                    the border who are secessionists are in favor of secession
                                    because they are disunionists per se - they
                                    want to be by themselves - cut loose from the money-loving
                                    North, that they may build up a grand government for themselves.
                                    It is not that the Northern people are disposed to liberate
                                    their slaves. They don't believe a word of it. But since they
                                    have seen the hordes of the North almost as large as the army of
                                    Xerxes or of Napoleon the Great, they have learned to dream
                                    different, dreams from those they have been indulging in
                                    heretofore; and I would not to day, in order to stop the war,
                                    vote for any proposition that would make Jeff. Davis's followers
                                    lay down their arms, for we can crush them out in a way that
                                    will deter future generations from following in their course. I
                                    would rather pass no resolutions at all than to have this
                                    amendment added to them. Then there is nothing in the history of
                                    this unfortunate war to justify the innuendo that the
                                    Administration has any such intention. The President of the
                                    United States, when he called out these forces, expressly
                                    disclaimed any such intention just as plainly as words could
                                    intimate without saying "slave" or ''slavery." Are we then to
                                    pass a resolution here that, by implication, calls into question
                                    his veracity, integrity and honesty? For that reason alone I
                                    would be compelled to vote against this amendment. We have seen
                                    how the proclamation of the President has been adhered to by our
                                    military commanders. When Gen. Butler entered Annapolis with his
                                    forces, at a time when the blood of our murdered soldiers yet
                                    stained the pavements of Baltimore, and all Maryland seemed to
                                    be rising in insurrection against the Government, this able
                                    commander, overlooking the outrages perpetrated on the soldiers
                                    of Massachusetts, promptly tendered the service of his command
                                    to suppress a reported servile insurrection in the State of
                                    Maryland; and, more than that, sent back to their masters runaway slaves who came to him for protection.
                                    It is true, as has been remarked, that his action was called in
                                    question by the Executive of Massachusetts, but his response to
                                    Governor Andrew, manly, candid and patriotic as it was, must
                                    have convinced Governor Andrew, as it did the great mass of the
                                    Northern people, of the wisdom of his course. Again sir: from
                                    Fortress Monroe fugitive slaves have been returned to their
                                    masters, who were traitors to and enemies of the Government,
                                    thus scrupulous to avoid giving offense in this particular. We
                                    have been informed, also, that the beleagured garrison of Fort
                                    Pickens refused shelter and protection to runaway slaves from
                                    the traitor masters of Florida, this, too, at a time when the
                                    meager garrison were overworked and wearied out with the labor
                                    necessary to protect themselves from the hostility of the owners
                                    of those negroes, and when the voluntary labor of the latter
                                    would have been a welcome relief to this handful of brave men
                                    who were upholding the flag and honor of the country on its far
                                    Southern boundary. I believe we have carried this delicacy to an
                                    excess. I believe that henceforth the administration would be
                                    justified in receiving all slaves who flock to its armies and
                                    set them to digging entrenchments and doing the hard work which
                                    must, otherwise be performed by our white soldiers. The Chivalry
                                    have pressed into their service the persecuted free blacks of
                                    the South, to do this kind of work for them, and I would use the
                                    willing labor of the fugitive bondman to save the health and
                                    strength of the patriotic soldiers of the Republic. This is a
                                    very different thing to abolishing slavery by force of arms, and
                                    is justifiable by the laws of war; and, permit me to add, it is
                                    a very different thing from inaugurating a servile insurrection.
                                    The facts I have stated show the injustice of the innuendo
                                    container in the proposed amendment. But I have a stronger
                                    objection to the amendment. The joint resolutions propose to
                                    instruct our Senators to vote men and money for the prosecution
                                    of the war into which we have been forced in defense of the
                                    Constitution. The proposed amendment would furnish a plausible
                                    excuse or pretext to a Senator to vote against all supplies, as
                                    he would only have to say that, in his judgment, such supplies
                                    were to be used to further sectional or anti-slavery purposes.
                                         I do not intimate that
                                    either of our Senators will need instructions, but, if the
                                    instructions are proper and necessary, the amendment would
                                    nullify them. For the reasons I have given, Mr. President, I am
                                    opposed to the 'amendment offered by the Senator from Shel-by,
                                    and I trust that it will not be adopted.
                                Mr. WOLFE. It seems that every gentleman who has spoken in
                                    opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from
                                    Shelby, [Mr. Ray,] says the amendment expenses his own feelings,
                                    but put their objections on the ground that it is an act of
                                    super-errogation for them, or the people of Indiana, to express
                                    such a sentiment on the record. That is a queer position for
                                    gentlemen to occupy. What kind of opposition could I make
                                    against the resolutions themselves on such grounds? Were I to
                                    say, "why there is nobody in Indiana who objects to them." That
                                    certainly would not be a good reason to vote against them. "We
                                    wish simply to instruct our Representatives in Congress," say
                                    gentlemen. Well, I venture the prediction, there is not a member
                                    of Congress from Indiana that will not do just what the
                                    resolutions require ; but shall I therefore vote against them?
                                    The same kind of argument used against the amendment, if carried
                                    out, would operate equally against the resolutions. Gentlemen
                                    say, the present is the time for the North to offer compromises;
                                    this may be; but that is not the question. This war will never
                                    succeed in putting down the rebellion in the South, unless it is
                                    done partially by the Union loving men of the South. To do this
                                    it is of the greatest importance that they are informed as to
                                    the real intentions of the government in the prosecution of the
                                    war. This information the amendment proposes to give them. There
                                    is a noble band of Union men in portions of the South. For
                                    instance, in eastern Tennessee, headed by the heroic and
                                    immortal Andrew Johnson. I can see, in imagination, that bold
                                    patriot making a speech to two or three thousand people, one
                                    fourth of whom are probably Secessionists. Indiana, by her
                                    Senate, stands on the witness stand to testify that it is not
                                    the intention of the Government to crush out slavery, or in any
                                    way to interfere with the institutions of the South, and by a
                                    resolution that testimony would be of great value to the
                                    Union-loving men of the South. As a matter of policy, to enable
                                    the South to get a verdict at the ballot box. Yet gentlemen say
                                    they wont testify they stand dumb. I cannot see any objection to
                                    adopting this amendment and putting ourselves right on the
                                    record.
                                Mr. DeHART would not oppose the motion to refer, but would oppose
                                    the adoption of the amendment.
                                Mr. BLACK opposed the motion to refer the resolutions to a
                                    committee, and urged a vote at once.
                                Mr. STUDABAKER demanded the previous question on his motion to
                                    refer. - The demand was seconded, and the vote taken - yeas 32,
                                    nays 11.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                            
                            
                                HOME GUARDS.
                                Mr. WOLFE, from the Committee on Military
                                        Affairs, returned the bill H. R. 37, recommending
                                    the substitution therefor of his independent military bill S.
                                    No. 1.
                                On motion by Mr. CRAVEN'S (Mr. Tarkington in the Chair) it was
                                    made the special order for to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock.
                                Mr. CRAVENS. We have now been here nearly forty days, and I say
                                    boldly, and in my place, that this Legislature has done
                                    everything that the country could have requited of it. In the
                                    first two weeks we appropriated $100,000 to the Governor's
                                    contingent fund; agreed to loan $2,000,000, and dispatched
                                    commissioners to the Eastern cities for the purpose of
                                    negotiating the loan. We also appropriated $500,000 for the
                                    purpose of arming the State; but I say to you, though the people
                                    of Indiana have responded with the same alacrity, the State of
                                    Indiana i to-day is as utterly defenceless as though these
                                    appropriations had not been made. In addition, we passed a
                                    resolution authorizing the Government to put into the hands of
                                    the border counties five thousand stand of arms, and without
                                    knowing whether that resolution had been complied with this
                                    Senate passed a resolution calling for information from the
                                    Executive upon that point. Today a motion was made to reconsider
                                    that vote, and a reason given therefor, sustaining the position
                                    I have taken. What was it? it was that we should not expose our
                                    defenceless position upon the border by this report. And for
                                    that reason, inasmuch as we have passed a militia law, and in
                                    consideration of the fact that there has been mustered into the
                                    service of the United States, four out of the six regiments
                                    which we called out for the protection of property and citizens
                                    of the State. I am warranted in saying that the State is utterly
                                    and entirely defenceless. For that reason I propose to offer the
                                    following joint resolutions.
                            
                            
                                CAVALRY.
                                Mr CRAVEN'S introduced a joint resolution [S. No. 7,] requesting
                                    the Governor to call into active service, and to arm
                                    effectually, eight companies of cavalry, and to organize the
                                    same as a regiment under the militia law, in accordance with
                                    sections 29, 32 and 33 of an act approved May 11th, 1861,
                                    entitled "An act for the organization and regulation of the
                                    Indiana Militia," &c.
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Be it resolved by the General Assembly
                                                  of the State of Indiana, That the Governor be
                                                and he is hereby requested immediately to call into
                                                the service of the State eight companies of cavalry,
                                                to be organized in the first, second, third and
                                                fourth Congressional Districts, to be located along
                                                the entire southern line of the State, not, far from
                                                the Ohio river, at the distance of from thirty to
                                                thirty-five miles apart from each other, so as to
                                                communicate with each other daily; to be organ-  ized as a

                                                of men of good character and loyal to the State and
                                                the United States, who will forthwith organize under
                                                the militia law, and who will furnish their own
                                                horses and horse equipments, as provided in the
                                                United States regulations on that subject, embraced
                                                in General Orders No. 15, under date May 4th, 1861.
                                                And provided that nothing in this joint resolution
                                                shall be construed so as to prevent the retiring
                                                from active service of the whole or a part of said
                                                companies in case of the conclusion of peace or the
                                                disappearance of danger along the border; or as
                                                authorizing half-pay or any other compensation
                                                whatever to the members of said companies in case of
                                                such retirement from active service.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. CRAVENS. I claim no credit for the origination of that
                                    resolution, but I heartily endorse every sentiment it contains,
                                    and I will say that this furnishes, to my mind, the most
                                    efficient and decided protection the people of Indiana can have
                                    for the same amount of money. We are without an army, without
                                    anything for protection. We have not, upon our border, a single
                                    sentinel by State authority, and it is well known to gentlemen
                                    that part of the State is the advance guard, and the question
                                    is, shall we give them anything to protect themselves and the
                                    State with? The object of this whole organization is simple.
                                    This regiment can be divided into eight companies and can be in
                                    daily communication, and thus afford complete protection, and
                                    information can be communicated to all parts of the State of any
                                    intended attack.
                                Mr. MURRAY I understand that four regiments have been already
                                    mustered into the United States service, and that an additional
                                    regiment, will also be mustered.
                                Mr. SLACK. There are four regiments, of the six raised for State
                                    purposes, turned over to the United States. We passed a law
                                    authorizing the raising of six regiments for State purposes, and
                                    gave the Governor discretion to organize one of the six into
                                    cavalry. Now what is the reason he cannot, under that law, yet
                                    authorize a regiment of cavalry?
                                Mr. CRAVENS. The reason is, he has not done it.
                                Mr. CLAYPOOL could not vote upon the resolution, from the fact
                                    that he was wholly ignorant as to how many of the six regiments
                                    mustered into the State service have been turned over into the
                                    United States service, &c. H is due to the Senate to know
                                    how these matters are, and that information should be had by
                                    to-morrow morning at farthest.
                                Mr. DeHART stated that it was the general impression that this
                                    Legislature had not gone far enough in its preparations for
                                    defense. It has been the wonder of military men, time and again,
                                    iluit we have not adopted cavalry as a means of defense. This
                                    resolution is a simple request of the Governor to call into
                                    service these men. He wants the advice of the Legislature, and
                                    we can give it to him in no belter way than by resolution.
                                Mr. STEELE. If cavalry is best adapted to their interests, let us
                                    vote it; but so far as he had read of military operations,
                                    cavalry has been used but to bring on engagements, and break the
                                    lines of the enemy in time of war.
                                Mr. CLAYPOOL supposed the southern border was armed. We are not
                                    so weak as some gentlemen imagined; and the government of the
                                    United States is amply equal to the emergency.
                                Mr. President CRAVENS. The government is not looking to these
                                    local points, and we must attend to that ourselves. If it is the
                                    will of the Senate to defer it till tomorrow he was willing to
                                    let the resolution be passed over informally
                                Mr. WILLIAMS moved to amend the joint resolution by striking out
                                    all after the resolving clause, and inserting the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved by the General Assembly of the
                                                  State of Indiana, That the Governor be
                                                requested to organize the Sixth Regiment ot State
                                                troops into cavalry and artillery, provided the
                                                volunteers offering to serve, will furnish their own
                                                nurses.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. MURRAY understood the six regiments were raised especially to
                                    defend the State, and now it seems the Governor has turned over
                                    four of the six to the United States service. A resolution had
                                    better be passed, authorizing the Governor to send these two
                                    remaining regiments to the border, rather than keep them up here
                                    at an enormous expense, where they are of no practical use. Two
                                    regiments on the border, properly drilled, are sufficient. All
                                    that can be feared there are cut-throats who come over under
                                    cover of the darkness of night to rob and plunder. He thought we
                                    should have information from the Governor concerning this
                                    matter. - The resolution was passed over informally by
                                    consent.
                                Mr. CLAYPOOL offered the following, which was adopted:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Governor be, and
                                                he is hereby requested to inform the Senate at as
                                                early a day as practicable, how many regiments have
                                                been organized under the act for organizing six
                                                regiments for State service, and whether those
                                                regiments are composed of infantry, cavalry or
                                                artillery, and whether he has turned over to the
                                                United States any portion of said regiments. If so,
                                                what number, and what portion of said six regiments
                                                are, or will be under State pay after filling up the
                                                four regiments asked for by the United States, and
                                                of what will, they be composed, infantry, cavalry or
                                                artillery; and whether it is the  design to organize any
                                                cavalry or artillery under said six regiment bill.
                                                If so, what amount of cavalry, and what amount of
                                                artillery, and whether any portion will be flying

                                Mr. STUDABAKER, from the Judiciary Committee,
                                    returned the bill H. R. 38 - see pages 116 and 117 of these
                                    Reports - recommending passage, with an amendment, striking out
                                    the words "interfere with the management and disbursement of the
                                    various trust funds belonging to or held by this State,
                                    according to the laws regulating the same" and inserting in lieu
                                    thereof the following words ; "Prevent the receiving or paying
                                    out or loaning of the treasury, any of the trust funds held by
                                    the State, or belonging to the State, as may have been required
                                    by law at the date of the passage of said act."
                                The report was concurred in.

                                Mr. MILLER, by consent, offered the following joint resolution,
                                    [S. 87]:

                                            Be it Resolved by the General Assembly
                                                  of the State of Indiana, That the
                                                Superintendent of Public Instruction is hereby
                                                authorized and instructed to make the first
                                                apportionment of the school revenue for the year
                                                1861. to the several counties of the State without
                                                reference to the diminution of $100 authorized in
                                                certain cases by section 117 of an act entitled "an

                                                1861.
                                            And that all counties and County Auditors are hereby
                                                relieved and exempted from the penalties prescribed
                                                in said section 117, which may have been incurred by
                                                reason of the failure of any County Auditor to make
                                                the semiannual report required on the 3d Monday of
                                                April, 1861, by section 185 of said act.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. MILLER. There are twenty-five county auditors failing to make
                                    their report in time, and under the school law these counties
                                    are subjected to a diminution of $100 for the failure. This
                                    resolution relieves them from that penalty, and is introduced at
                                    the suggestion of the Superintendent of Public Instruction.
                                Mr. LINE was afraid this resolution would be establishing a
                                    precedent that would hereafter be taken ad vantage of by all
                                    defaulting officers; and should consequently vote against
                                    it.
                                The resolution failed for want of a constitutional majority, by
                                    yeas 22, nays 15.
                                On motion by Mr. SLACK, a recount of this vote was had, and
                                    resulted yeas 24, nays 13,

                                Mr. DeHart's bill, S No. 41, introduced Thursday, coming upon regular order,
                                    was read the, third time, and passed the last reading in the
                                    Senate by yeas 35, nays 0.

                                Mr. Cravens' bill, S. 47,
                                    introduced Friday, coming up, was read and passed the first
                                    reading! in the Senate by yeas 32, nays 2.

                                Mr. Cobb's bill, S. No. 42, [providing for service of process on
                                    railroad companies when their office is out of the State, giving
                                    fifteen instead of thirty days notice,] was read the third time,
                                    and finally passed by yeas 34, nays 2.
                            
                            
                                THE SALARY BILL.
                                Mr. March's bill, S. No. 43, was read the third time.
                                Mr. MARCH. This bill was passed at the last session. Its simple
                                    object is to ascertain the fees of county officers for the
                                    purpose of obtaining a basis for the equalization of their
                                    salaries by some future Legislature.
                                The bill finally passed by yeas 30, nays 5.
                                And then the Senate adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            MONDAY, May 27, 1861.
                        
                        The House met at 9 o'clock a. m.
                        On motion of Mr. HAYES, the reading of the journal of yesterday was
                            dispensed with.
                        
                            CORRECTION.
                            Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of personal privilege.
                                In the reports of the Sentinel on Saturday, they
                                make me to have said, after the report of Mr. McLean relative to the
                                salaries of the officers of the Northern State Prison, that the
                                board only met once in three months, and that alternately by its
                                members. This gave a very wrong impression. I stated that the board
                                held regular sessions once a month, and alternately members visiting
                                the prison singly, once in two weeks, and perhaps oftener. Again, in
                                reply to a question asked by Mr. McLean, this paper reports me as
                                saying that our prison moral instructor was well qualified for a
                                stud-horse keeper. [Laughter.] I made no such remark. My reply was,
                                that, if the gentleman desired to know his qualifications as a stud
                                horse keeper, I might be able to give him some information. The
                                reporter might have inferred that I was better qualified to decide
                                of his qualifications as a stud-horse keeper than as a moral
                                instructor.
                        
                        
                            ADJOURNMENT SINE DIE.
                            Mr. FLEMING submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That this House do adjourn
                                                sine die (the Senate concurring
                                            therein) on Friday the 31st inst.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. EDSON desired to lay it on the table.
                            Mr. NEBEKER would prefer to adopt the resolution, because we could
                                not get up" the specific appropriation bill till the day of
                                adjournment should be fixed.
                            Mr. PROSSER. I move to amend by saying "Sunday, June second."
                            Mr. ORR. I do not think that is necessary, because the Constitution
                                adjourns us that day.
                            Mr. ROBBINS proposed a substitute, as follows:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That this House will (the
                                            Senate concurring) adjourn sine die
                                            Tuesday, the 28th of May, 1861.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. FISHER. I have no doubt, that, in order to complete the business
                                of the two Houses, it will require the whole time of this week.
                                There are important bills to be disposed of. The specific
                                appropriation bill, as the gentleman from  Warren, [Mr. Nebeker] has suggested,
                                cannot be completed until the day of adjournment shall be
                                determined. I feel that it is a very important matter in the passage
                                of these appropriation bills, that we should have time to consider
                                them. If we are forced into a passage of these in a hurry, great
                                injustice is liable to be done. I think myself that it will require
                                all of this week to get through as we ought. Certainly we can't
                                adjourn on Tuesday; for if we were to do so, we could not
                                constitutionally send another bill to the governor. If we adjourn on
                                Saturday, all the bills must go into his hands on Thursday; and I do
                                not think we can get them into his hands earlier than Thursday. I
                                suppose we shall adjourn on Saturday; and if we fix that day, we can
                                then go to work and complete the specific appropriation bill at
                                once.
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair supposes that if we continue in session till
                                the expiration of the constitutional term, there is really no need
                                of a resolution.
                            Mr. BLACK submitted the following by way of substitute:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the House will not
                                            adjourn while there is a red in the Treasury.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. PROSSER. I should like to know what is meant there by "red?"
                            The SPEAKER. It probably means "redeye."
                            On motion by Mr. PROSSER, the resolution and proposed amendment were
                                laid on the table.
                            Mr. FISHER. Mr. Speaker, I move to reconsider that vote, if it is
                                understood by it that we are to include Sunday. I wish to fix
                                Saturday.
                            Mr. EDSON. I move to lay the motion to reconsider on the table.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            LOAN BILL.
                            Mr. GRAIN, from the Committee on Ways and Means,
                                returned Mr. Veatch's loan bill [7] with a recommendation that it be
                                laid on the table. He stated that this was one of the bond bills
                                introduced in the early part of the session that the other one was
                                passed superceding this.
                            The report was concurred in, and the bill laid on the table
                                accordingly.
                        
                        
                            APPORTIONMENT.
                            Mr. LANE made an ineffectual effort to take up Mr. Holcomb's
                                resolution for a special committee of one from each Congressional
                                district to consider and report on the apportionment of the State
                                for Senatorial and Representative purposes.
                        
                        
                            WORK FOR COMMITTEES.
                            On motion by Mr. BLACK, his county clerk bill, [49] was considered on
                                the second reading, and referred to the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary.
                            On motion by Mr. ANDERSON, his highway bill, [57] was taken up and
                                referred to the Committee on Roads and Highways.
                                On motion by Mr. THOMAS, his liquor bill, [50] was taken up and
                                referred to the Committee Military Affairs.
                            Mr. Veatch's supplementary militia bill, [52] was considered, and
                                referred to the Committee on Military
                                Affairs.
                            Mr. Bundy's treasurer's fee bill, [54] was considered, and referred
                                to the Committee on the Judiciary.
                        
                        
                            REVIVAL OF RAILROAD CHARTERS - THE INDIANA AND
                                ILLINOIS RAILROAD.
                            On motion by Mr. LANE, his railroad bill, [73] was taken up, and
                                considered on the second reading.
                            Mr. UNDERWOOD proposed to amend by striking out the words: "four
                                hundred dollars."
                            Mr. LANE. If that amendment goes to the committee, being imperative,
                                it would kill the bill. In drawing that bill, we have guarded it so
                                that it can not affect any other road than the one designed to be
                                affected by it. We do not design to injure the prospects of any
                                road. But if the $400,000 were stricken out, the bill, if it passed,
                                would revive every railroad charter in the State, Therefore I move
                                to lay the amendment on the table. - The motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. MOORMAN proposed to amend, by striking out "$400,000," and
                                inserting "$200,-000."
                            Mr. DOBBINS proposed to amend, by inserting appropriately the words,
                                "inquire into the expediency of," and direct it to the
                                    Committee on Corporations.
                            Mr. MOORMAN. I made that motion, Mr. Speaker, because I desire the
                                amendment. I am not asking as to the expediency of the motion. I
                                have decided that for myself. I desire to submit the amendment
                                distinctly to the House, and let its expediency be decided by the
                                House.
                            Mr. DOBBINS. If the amendment would affect other roads, I shall be
                                opposed to it.
                            Mr. MOORMAN. It will revive all railroad charters where the company
                                have expended $200,000.
                            Mr. FERGUSON. It seems a little hard to suit every gentleman. This
                                bill, if passed in the shape in which the amendment proposes to put
                                it, would certainly work very injuriously in the section of the
                                country where I live. The Evansville and Indianapolis Air Line
                                Railroad Company have about fifty miles graded. Perhaps $400,000
                                would be greater than the amount they have expended, but $200,000
                                would embrace them. Therefore I move to lay the amendment on the
                                table.
                            The motion was agreed to, and the bill was referred to the
                                    Committee on Corporations.
                        
                        
                            THE MILITIA LAW SANCTION.
                            Mr. Warrum's military tax bill [47] coming up in order on the second
                                reading -
                            Mr. WOODHULL moved that it be referred to the Committee on
                                    Military Affairs.
                            Mr. DAVIS moved to indefinitely postpone the bill.
                            Mr. NEBEKER hoped it would be referred was not prepared to vote
                                finally on this bill now.
                            Mr. DAVIS. It was evident, from the number of volunteers we have, and
                                the readiness with which men everywhere enter the service, that we
                                have no need of this bill, and the people will not approve it. It
                                compels every man to muster, or pay a fine - and a dollar a month at
                                that.
                            Mr. ROBBINS could not see the advantage of the militia law, without a
                                penalty to enforce it. He would prefer the tax to be fixed at one or
                                two dollars a year, and for
                                that purpose would have it referred to the Committee on
                                    Military Affairs.
                            Mr. FERGUSON. It was strange that gentlemen wanted compulsory
                                measures, when the State was overrun with volunteers eager tor
                                military service, and entirely sufficient to keep up the military
                                spirit of the people.
                            Mr. CRAIN. The people were taxed enough. Militia drill was worth
                                nothing, except in companies, where they take a pride in it,
                                &c.
                            Mr. ORR would rather see the bill laid on the table. The author of it
                                was not in his place.
                            The bill was referred (by unanimous consent) to the
                                    Committee on Military Affairs.
                            Mr. HAYES proposed to" amend the bill, by Striking out the words,
                                "one dollar for every day he should have mustered," and inserting
                                these words, "two dollars per year."
                            The amendment was also referred to the Committee on Military
                                    Affairs.
                            Mr. Jenkinson's swinging bridge bill [45] was considered on the
                                second reading, and laid on the table.
                            The official garnishment bill [S. 25] coming up -
                            Mr. BLACK proposed to amend by inserting in the proper place the
                                words, "and attorneys."
                            On motion by Mr. FISHER, the bill and amendment were referred to the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary.
                            The street railroad bill [S. 28] was referred to to the Committee
                                    on Corporations.
                            Mr. KENDRICK considered that the City Councils should have control of
                                such matters.
                            Mr FISHER stated that this bill was suggested by the city officers of
                                Indianapolis.
                            On motion by Mr. EDSON, Mr. Dobbins had leave of absence for the day,
                                on account of sickness.
                        
                        
                            EXPENSE OF THE SESSION.
                            The SPEAKER read a communication from the Auditor of State, stating
                                that the appropriation of $15,000 for the expenses of the present
                                session of the General Assembly had been exhausted to within
                                $200.
                            SEVERAL VOICES: " I want a warrant." [Laughter]
                            On motion of Mr. WOODHULL, it was referred to the Committee
                                    on Ways and Means.
                        
                        
                            PERRY COUNTY BUILDING AT ROME.
                            The old county seat seminary bill [S. 27] was considered and
                                referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
                        
                        
                            COUNTY AUDITORS' EDUCATIONAL REPORTS.
                            Mr. FISHER submitted the following:
                            WHEREAS by the school law passed at the regular session, it became
                                the duty of the County Auditors to make a report to the
                                Superintendent of Public Instruction on or before the third Monday
                                of April in each year, under a penalty of one hundred dollars.
                            And WHEREAS, it is believed that it is wholly impracticable for many
                                of the Auditors to make out their delinquent list, and make accurate
                                returns by the time directed. Therefore -
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Be it Resolved, That the
                                                Committee on Education be
                                            instructed to inquire into the expediency of amending
                                            said law and report by bill or otherwise.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr FISHER. I introduced that resolution at the suggestion of the
                                Clerk of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. He says that many
                                of the County Auditors have insisted that it is impossible for them
                                to make their reports by the third Monday in March - that is, it
                                will be impossible for them to make accurate returns. Some
                                twenty-five of them made no returns at all till after the first of
                                April the time prescribed in the school law. This accounts for the
                                delay in the distribution of the school money. The Clerk assures rne
                                that the time between receiving the taxes, and the time the County
                                Auditors are required to report, is too short for them, with any
                                reasonable force in their offices, to make out their reports. I
                                have, therefore, introduced this resolution.
                            The resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            STATE CENCUS OF VOTERS.
                            Mr. STEVENSON submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Judiciary
                                                Committee be instructed to inquire into
                                            the expediency of authorizing an enumeration of the
                                            white male citizens of the State of Indiana over
                                            twenty-one years of age; and that they report by bill or
                                            otherwise.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The House then took a recess till 2 o'clock P.M.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The SPEAKER laid before the House the following communication from
                                the Commissary General.
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            INDIANAPOLIS, May 27, 1881.
                                        
                                        
                                            To the Speaker of the House of
                                                Representatives:
                                        
                                        Having learned that the honorable body over which you
                                            have the honor to preside passed, late on Saturday
                                            evening, a resolution condemnatory of the actions of
                                            your Commissary General, charging him with malfeasance
                                            in office and incompetency; he therefore begs leave to
                                            present to your honorable body a few remarks for their
                                            consideration.
                                        1st. He understands that one particular cause of
                                            complaint arises from the fact that he purchased for the
                                            use of the troops coffee which had previously been
                                            roasted, adulterated, and ground. In explanation of the
                                            same he begs leave to state that in consequence of the
                                            great rush of volunteers here, both night and day, who
                                            came with no camp equipages, or cooking utensils, and
                                            the Quartermaster General not being able to provide or
                                            furnish the same, your Commissary was, and is now,
                                            unable to see any other plan by which coffee in such
                                            large amounts could have been issued to them, as they
                                            had no means of preparing green coffee for use. The
                                            issues of ground coffee were made by consultation with
                                            your former Quartermaster General, and were only
                                            continued until the proper utensils could be provided
                                            for cooking; since which time I have continued to issue
                                            green coffee, and, in many instances, with less
                                            satisfaction to the troops.
                                        2d. Another cause of complaint he understands to arise
                                            from the fact that he purchased, for the use of the
                                            troops, pork in which he held a half interest. Your
                                            Commissary is at a loss to determine how it would affect
                                            the  State's
                                            interest, or that of the troops, provided it was a good
                                            article, and purchased at as low a price as it could
                                            have been from other holders.
                                        When a prohibition was placed on all kinds shipments to
                                            the South, there was a very sudden and large decline in
                                            the article of pork in Cincinnati, and in consequence
                                            thereof. your Commissary, in consultation with your
                                            Inspector-General, Miles Murphy, placed an agent in that
                                            market (Cincinnati.) through whom our orders have since
                                            been filled. in this connection I would also remark that
                                            there have been charges of unsound and unwholesome pork
                                            having been issued to the troops. But one instance of
                                            this kind has been brought to my knowledge, and that was
                                            immediately corrected by giving good meat in return. All
                                            the meats purchased by me are submitted to a rigid
                                            inspection.
                                        3d. Another charge he understands to be that your
                                            Commissary has been taking duplicate bills of purchase.
                                            In most cases such has been the fact, and is now
                                            continued, for the reason that he is unable to see any
                                            other plan by which he would be enabled to prevent the
                                            second presentation of bills once paid, as the original
                                            bills, being filed in the Auditor's office, would not be
                                            accessible at all times so as to know whether or not
                                            some of the bills or parts of them had not previously
                                            been presented and paid. If your honorable body can
                                            suggest, through a committee or otherwise, any better
                                            plan your Commissary would be pleased to adopt it.
                                        In conclusion your Commissary would remark that the
                                            position is one very difficult to fill satisfactorily to
                                            everybody; and that, even in the testimony taken by your
                                            honorable committee, which testimony your Commissary had
                                            no opportunity to confront or rebut, there were
                                            interested statements made by parties who had previously
                                            made propositions of partnership, but which propositions
                                            were rejected by me on account of the dishonest
                                            intimations therein contained.
                                        Your Commissary therefore prays your honorable body to
                                            appoint a committee before whom he may have an
                                            opportunity of confronting witnesses and introducing
                                            such testimony as will relieve the minds of the
                                            committee) from the serious and unjust charges your
                                            resolution, as passed, would seem to infer; which prayer
                                            being granted, your Commissary entertains not the least
                                            shadow of doubt that he can show beyond cavil every
                                            dollar of the State's passing through his hands has been
                                            judiciously and economically expended.
                                        
                                            ISAIAH MANSUR,
                                            Com. Gen. Ind,
                                                Militia.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. FRASIER. Mr. Speaker: I was one that voted for that resolution;
                                and, as I stated before, I have no acquaintance with the Commissary.
                                I did not even know his politics till a few days ago. It is a rule
                                with me, in all cases, sir, to grant to the party accused an
                                opportunity of being heard, if he has not had it. I supposed, also,
                                that this gentlemen had had opportunity; and now I am not
                                entirely satisfied with his explanation. I can't see that much has
                                been gained by it. I take it for granted that there was no means for
                                roasting and grinding the soldier's coffee at the commencement. But
                                I can't see how anything was gained by mixing in the beans. I can't
                                see what has been gained by the Commissary's statement. But if there
                                has been a chance for statements and charges by interested parties,
                                and the Commissary has not had a fair opportunity for confronting
                                and cross-examining witnesses in regard to them, I am still willing
                                to give him a hearing. I know that if we take a course of this kind
                                we ought to do it with becoming firmness, but at the same time we
                                ought to be willing to mete out equal and exact justice. Therefore,
                                I now move a reconsideration of the vote by which we adopted the
                                resolution requesting the Governor to remove the Comissary General
                                from his office.
                            Mr. PARRETT. Mr. Speaker: I was a member of the committee that made
                                the report on this case. But I was not here on Saturday afternoon
                                when the resolution was passed which it is now propose to
                                reconsider. Indeed, I cared but little about taking part in the
                                consideration of the report. I felt this way: That, if the Governor
                                could believe the testimony and the report of the committee, and did
                                not see proper thereupon to remove the Commissary, he might assume
                                the responsibility. I have now but a few considerations to submit.
                                The witnesses before the committee were examined, not only by Mr.
                                Mansur himself, but also by all who are employed by him and
                                immediately interested in his affairs. We endeaved as far as we
                                could to ascertain not only the truth, but the whole truth, as far
                                as the committee were able to accomplish that object. It is true, we
                                did not request Mr. Mansur (nor did we prohibit him) to come in
                                before the committee and subpoena, examine, and cross-examine
                                witnesses; and I think the House is satisfied that if he had asked
                                for that privilege, as a general rule, we would have been foolish if
                                we had granted it ; for the reason that the entire vacation of the
                                session was taken up by the committee, working as hard as men ought
                                to work. Almost every clay, from eight or nine in the morning till
                                five in the afternoon, we were in committee session, or on the Camp
                                ground, laboring in the matter - not taking a one-sided view - but
                                putting together that which was against him and that which was for
                                him, with equal restrictions and favor. The report is not a severe
                                report. I am reluctant always to conduct a charge against any man
                                that looks toward dishonesty But when a necessity is placed upon me,
                                and when the interests of the State and the people we represent are
                                at stake, and the interests of men called out to protect the country
                                are all at stake, I say, a man placed  upon such a committee, under such
                                circumstances, dare not, if he would, shrink his responsibility. I
                                am aware, and I suppose all are aware, that at least that portion of
                                the committee that remained here were all members of what used to
                                be, and still is, the Republican party. I understand that Mr. Mansur
                                is also of that party. The suggestion of the gentleman from
                                Kosciusko has no weight with me.
                            Mr. FRASIER. I stated that I did not know, up to the time of this
                                investigation, what his politics were.
                            Mr. PARRETT. And I would to God I had never known what they were. I
                                do not know the purpose of having a reconsideration; but I presume
                                it is to have another committee appointed to hear the case again; to
                                bring parties before them and hear pleadings and examine and
                                cross-examine witnesses. And I say here that if you do that your
                                committee must sit during another vacation, and if they will arrive
                                at the whole truth they must sit from now till another Legislature
                                shall be elected by the people, or they will not be able to satisfy
                                those men. The object of the present committee was not to convict.
                                We leave that to the courts. But the object was to ascertain whether
                                this Commissary and the Quartermaster General hand been and were
                                acting properly. I have stated that all the time we were at work we
                                put in our time faithfully. You had the whole matter of our
                                investigations before you on Saturday. I said not a word in regard
                                to it. The report shows for itself. The evidence shows for itself.
                                Whereupon this House passed a solemn resolution, and I trust, for
                                conscience sake, that they will let it rest there. Why distrust it?
                                We have now heard the formal answer of the Commissary. It was no
                                stronger than that which was before the committee. It was all put
                                into the mouths of his witnesses, and they repeated it. The
                                committee have heard it a thousand times. If he is aggrieved by the
                                proceeding why does he not say where and how far it has been wrong,
                                and who has done wrong in the matter? As far as I am concerned, I am
                                willing to take the responsibility for the part I took in it, and
                                stand by the evidence and the report. And is not the report
                                sustained a thousand fold? What does he say? He can't say for the
                                life of him why, when he was furnishing such pork, men should not
                                complain; nor why he was furnishing our troops with pork unfit to be
                                eaten by white men, or men three-eights white; [laughter] hairy,
                                dirty, soft, and unfit for use, except for soap-grease at the rate
                                of six cents per pound, when good pork could have been bought for
                                five and twelve hundreths cents,if the reason was not simply that
                                the soldiers should eat his rotten meat, and the State pay him a
                                high price for it! There is nothing in the report tracing blame to
                                Mr. Mansur about the coffee. But certain it is that it was such a
                                mixture as has not been recorded since the days of Homoeopathe
                                medicine. (I beg pardon to doctors.) It was like the mixture of the
                                farmers with a few grains of wheat and a bushel of rye. It was the
                                mixture of a sprinkle of coffee with a lot of bad beans. [Laughter.]
                                Sir, shall we reconsider the act of the House based upon such
                                conduct? With regard to the blank and duplicate receipts, he says he
                                knew no other way. But we have found that the Quartermaster has
                                managed in another way. He has a little line on his receipts which
                                answers just as well as to file them double.
                            On the motion of Mr. PACKARD, the motion to reconsider was laid on
                                the table - affirmative 34, negative 26.

                            
                                FOURTEETH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.
                                The SPEAKER announced the special order, viz.: The consideration
                                    of Mr. Collins, of Whitley's bill [40], creating the 14th
                                    Judicial Circuit, as amended by the Committee on
                                        Organization of Courts of Justice.
                                Mr. WOODHULL answered objections urged against the bill by Mr.
                                    Nebeker and others. He had learned, however, that there was
                                    opposition to the bill from within the bounds of the proposed
                                    circuit, and thereupon he moved that the bill be recommitted to
                                    a select committee of one member from each county of the Tenth
                                    Judicial Circuit, out of which it is proposed to form the 14th
                                    circuit.
                                The SPEAKER thereupon appointed Messrs. Woodhull, Parrett,
                                    Horton, Feigler, Randall, Frasier, Jenkinson, Collins of
                                    Whitley, Collins of Adams, and Anderson of Elkhart.
                            
                            
                                PHINEAS PALMER AND OTHERS.
                                Mr. MOSS submitted the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the
                                                  Committee on Ways and Means be
                                                instructed to examine the certificates for work done
                                                by Phinea Palmer, M. Pool, E. Sabin, A. C. H.
                                                Walker, John S. Simons, Thos. Mason, and others, in
                                                draining swamp lands in the county of Greene; and if
                                                found to be correct, to provide in the general
                                                appropriation bill for the payment of the same out
                                                of the swamp land fund of said county now in the
                                                State Treasury - to be reported by said committee to
                                                this House.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. MOSS. In our county last fall there was a lot of these lands
                                    let out for ditching; and these men took the contracts and did
                                    the work, and have not yet been fible to get their money. There
                                    is something like $11,000 of our Green county swamp land money
                                    in the treasury, and the State Auditor refuses to draw it out on
                                    account of the embezzlement bill. This is to inquire into the
                                    matter and authorize the paying of these men. They need their
                                    money.
                                Mr. PARRETT. Was it a fact that the House was going to refer
                                    these particular canes cf swamp land claims, each to be examined
                                    by a committee here? He thought there ought to be a general
                                    provision of law regulating these cases.
                                Mr. BRETT explained again, that the object was to relieve the
                                    Auditor from embarrassment about the disbursment of this swamp
                                    land money. There was certainly a great  handship here on the part of those
                                    who have done this swamp land ditching.
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN (Mr. Line in the Chair) said the House had
                                    already passed a bill embracing these cases. Then he objected
                                    particularly to the resolution, as an incautious proceeding in
                                    the management of a fund whichwas already overdrawn and indebted
                                    to the State over $200,000. So whatever claim to be found
                                    against the swamp land fund must come out of the general fund of
                                    the State. He might not object to it if it was merely a
                                    resolution of inquiry. But a resolution positive in its terms he
                                    could not vote for. Mr. MOSS accepted the modification, and it
                                    as again read by the clerk as a resolution of inquiry.
                                Mr. NEBEKER. There was some $60,000 or $70,000 of this fund not
                                    yet stolen.
                                Mr. ALLEN had obtained his information from the Chairman of the
                                        Committee on Ways and Means.
                                Mr. NEBEKER had stated the conclusion of the Swamp Land
                                        Committee. The papers were all regular in the
                                    office. If he were right, it it was necessary to take
                                    out this fund to pay ditching, it should not be paid out on mere
                                    paper evidence.
                                Mr. DAVIS was unwilling to take from the funds of counties which
                                    had not been drawn to pay claims from counties that have
                                    overdrawn their funds.
                                Mr. BRETT. The Auditor's report showed that on the first day of
                                    last October there was a balance in the treasury of $87,239 17.
                                    It was certainly a hardship that such cases as this from Greene
                                    county, which had $11,000 of this fund undrawn, could not be
                                    paid off.
                                Mr. PARRETT. This was a matter that should not, be touched by
                                    this House or its committees but in the way of general
                                    legislation. The work that might come up in this way would be
                                    interminable.
                                On motion of Mr. THOMAS, the resolution was laid on the table -
                                    affirmative 31, negative 24.
                            
                            
                                SWINGING BRIDGE BILL.
                                Mr. JENKINSON moved to take from the table the swinging bridge
                                    bill [45] (in the corporate limits of cities and towns): and no
                                    quorum voting thereon - a call of the House ascertained that a
                                    quorum was present, and the bill was taken up.
                                Mr. DAVIS proposed to amend by adding "draw-bridges" in the
                                    proper place, which was adopted.
                                Mr. CASON. I move to refer the bill to the committee on
                                        rights and privileges, with instructions to
                                    inquire whether is it right to seize a boat for damaging a canal
                                    bridge.
                                Mr ORR. As a member of the committee on rights and
                                        privileges, I think the judiciary
                                        committee better prepared to decide on legal
                                    right.
                                The SPEAKER. Under this bill a steamboat descending the Ohio
                                    river might be made liable for failing to open a drawer.
                                Mr. JENKINSON. I think, with due respect, that the Speaker's head
                                    must be a little wool-gathering. It applies to canalsnot rivers.
                                    [Laughter.]
                                The SPEAKER. The Speakers head does not often go a
                                    wool-gathering.
                                Mr. JENKINSON. I am aware of that; but it does this time.
                                Mr. BUNDY. I move to lay the bill, as amended, on the table.
                                Mr. JENKINSON. I ask for the yeas and nays on that, and the
                                    gentleman from Steuben joins with me.
                                Mr. FRAZIER. If the bill is not to pass, I would suggest that it
                                    would be better to move to indefinitely postpone it. We have
                                    just taken it from the table.
                                The House refused to lay the bill on the table, by yeas 23, nays
                                    53.
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN, (Mr. Sherman in the chair). I wish to ask the
                                    gentleman from Allen who erected these swinging bridges?
                                Mr. JENKINSON. The city of Fort Wayne.
                                Mr. ALLEN. I do not know what may be the custom up there; but I
                                    do know, that in all places with us, the canal bridges are
                                    erected by the company.
                                Mr. JENKINSON. These bridges are at the crossing of streets of
                                    the city.
                                Mr. ALLEN. I know that in the lower portion of the State, at
                                    every road or street crossing of the canal, the bridge is
                                    erected by the company. It seems to me that there is something
                                    that must be wrong in this bill - something like "a nigger in
                                    the woodpile,"though I regret to make an imputation against the
                                    gentleman from Allen. It strikes me that the lawful trustees of
                                    the canal are compelled to make all the necessary bridges over
                                    their canal, and also to keep them in repair. And if a citizen
                                    or any number of citizens erect private bridges for their own
                                    convenience, there is no reason why a party whose transactions
                                    on the canal are interrupted by it, shall pay damages for
                                    injuries caused by running against them. The law provides ample
                                    remedies for damages done to bridges against those who do the
                                    injury, either simply by a civil action, or by a criminal
                                    prosecution. Damages may be recovered by civil action, and then
                                    the party may be prosecuted for the wilful and malicious act. I
                                    apprehend, that if my friend from Allen would come out and state
                                    the facts about his bill, they are about these: that in his town
                                    some bridges have been erected for private convenience, which
                                    the Canal Company are not bound to build or repair; and now the
                                    people of Fort Wayne want to compel those who navigate the canal
                                    to keep these bridges in repair. I have no doubt this is the
                                    foundation for the introduction of the bill. I hope therefore
                                    that it will not be engrossed. We don't want to pass laws here
                                    to operate merely for the convenience and accommodation of
                                    individual citizens. It is for the gentleman to show that these
                                    bridges  are not adequately
                                    protected by the general law, and until he does that, and shows
                                    a, public necessity tor extending the provisions of that law, I
                                    can see no reason for the passage of his bill. Then again: I am
                                    directly opposed to all sorts of legislation, in any manner or
                                    form, upon subjects connected with that Wabash and Erie
                                    canal.
                                Mr. JENKINSON replied to the imputation of disingeniousness, and
                                    defended the bill, explaining its provisions. To sue these
                                    offenders in a civil action would be to pay the cost yourself.
                                    He wanted nothing but what was right and fair.
                                Mr. ALLEN. Were they not made swinging bridges to avoid unsightly
                                    embankments?
                                Mr. JENKINSON. They were so made for utility as well - for the
                                    benefit of all using the public highways. He would be as
                                    cautious as any man about legislating in connection with that
                                    canal.
                                Mr. BUNDY proposed to amend by adding a clause, to the effect,
                                    that where injury is done to the property of any person by the
                                    careless or malicious driving of a wagon, the injured party
                                    shall have a lien on the wagon for his damages. Mr. B. spoke
                                    against this new remedy by which, if a canal boatman injure a
                                    bridge there shall be a lien on his boat for damages. The very
                                    same principle would give a lien on the owner of a wagon for
                                    damages occasioned by reckless driving. He should oppose, to the
                                    extent of his ability, the inauguration of any such system of
                                    recovering damages.
                                Mr. NEBEKER said, if the bridges had been erected for the
                                    convenience and accommodation of the public at large, they would
                                    have been placed high enough not to inconvenience and discommode
                                    the public at large as they navigate the canal. The bill would
                                    affect the trade of the canal. He insisted, that instead of
                                    compelling the navigators to do it, the city authorities of Fort
                                    Wayne should attend the bridges at their own expense.
                                Mr. JENKINSON wanted to reach the scoundrels that would run
                                    against the bridges near the hinges.
                                Mr. NEBEKER continued humorously to express his opposition to the
                                    bill.
                                Mr. WILLIAMS moved the indefinite postponement of the bill and
                                    pending amendment, and thereupon demanded the previous
                                    question.
                                There was a second, and, under this pressure, the subject was
                                    indefinitely postponed - yeas 48, nays 29 - as follows:

                                So the bill failed.
                            
                            
                                RETIREMENT OF TROOPS ON HALF PAY.
                                Mr. JENKINSON introduced a bill (58) entitled, An act to require
                                    the Governor to retire on half pay all troops in the service of
                                    the State of Indiana that will not enter the service of the
                                    United States, and to repeal all laws in conflict therewith.
                                Mr. FRASIER moved that the bill be rejected.
                                Mr. BUNDY and others stated that, whilst they should vote against
                                    rejection, as a discourteous motion, they were distinctly
                                    opposed to the bill.
                                Mr. FRASIER disclaimed all intention of discourteosness. There
                                    were but two business days more of the session, and he had been
                                    requested to make the motion by several around him, simply to
                                    save time.
                                The House refused to reject - yeas 20, nays 23 - and then the
                                    bill was passed to the second reading.
                            
                            
                                SHERIFFS' MILEAGE.
                                Mr. KITCHEN introduced a bill [59] to regulate the mileage of
                                    sheriffs in conveying convicts to the Northern and Southern
                                    State Prisons, and repealing all laws in conflict therewith. [It
                                    establishes the distances from the several county seats in the
                                    State to the two prisons by the usually traveled routes, making
                                    no material change in the law, except as to the county of
                                    Warrick.]
                                It was passed to the second reading.
                                On the motion of Mr. LANE, (the rules being suspended for the
                                    purpose,) it was read the second time by title.
                                Amendments being proposed -
                                On motion of Mr. NEBEKER, it was made the special order for
                                    to-morrow at 9 o'clock, A. M.
                                The House then, at 4 1/2 o'clock, adjourned.

                        The PRESIDENT laid before the Senate the following communication from the
                            Governor in reply to Senator Claypool's resolution of inquiry adopted
                            yesterday afternoon.

                                        DEPARTMENT, Indianapolis, May 28, 1861.
                                    
                                        To the Senate of the State of Indiana:
                                    
                                    In answer to your resolution of yesterday, calling upon me
                                        for information, I have the honor to submit the following
                                        statements:
                                    Under the six regiment bill I have placed in camp and
                                        organized five regiments of infantry. I am also organizing
                                        two companies of cavalry and two batteries of artillery,
                                        each battery to consist of four 6-pounders and two 12 pound
                                        howitzers all brass. The guns and carriages are being
                                        manufactured, and are expected to be finished in a few
                                        days.
                                    On the 19th day of May, instant, I received a requisition
                                        from the War Department at Washington for four regiments of
                                        infantry, to serve three years, or until discharged. Under
                                        the authority conferred upon the Governor in the six
                                        regiment bill, I determined to turn over, under this
                                        requisition, three of the regiments of State troops
                                        organized under said bill. The proposition to enter the
                                        service for three years was accord-  ingly submitted to the five
                                        regiments, the three to be selected were those, the highest
                                        number of which volunteered for three years' service, and
                                        ranks to be recruited from the other two regiments, or from
                                        outsiders.
                                    True regiment stationed at Terre Haute, through its
                                        commanding officer, Col. Kimball, has reported in full for
                                        the service. The others have not yet been heard from. Two
                                        regiments of infantry, with two batteries of artillery and
                                        two companies of cavalry, will be left in the service and
                                        under the pay of the State.
                                    There is some prospect, however, that the companies of
                                        cavalry may be drafted into a regiment of cavalry being
                                        raised by the General Government from Ohio, Indiana and
                                        Illinois. I intend further to organize under the General
                                        Militia law one company of cavalry in each of the counties
                                        bordering on the Ohio river, the men to furnish their
                                        horses, saddles and bridles, and the State the arms and
                                        equipments, to be subject to the call of the Governor at any
                                        moment, and when called into actual service, to be paid as
                                        if in the regular service.
                                    Several companies have been tendered for this branch of
                                        service, and orders for their arms have been issued, and I
                                        entertain no doubt of being able to organize efficient
                                        companies on the plan proposed in all the counties referred
                                        to.
                                    I have, for the present, determined not to raise abattery of
                                        Flying Artillery.
                                    The want of experienced officers to take charge of such a
                                        battery, the difficulties attending its drill, together with
                                        the great expense, seemed to render it expedient not to
                                        undertake it at this time,
                                    
                                        All of which is respectfully submitted.
                                        O. P. MORTON,
                                        Governor.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        On motion by Mr. LINE, the communication was referred to the
                                Committee on Military Affairs.

                        
                            INCREASING THE LENGTH OF STAY OF EXECUTION UPON
                                JUDGEMENTS
                            Mr. WOLFE, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                made the following report:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        MR. PRESIDENT - The Judiciary
                                                committee, to whom was referred Senate
                                            bill No. 25, introduced by Mr. Conley, have had the same
                                            under consideration, and have directed me to report the
                                            same back with a recommendation that it lie on the
                                            table, for the following reasons:
                                        1st. The bill proposes to change the law for the stay of
                                            execution in ail cases, without respect to the amount of
                                            the judgment, or the date of the contract, to one year -
                                            giving the same length of stay on small amounts that is
                                            given on large amounts, which the committee regard as
                                            inexpedient.
                                        2d. The other proposition of the bill, which seeks to
                                            extend the time of stay to prior contracts, the
                                            committee oppose on the ground that such legislation
                                            would be in conflict with the 24th section of the first
                                            article of the constitution of the State, prohibiting
                                            the passage of any law "impairing the obligation of
                                            contracts;" and a similar provision in the constitution
                                            of the United States, (Art. 1, sec. 10.) The meaning of
                                            these constitutional provisions, as applied to the
                                            question before us, has been settled by the Supreme
                                            Court of Indiana, in the case of Dormine et
                                                al vs. Cogley, 8th Blackford, p. 177, in which
                                            it is held by the court, that "Cogley, the plaintiff, by
                                            the law in force previous to the act of 1842, had a
                                            right to take out the execution at the time it issued;
                                            and said act, giving a further stay of execution, could
                                            not effect that right." By the act of 1842, the
                                            Legislature attempted to do, what the bill before us
                                            attempts to do, to-wit: Giving a further stay of
                                            execution on judgments on existing debts. This, we
                                            understand the Supreme Court, in the case cited, have
                                            decided can not be done. The decision was pronounced by
                                            Judge Blackford, and like most of the decisions of that
                                            eminent jurist, has not been questioned from the time it
                                            was given, (May, 1846,) to the present time. The
                                            committee, are therefore of opinion that no relief of
                                            that kind can be given on debts now existing. And as to
                                            debts hereafter contracted, the committee are of the
                                            opinion that such legislation would be inexpedient, for
                                            the reason that parties now or hereafter can make their
                                            contracts with reference to their abilities to pay, and
                                            therefore, such parties do not need such legislative
                                            aid.
                                        
                                            JOHN R. CRAVENS,
                                            President of the Senate.
                                            THOS M. BROWNE,
                                            Sec'y of the Senate.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            THE ELEVENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.
                            Mr. CONNER, from the Committee on the Organization of
                                    Courts, returned Mr. DeHart's 11th Judiciary Circuit
                                bill [S. No. 22] recommending
                                its passage with amendments.
                            Mr. CONNER. I might mention the fact that this is the bill alluded to
                                on yesterday. I did not call the committee together as it was a mere
                                local matter and I supposed it made no difference to gentlemen out
                                of the circuit. I received a line from members of the bar in my own
                                county. A portion of them thought the time is somewhat short, but
                                they are willing to test the matter. The amendments do not change
                                the effect of the bill, but make it a little more perfect.
                            Mr. DeHART. I think the report would be entirely acceptable to
                                members of the bar in the different counties composing the district,
                                and I trust the report will be concurred in.
                            The report was concurred in, and so the amendments were adopted.
                        
                        
                            HIGHWAYS.
                            Mr. MELLETT, from the Committee on Military
                                    Affairs, returned Mr. March's bill, [S. No. 55,]
                                introduced on Saturday, recommending its passage with the 3d section
                                of the proposed amendment, and that the 2d section of the amendment
                                be laid on the table.
                            The report was concurred in.

                                returned his bill, [S. No. 46,] entitled a bill to amend sections 123 and 136 of an act
                                entitled 'an act to provide for the valuation and appraisement of
                                the real and personal property and the collection of taxes in the

                                of real property, County Treasurers and Auditors, and of the

                                returned Mr. Beeson's bill S. No. 49, introduced on Friday, recommending its passage
                                without amendment.
                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            THE TAX DUPLICATE.
                            Mr. SHOEMAKER, from the Committee on County and Township
                                    Business, returned the bill S. No. 50, recommending
                                passage, with an amendment adding these words: "And it is hereby
                                made the duty of Boards of County Commissioners, before paying for
                                making out such tax duplicates, to see that the provisions of this
                                act are complied with."
                            The report was concurred in, and so the amendment was adopted.

                            Mr. TARKINGTON, from the Committee on Education,
                                to whom was referred the bill [H. R No. 24] entitled "A bill to amend

                                returned the same amended, by striking out the 3d section, and after
                                so amending, recommend its passage.
                        
                        
                            APPORTIONMENT OT THE SCHOOL TAX.
                            Mr. ODELL, from the Committee on Education, to
                                whom was referred the communication of the Superintendent of Public
                                Instruction in reply to the Senate resolution of inquiry as to the
                                delay in making the apportionment of the school revenue, reported
                                the same back,with the suggestion that no further action thereon is
                                necessary, as there is a bill being prepared, designed to meet the
                                case.
                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            THE AUDITOR OF STATE.
                            Mr. MILLER, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                made the following report:
                            Mr. President, the Committee on the Judiciary to
                                whom was referred House bill No. 41 - a bill to amend the first
                                section of "An act prescribing the powers and duties of Auditor of
                                State," approved May 27, 1852 - have had the same under
                                consideration, and have directed me to report the same back to the
                                Senate with the recommendation that it lie upon the table. The
                                committee are of the opinion that the bonds now required by law from
                                the Auditor of State, amounting in the aggregate to the sum of
                                thirty-five thousand dollars, are amply sufficient in amount for the
                                security of the State against loss is the department of Auditor of
                                State. The committee are unable to perceive that it is necessary to
                                increase the amount of the bonds of that officer at the present time
                                on account of the issuing of the war loan bonds or for any other
                                reason.
                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            QUALIFICATION OF VOTERS AT SCHOOL MEETINGS.
                            Mr. LINE, from the special committee thereon, made the following
                                report:
                            Mr. President, the committee to whom was referred a resolution
                                instructing said committee to inquire whether any further
                                legislation is necessary to define who are entitled to vote at
                                general or special school meetings, have had the same under
                                consideration, and have directed me to make the following report:
                                The committee, in view of the inquiry of the resolution, were led to
                                examine the law defining the qualifications of voters and who are
                                entitled to vote, were led to the conclusion that the law was
                                sufficiently explicit and definite on the subject, and that the
                                complaints arise not so much from a defect in the law, as it does
                                from a failure on the part of complainant to conform with its
                                requisitions. This being done, there will be no just cause of
                                complaint with regard to the ambiguity of the law; and the committee
                                can only recommend to those who desire to vote at school meetings a
                                thorough examination of the same as a cause of all complaints on the
                                subject.
                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            STAY OF EXECUTION.
                            Mr. LINE offered the following, which was adopted by consent:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the report of the
                                                Committee on the Judiciary on the
                                            subject of staying the collection of debts, be signed by
                                            the President and Secretary of the Senate, and a copy of
                                            the same be published in the Indiana State Sentinel and Indiana State Journal.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            THE SCHOOL FUND.
                            Mr. CARNAHAN. On the resolution acted upon yesterday in relation to
                                the apportionment of the school revenue, I wish to say that I am in
                                favor of compelling every officer to comply with the law; but when I
                                take into consideration the large number of officers who were not a
                                ware of the fact that such a penalty clause was in the law, I must
                                grant them some excuse. As I am of opinion a great many Senators did
                                not understand themselves when the vote was taken yesterday, and I
                                will now call for a recount.
                            After remarks by Messrs. Miner, Tarkington, and DeHart -
                            The motion for a recount was agreed to.
                            Mr. LINE desired unanimous consent to offer the following amendment,
                                which was read for information:
                            Provided, however, that if any county auditor shall
                                file his affidavit before the clerk of the court of the respective
                                counties, that they did not receive a duly certified copy of the law
                                in time to make his report; then and only in that case shall said
                                auditor be exempted from the penalty for neglect of duty.
                            Objection being made, the amendment was not entertained by the
                                Chair.
                            The recount resulted as follows - yeas 28 nays 13 -

                        INDIANAPOLIS, MAY 29, 1861.
                        NO. 13.
                    
                    
                        
                            Committee on Military Affairs, made by Mr. Wolfe,
                                yesterday afternoon, recommending the substitution of his
                                independent company bill S. No. 21, for the Home Guard bill H. R.
                                37; the question being on concurring in the committee report.
                            Mr. MURRAY moved to concur in the report of the committee, with an
                                amendment striking out all in regard to attaching said independent
                                companies to the active militia of the State for battalion and
                                regimental drill.
                            Mr. DeHART moved to amend so as to prohibit persons afflicted with
                                gout, and weighing under three hundred pounds avordupois, from be
                                coming members thereof, and impose a fine upon any member of said
                                company for over exertion on hot days.
                            Mr. MURRAY. The object of my amendment can be attained by striking
                                out the 8th section of the bill. The only objection I have to the
                                bill is that, while it gives these independent companies the benefit
                                of brigade and regimental drills, when troops are called into active
                                service it excuses them from the service. If they are not going into
                                active service it is not necessary for them to understand the
                                regimental or battalion drill, and they should not be allowed to
                                interfere with the active militia by attaching them to the regiments
                                for battalion drills.
                            Mr. WOLFE. I am glad that is the only objection the gentleman has. If
                                this 8th section was imperative, I should be opposed to it myself,
                                but it is left discretionary with the colonel. These companies may
                                be or may not be attached to the militia regiments for drill
                                purposes. I believe there are 270,000 persons in the State between
                                18 and 45 years of age. It is not desirable that any considerable
                                amount of that number should be organized, but it would be well
                                enough to have called out about 200 companies. If organized into
                                regiments, of ten companies each, they would form 30 regiments,
                                which would be a sufficient number. This would connect together, on
                                an average, for regimental drill purposes, three counties. My view
                                is this: let the Governor establish this as his basis, and appoint
                                thirty colonels in the State, one for each regiment. The requisition
                                of the law would be amply filled by a regimental muster in each of
                                the counties once a year. These independent companies would not
                                belong to the regiment proper, but be used simply to fill up the
                                regiment, thereby avoiding the trouble of calling companies from
                                distant points. If this section be objectionable to any colonel, he
                                would not receive these companies, of course; but in sparse-ly
                                settled counties they would unquestionably be a great convenience in
                                the ready organization of regiments. These companies will be as
                                efficient organizations, in many cases, as any others, and, when a
                                call Is made for active service, I apprehend they would be as ready
                                to enlist as the other military organizations. I apprehend the bill
                                would be much better with this section in it. If the Senate will not
                                agree to let it remain, why, of course it must be struck out, but I
                                hope it will be allowed to remain.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. I am opposed to the whole system, not from the fact
                                that the bill is introduced by the Senator from Harrison, very far
                                from it, but I take it that this bill is perhaps no better than the
                                one that came from the other end of the capitol. If our military law
                                is defective, I am willing to vote to amend it, but I am opposed to
                                creating a system that may be said to be a system within a system.
                                The idea of having two military systems in one State is not right.
                                The principal effect of this bill will be to draw the fire from the
                                other militia bill, now a law. When I voted to appropriate $70,000
                                under the militia bill, it was with the idea that the men drilled
                                under it should obey the call of the State. I am tired of this thing
                                of child's play, and I will not vote money to put epaulettes upon
                                any man's shoulder for mere display. A home guard! What home will
                                you protect? I say that term, in its broadest acceptation, means all
                                the homes in this broad confederacy. I have no particular objections
                                to this bill over Mr. Gresham's, introduced in the other end of the
                                capitol. The only object in this bill seems to be to suck the
                                life-blood out of our present military law, and, when the country
                                calls, these independent companies may not respond. I don't say they
                                will not. If it is for the protection of our homes, let us act under
                                the system already adopted, or, if it be for military instruction,
                                let us authorize military schools. I shall be unwilling to vote for
                                this bill, in any shape or form, and should like to see a motion
                                made to lay the report and amendments on the table. I am in favor of
                                the proposition of the Senator
                                from Elkhart, [Mr. Murray] as far as it goes.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I think this Legislature ought to adopt some bill to
                                permit men over 45 years of age to organize themselves into
                                companies. We don't want any of these home guards in the northern
                                part of the State, but we have acted upon the supposition that we
                                ought to have a perfect military organization on the frontier, and I
                                want them disconnected from the active militia. For that reason I
                                have offered this amendment. I think it way wrong to exclude from
                                the military bill men over 45 years of age, and I must say so here
                                in my place. These old men have three times more interest at stake
                                than the younger men, and I am for permitting a bill to be passed
                                which will organize these into home guards.
                            Mr. MILLER. The main objection to this bill is, that, in its
                                practical operations, it will use up a portion of the military fund,
                                and that it is entirely unnecessary. Even if the State is attacked I
                                don't think we will need any of these home guards. It but enables
                                men to play military, without ever expecting to go into the service.
                                If it cost nothing I would not care anything about it. I don't see
                                why a very effective militia cannot be organized under our present
                                laws, for I believe the bill is ample in its provisions, though I
                                think it has not money enough in it. I believe this bill is a sort
                                of sheep in Wolfe's clothing. I don't believe it
                                will hurt anybody, and I move to recommit with the following
                                instructions:
                            Amend in the proper place as follows:
                            Nothing in this act contained shall be so construed as to prevent
                                "Independent Sedentary Guards," provided for in this act, from
                                disbanding in case of war; and that they shall not be required to
                                leave the State, except in case of invasion; and that said "Home
                                Guards" shall not be prevented from placing women and children in
                                the front ranks for means of protection, if such militia be attacked
                                and decide not to run.
                            Mr. ANTHONY. I am willing to treat this bill seriously, though I
                                regard it in the same light as gentlemen who are disposed to
                                ridicule it. Under existing circumstances we ought to examine it
                                earnestly and candidly. Most young men, and older men, have diverse
                                inducements for joining military organizations. Some join with a
                                desire to fight for the State, others for mere ostentation, and
                                these latter would probably join the organization under the present
                                military system, but if they can make the same display without
                                incurring the liabilities of the soldier they would organize under
                                this bill. The most, serious objection to this bill is that, under
                                the color of law, it inaugurates a wholly irresponsible system. It
                                would be getting up an organization that could be controlled by no
                                one, and that might be used for the purpose of inflicting a great
                                deal of evil upon the State. I am not going to attribute bad motives
                                to any one, but suppose we should find our State in the same
                                position the people of the United States found Maryland and
                                Missouri. These independent companies could be independent of all
                                control, for no one would have the right to disorganize them, and
                                they might become an engine of destruction to the interests of the
                                State. They don't take even an oath to support the Constitution of
                                the United States. The officers are required to take an oath, and
                                that is all there is of it. Now in the military organization we have
                                passed, each man swears as follows: [See page 123 of these reports.]
                                Now if men, under our military system, are disposed to act
                                improperly, they can be made ameanable to law under this oath. But
                                under the system proposed by the Senator from Harrison [Mr. Wolfe]
                                they are under obligations to no one - are setf operating
                                institutions, and might be used under certain circumstances for very
                                bad purposes. It would be creating two military systems in the State
                                - one having the power to interfere with and deter the other. I know
                                nothing about the merits of the bill from the House, but I do not
                                like the plan of getting up outside institutions.
                            Mr. COBB. Whilst this bill does not come up to all I desire, yet the
                                principle in it is good, and I doubt not it will have a beneficial
                                effect upon the people of the State. We have a class of men who do
                                not desire to go into active service, but who would be willing to
                                stand as sentinels upon the house tops of their own towns or
                                counties. However slightly it may be considered by some gentlemen, I
                                believe this bill should pass with a few amendments which I shall
                                offer at the proper time. It has been drawn with a great deal of
                                care, and comes nearer meeting the wants of the people, I think,
                                than any one yet offered. I will propose to amend by requiring these
                                independent companies to take the prescribed oath, exempting them
                                from uniforming, and preventing them from being attached to any
                                regular regiment organized under the bill we have already
                                passed.
                            On motion by Mr. JOHNSTON, the motion to recommit and Mr. Miller's
                                amendment were laid on the table.
                            On motion by Mr. CONLEY, the amendments of Messrs. Murray and DeHart
                                were also laid on the table.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL moved to indefinitely postpone the further consideration
                                of the bills and report.
                            Mr. COBB made an ineffectual motion - yeas 16, nays 22 - to lay this
                                motion to postpone on the table.
                            Mr. COBB. The people desire some such bill as this, and we ought to
                                give it to them. Senators are mistaken if they think the object of
                                this bill is to weaken the military law. This is a measure of
                                necessity and ought to be adopted because of its intrinsic
                                merits.
                            Mr. WOLFE. If the independent military company system will dilute the
                                law already passed, as has been suggested by gentlemen here, then
                                that law ought to be strengthened. For the  purpose of keeping a military spirit,
                                these companies should be organized, and thus aid the military
                                system of the State. I know the necessities of the people of the
                                border, and I know that desire such a bill as this. I have no
                                further interest in it than any other man residing there. You may
                                kill this bill if you will, but these companies will be organized
                                with or without law. I do hope the report of the committee will be
                                concurred in.
                            Messrs. Miller and Cobb here indulged in some rather personal
                                remarks.
                            The question being on the motion to indefinitely postpone, it was
                                agreed to by yeas 21, nays 19-as follows:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        YEAS - Messrs. Anthony, Bearss, Beeson, Berry, Blair,
                                            Claypool, Conner, Cravens of Jefferson, DeHart, Hull,
                                            March, Mellett, Miller, Murray, Odell, Robinson, Steele,
                                            Stone, Teegarden, Turner and White - 21.
                                        NAYS - Messrs. Carnahan, Cobb, Conley, Craven of Madison,
                                            Dickinson, Ferguson, Hamilton, Johnston, Jones, Line,
                                            Lomax, Ray, Shoulders, Slack, Studabaker, Williams,
                                            Wilson and Wolfe - 19.
                                    
                                
                            
                            So the bills and report were indefinitely postponed.
                            Mr. CONLEY made an ineffectual attempt to offer for the consideration
                                of the Senate a joint resolution authorizing the Auditor of State to
                                draw his warrant on the Treasurer to-day for the ditching of swamp
                                lands.
                            And then came the recess till two o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            Mr. BEESON offered the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That no Senator shall speak
                                            longer than five minutes on any proposition before the
                                            Senate without the unanimous consent of this honorable
                                            body.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. WOLFE opposed and Mr. BEESON favored its passage.
                            Mr. WOLFE made an ineffectual motion yeas 8 to nays 26 - to lay the
                                resolution on the table.
                            On motion by Mr. SLACK, the resolution was amended by striking out
                                "five" and inserting "ten."
                            Mr. TARKINGTON moved to further amend by providing that no bill shall
                                be introduced after this day for the consideration of the Senate;
                                but immediately withdrew it.

                            
                                SESSION HOURS.
                                Mr. STONE offered the following resolution:
                                That the standing rule of the Senate numbered "one" be so amended
                                    as to require the morning session of the Senate to commence at
                                    eight o'clock A. M., and the afternoon session to commence at
                                    one and one half o'clock P. M. during the remainder of the
                                    session.
                                The resolution lies on the table for one day under the rules of
                                    the Senate.

                                On motion by Mr. SLACK, it was -
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the committee
                                                appointed by this Senate at the last meeting thereof
                                                for the purpose of investigating the swamp land
                                                frauds be requested to report to this Senate on
                                                to-morrow morning what progress has been made in the
                                                investigation of said frauds; what progress they
                                                have made in said investigation; what length of time
                                                they have been engaged, and how many persons are and
                                                have been employed in said service.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                PAY FOR DITCHING SWAMP LANDS.
                                Mr. CONLEY offered the following joint resolution [S. No. 9],
                                    entitled:
                                A joint resolution instructing the Auditor of State to draw his
                                    warrant on the treasurer to pay the ditching of lands swamp, and
                                    instructing the Treasurer of State to pay the same.
                                WHEREAS, the Legislature of this State, at its session in the
                                    year of our Lord, A. D. 1857, did pass an act to enable the
                                    different counties in the State having a swamp land fund to
                                    ascertain and use the amount thereof for the purpose of ditching
                                    the swamp lands therein.
                                AND WHEREAS, in compliance with the provisions of the act above
                                    named certain persons have performed labor in ditching swamp
                                    lands in their respective counties.
                                AND WHEREAS, the Auditor of State has refused to audit the claims
                                    of persons who have performed labor in compliance with the
                                    law.
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Therefore be it Resolved by the General
                                                  Assembly of the State of Indiana, That the
                                                Auditor of State be requested, and he is hereby
                                                instructed to draw his warrant on the Treasurer of
                                                State for the payment of said claims if he shall be
                                                satisfied by the filing of vouchers and the
                                                certificate of the Swamp Land Commissioner that the
                                                claims are right and just.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            And be it further Resolved, That it
                                                shall be the duty of the Treasurer of State to pay,
                                                when presented by the person holding the claim, or
                                                his agent, any sum which may be audited for ditching
                                                of swamp lands, out of the fund belonging to the
                                                county in which the ditching was done.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                After remarks by Messrs. Conley, Blair, Studabaker and Newcomb
                                    -
                                On motion by Mr. STUDABAKER, the resolutions was referred to the
                                        Judiciary Committee.
                            
                            
                                ADJOURNMENT SINE DIE.
                                On motion by Mr. JOHNSTON, it was -
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Senate will, the
                                                House concurring therein, adjourn sine
                                                  die on Saturday the 1st day of June next.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                CENSURE OF THE COMMISSARY GENERAL.
                                Mr. MURRAY offered the following:
                                WHEREAS, A committee of the Senate were
                                    ordered to investigate the affairs of the Commissary department
                                    of the Volunteer forces of this State, during the recess of the
                                    Legislature; AND WHEREAS, The report of that committee show
                                    conclusively, that the Commissary General has been guilty of
                                    gross mismanagement and negligence, which has resulted in
                                    hardship to our volunteers and loss to the State; therefore
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Governor be, and
                                                he is hereby respectfully requested to remove the
                                                present Commissary General from office.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. CLAYPOOL spoke for five minutes or more in opposition to the
                                    resolution.
                                Mr. MURRAY. I based this resolution upon the investigating
                                    committee's report, and the evidence elicited before that
                                    committee, and I am prepared to vote for this resolution if
                                    there is not another Senator upon this floor voting with me. It
                                    came with an ill grace from a Senator upon this floor in defense
                                    of a Commissary General, or any other General, after such
                                    reports as we have heard have been made to both branches of the
                                    Legislature, and denounce their report as infamous. The position
                                    the gentleman from Fayette occupies in regard to this Commissary
                                    General is well understood 
                                    on this floor, for at the very incipiency of this investigation
                                    he arose and declared that he was personally a warm friend of
                                    this Commissary General, that he bad been acquainted with him
                                    from his youth up, and his denouncing the two investigating
                                    committee's reports as infamous, must be attributed to no other
                                    than this warm personal feeling. He stands here as a defender of
                                    this Commissary General after these reports have been made, sir,
                                    and when this testimony could be doubled and trebled by every
                                    volunteer on those grounds where they drank down his rotten
                                    beans and parched wheat, and eat his rotten pork, sir, which of
                                    itself was enough to turn the stomach of a horse. I have,
                                    myself, eat at the table where these things were, sir, and short
                                    weight at that. The Senate has authorized the publication of the
                                    testimony showing up this imposition upon these troops, our
                                    neighbors and friends have sent forth; and it comes with an ill
                                    grace, I must say again, for the Senator to denounce this report
                                    as "infamous." If he is a friend to this Commissary, and desires
                                    to defend him, let him vote against this resolution, and let the
                                    evidence go out, and see where the gentleman from Fayette
                                    stands. He will be on the side of the Commissary General, with
                                    his parched beans and wheat and his stinking meat, and we will
                                    be on the side of the volunteers who have been compelled to
                                    swallow this or starve, and by which they have been made sick,
                                    many of them. I was in the House of Representatives when this
                                    evidence was read, and the House unanimously, without a
                                    dissenting voice, voted to instruct the Governor to turn that
                                    Commissary out of office. Instead of denouncing their proceeding
                                    as "infamous," I sanction everything they have done in the
                                    verdict they have rendered upon the testimony. And I can inform
                                    the Senator further, that the Committee have offered the
                                    Commissary every possible facility for exhonorating himself.
                                Mr. HULL. The committee frequently had the Commissary General
                                    before them for the purpose of making explanations.
                                Mr. MURRAY. Did you deny him any privileges?
                                Mr. HULL. None sir. 
                                Mr. MURRAY. No, sir. But here is a pet put into office, and kept
                                    there in spite of malfeasance in office, the vote of the House
                                    and his damnable treatment of the volunteers. Now I want the
                                    voice of the Senate, in addition to the sense of the House of
                                    Representatives, that he is no longer worthy or fit to be a
                                    Commissary General to feed our troops.
                                Mr. HAMILTON. His answers to the first resolutions I introduced
                                    in this body inquiring into the affairs of his office, showed,
                                    to my mind, that he was not coming up to what he ought to. My
                                    motives in introducing those resolutions was to protect the
                                    funds of the State. I was satisfied, from all I heard, and from
                                    what I now hear, that the State of Indiana has been filched out
                                    of large sums Of money. The Commissary, as soon as the troops
                                    came here should have let out the supplies by public contract,
                                    and he ought not to have furnished a single pound from his own
                                    stores. Every man who knows him will tell you that he is a good
                                    business man, but I doubt whether there is a business man, in
                                    Indiana that will say that was a business-like transaction. I
                                    move to make this the special order for to-morrow at 3
                                    o'clock.
                                Mr. CLAYPOOL. I would not lend myself to break down the character
                                    of any man without hearing the evidence. I was opposed to acting
                                    on this resolution now, from the reason that I knew nothing
                                    about it. I was informed by the Commissary General that he had
                                    desired, but was refused, to have witnesses brought before the
                                    committee; but I am formed by the Senator from Ripley [Mr. Hull]
                                    that is not the fact. I do not know whether it is or not. Both
                                    are honorable men; but I have no doubt the committee was right.
                                    While I am, and ever have been, a personal friend of Mr. Mansur
                                    I would not go too far in defense; and I say my record is not in
                                    that direction. I was one of the first to join the Senate in
                                    ferreting out the matter The remarks I made then [see pages 23,
                                    30, 36 and 63 of these reports,] indicate that I was not
                                    desirous of screening that gentleman. I introduced a resolution,
                                    a printed copy of which I hold in my hand, that was not intended
                                    to screen him, and he responded to it to the entire satisfaction
                                    of the select committee. If Mr. Mansur has been guilty of these
                                    charges I would be as willing to vote a censure as any other man
                                    upon this floor. Some Senators who may have read that report may
                                    be ready to vote upon the resolution, but to press this matter
                                    now is placing us in a false light. If the evidence shows that
                                    Mr. Mansur has done a disreputable act I shall be one among the
                                    first to vote a vote of censure. I do not understand, from the
                                    hurried reading of the report at the Secretary's desk, that the
                                    committee so censure him. If half is true I will vote to request
                                    the Governor to discharge him.
                                Mr. COBB. I am with the Senator from Fayette [Mr. Claypool] as
                                    far as preparation is concerned. If, however, the vote should be
                                    pressed now, with the evidence I have before me, I should be
                                    bound to vote for the resolution, but I do not feel willing that
                                    the vote should be taken with the information I have now. I
                                    understand from the journals of the House that the report of
                                    this joint committee was made to that end of the Capitol, and
                                    they had it read there with the testimony. The journal says [see
                                    page of these reports,] that it took up an hour's time to read
                                    it, and I see that seventy votes were cast for the resolution of
                                    censure, and none against it. I am in favor of the motion to
                                    postpone the matter till to-morrow.
                                Mr. LINE. I hope this subject will be post-  poned. I am not prepared now to
                                    vote upon the resolution, and as the Senator from Fayette has
                                    said,I will not vote upon a question censuring a man unless I
                                    see the evidence. I will take occasion to exculpate my friend
                                    [Mr. Claypool] although he is amply able to do it himself, from
                                    any undue personal feelings in case. He got up in his seat and
                                    said [see page 36 of these Reports] that such a report was not
                                    satisfactory to him, and insisted upon a thorough investigation
                                    of the affair. Subsequently this committee was raised to
                                    investigate this whole affair.
                                Mr. CRAVEN. I would like to know whether we can have the evidence
                                    so we can read it before 3 o'clock to-morrow.
                                Mr. COBB. I understand it can be laid on our desks by to-morrow
                                    morning.
                                Mr. TARKINGTON. I am willing to vote with the Senator from Allen
                                    [Mr. Hamilton] in having this matter postponed. As far as coffee
                                    being mixed and the meat not being good, that could be without
                                    the knowledge of his officer, but when it comes to paying out
                                    money and not attempting to account for it, that amounts to
                                    another thing. But I say let us postpone this thing, and not
                                    condemn the man without evidence.
                                Mr. HULL. I would state that when we went o the Auditor's office
                                    to obtain the vouchers re found the Commissary had them in his
                                    possession. We summoned him before us and he made such
                                    explanations as he thought proper. We had his assistant and the
                                    Inspector General before us, and these men were witnesses n his
                                    favor. He requested us to send for the inspector General and we
                                    did it. Every request was readily and cheerfully granted to
                                    aim.
                                The motion to make the subject a special order for three o'clock,
                                    to-morrow afternoon, was agreed to.
                            
                            
                                OUR BRAVE VOLUNTEERS.
                                Mr. DEHART offered the following concurrent resolutions
                                    expressive of the sentiments entertained by the General Assembly
                                    for the volunteers of the State of Indiana, for their prompt and
                                    patriotic response to their country's call:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Senate (the
                                                House concurring) contemplate with mingled feelings
                                                of pride and gratitude the prompt and patriotic
                                                action of the volunteers of Indiana, in coming
                                                forward, without distinction of party, to stand
                                                shoulder to shoulder in defence of our country's
                                                flag.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Further Resolved, That while we are
                                                deeply sensible of the magnitude of the issue to be
                                                decided in the struggle already begun in our
                                                country, and before the civilized world, we have
                                                full confidence that the gallant sons of Indiana
                                                will meet this shock of battle like veterans, and
                                                perform fully the part of our loyal State in
                                                crushing out rebellion, and preserving intact the
                                                government bequeathed to us by our fathers.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Further Resolved, That whenever our
                                                gallant troops may march under our country's flag,
                                                they shall be the object of our care - and it shall
                                                be our cheerful duty as legislators to make every
                                                provision for their wants as soldiers and patriots.
                                                The resolutions were adopted nem.

                                On motion by Mr. TARKINGTON, Mr. Cravens' cavalry joint
                                    resolution S. No. 6, introduced yesterday afternoon, was taken
                                    up.
                                Mr. President CRAVENS. [Mr. Tarkington in the Chair.] Mr.
                                    President: On yesterday some Senators said they would be ready
                                    to vote upon this proposition when they had certain information
                                    which was called for by a resolution of the Senate. That
                                    resolution we have, and I have it before me now. It is not
                                    substantially what I stated to the Senate on yesterday, and that
                                    was although we had been here so long a time and had done all
                                    the emergency required of us to do, we are now about as
                                    defenceless as when we first came here. We have called twelve
                                    regiments into-the field and ten or at least eight of them have
                                    been handed over to the Federal service, and we have now barely
                                    two regiments. The Senator from Knox [Mr. Williams] introduced
                                    an amendment requiring the Governor to organize one of the six
                                    organized under the six regiment bill into a regiment of
                                    cavalry; but by this information from His Excellency we see that
                                    is wholly impracticable. It is said that all the regiments
                                    organized, with the exception of the one of eight companies,
                                    have been sworn into the service for a period of three years.
                                    [Mr. C. read the communication from the Governor, printed in the
                                    first of this day's proceedings.] Now it may be said that if the
                                    Governor proceeds to organize these thirteen companies of
                                    cavalry we will not need the regiment we are now asking for by
                                    this joint resolution. I do not propose now to criticize the
                                    language of the Governor, for I apprehend that this
                                    communication was written in haste, and without so much regard
                                    to, its meaning. Under the provisions of the general militia law
                                    I apprehend the Governor has no more right to organize a company
                                    of cavalry than the Muscat of Turkey. Companies may organize
                                    themselves. The Governor has power to group companies into a
                                    regiment, and by that means he can organize a regiment; but he
                                    has no more power to organize a company than I have. He proposes
                                    to organize thirteen companies. That I apprehend is more than we
                                    want. It will cost the State $500,000 every year, and the
                                    question is do we want it for the purpose contemplated by the
                                    resolution? Then the Governor goes on to say that he will equip
                                    these companies with arms, provided they furnish horses. Now
                                    there is no such provision us that in the militia law. If they
                                    are organized strictly under that, the probability is they will
                                    have their horses furnished them. We are simply proposing that
                                    "eight companies shall come into the field, and furnish their
                                    own horses, but the government shall pay a per
                                        diem for the risk and use of these horses.
                                Mr. RAY (interposing.) Does this resolution contemplate that the
                                    Governor shall or-  ganize
                                    these companies under the present militia law or the six
                                    regiment bill?
                                Mr CRAVENS. The militia law.
                                Mr. RAY. Then, the Governor has no authority to organize such
                                    cavalry under the militia law, and how can he get such authority
                                    by a joint resolution?
                                Mr. CRAVENS. We are simply requesting the Governor to call them
                                    in and organize them under the law, with a provision that they
                                    furnish their own horses, and otherwise be organized under the
                                    law. We wish it an efficient force. We ask that they have just
                                    such arms and equipments as the service may require. It is a
                                    small force, therefore we want it properly armed. We have
                                    everything we want except the carbines, and they can be had at
                                    twenty day's notice. Eight companies equipped as provided for by
                                    this resolution are worth twenty companies equipped with the old
                                    fashioned horse pistol, sabre and rifle. I do not propose to
                                    discuss the matter any further, for I apprehend there is not a
                                    Senator upon this floor whose mind is not made up. If the
                                    evidence in their minds is that we do not need this force, the
                                    resolution will fail and we will remain as we have been, without
                                    defense and without protection. When we passed the six regiment
                                    bill it was almost the unanimous voice of this Legislature that
                                    we wanted a home army. It-was said on this floor that
                                        that looked like a small army when looking the
                                    crisis in the face, and it was a small army. But we now have
                                    left a very small portion of that, and we don't know but that
                                    when the sun goes down that we will have a shadow of an army or
                                    a ghost of a regiment.
                                Mr. STUDABAKER. I can't see that the State of Indiana is without
                                    defense. With martial music still sounding in our ears, and
                                    eight or ten thousand troops in the field. I voted for this six
                                    regiment bill with the understanding that, as events shaped
                                    themselves, the Governor would have the power to turn them over
                                    to the General Government or send them home. I believe in the
                                    idea of having a man to manage the affairs of State, and the
                                    action of the Governor in turning over to the United States
                                    service these four regiments I approbate to the fullest extent,
                                    as also his action with reference to the employment of cavalry.
                                    I move to refer the resolution to the Committee on
                                        Military Affairs.
                                Mr. RAY did not see any propriety in adopting the resolution at
                                    this time. The Governor ought to have organized a full regiment
                                    of cavalry under the six regiment bill in the first place, and
                                    he ought to do it yet.
                                Mr. MURRAY. I am satisfied that the Senate has gone far enough in
                                    voting for men for the State defense. There is no more a
                                    necessity, now that we have a superabundant force in the field.
                                    We have voted for five thousand stand of arms to be distributed
                                    in the Southern counties-
                                Mr. CRAVENS (interposing.) Have they been distributed?
                                Mr. MURRAY did not know, but if not let a resolution be adopted
                                    over again directing it to be done. A great many reports are
                                    being circulated that this additional regiment is being formed
                                    for the purpose of giving place to pets; officers have been put
                                    over troops against their remonstrance and that were not fit to
                                    occupy the places. This is all wrong, &c.
                                Mr. WOLFE. The councils of our military gentlemen are badly
                                    confused. They order a thing to-day and to-morrow come to a
                                    different conclusion. A great deal of panic exists throughout
                                    this body and the town in regard to military matters. We don't
                                    want any men on the border, either cavalry or infantry, under
                                    the present state of things, predicted on the idea that Kentucky
                                    would remain loyal. I think the resolution will prevent an
                                    efficient organization of cavalry on the border, should the time
                                    come when such a course would be necessary.
                                Mr. NEWCOMB entered his protest against this continued
                                    disposition of fault finding with public officers. Although we
                                    are all military men here, the Governor can get better military
                                    advice than we can give him.
                                Mr. CRAVENS stated that this idea originated with no less a
                                    personage than Colonel Wood, of the United States army. A man
                                    who has seen twenty years service; and by the figures of that
                                    gentleman the cost of these eight companies would not be one
                                    dollar more than $325,000 per annum. If the security should only
                                    extend to the telegraph and rail-road lines it would be worth
                                    the money. Senators say that now there is no necessity for this
                                    protection ; but the contrary is the case. To-day there is more
                                    necessity for this force than there ever was before. There are
                                    now in this city delegations from counties asking for men - the
                                    same counties that sent delegates in the early part of this
                                    session protesting against the idea of sending them troops. We
                                    called out six regiments and now we have but two. There is no
                                    necessity for referring this resolution to any committee.
                                    Senators can vote upon it now as well as at any other time.
                                Mr. STUDABAKER withdrew his motion to re-commit.
                                The joint resolution was then rejected by yeas 17, nays 24 - as
                                    follows:

                                Mr. MURRAY. Mr. President - I ask to be excused from attendance
                                    on this body for the balance of the session. I have just
                                    received intelligence from Camp Morton that the regiment to
                                    which I am attached has orders to start to Washington
                                    immediately.

                                The PRESIDENT. The Senator has leave of absence.
                            
                            
                                THE SALARIES OF PUBLIC OFFICERS.
                                Mr. Johnston's officer's salary bill, [S. No. 23,] -see page 135
                                    of these Reports - coming up in regular order, it was read the
                                    third time.
                                Mr. JOHNSTON. The only change in the law is in reference to the
                                    time of payment. The salaries are neither increased nor
                                    diminished. The time of payment is changed from quarterly to
                                    monthly. I suppose it is desired by many of the officers to have
                                    it changed.
                                The bill was rejected by yeas 22, nays 17.

                            Mr. McCLEAN presented the remonstrance of the Mayor of Terre Haute
                                and a number of the people of Vigo county, against the abolition of
                                the Common Pleas Court: which was referred to the Committee
                                    on the Organization of the Courts of Justice.

                            On motion by Mr. BUNDY, it was laid on the table.
                            Mr. BUNDY, from the Judiciary Committe, (the order
                                of business having been suspended for the purpose,) returned his
                                Treasurers' fee bill (54)
                                without amendment, and with a recommendation that the same ought to
                                pass.
                            Mr. DAVIS. What was to be accomplished by this bill?
                            Mr. BUNDY. The fees are the same till you reach $5,000. Then we
                                reduce the fees to three per cent, between $5.000 and $15,000, and
                                to two per cent, between $15,000 and $25,000, and to one per cent,
                                on all sums over $25,000. The reduction is the difference between
                                one per cent, and three per cent, on large revenues. On small
                                revenues there is no reduction.
                            Mr. ORR had no doubt that heavy revenues could be collected even
                                cheaper than the bill proposes.
                            Mr. CASON. I propose to recommit the bill, with instructions to
                                reduce the fees of the County Auditor and County Clerk twenty per
                                cent., as near as may be. He said: It seems to me, that by this bill
                                we are endeavoring to reduce the fees of a class of officers, with
                                respect to who, if we look the State over, we shall find that a
                                majority of them do not receive any more than a fair compensation.
                                The duties of the County Treasurer are onerous and responsible; and
                                in disturbed times like the present, when he is more than ordinarily
                                liable to have it robbed - taking these things into consideration,
                                it seems to me that we are making a tilt at an officer that should
                                be the last to be disturbed. Then the delinquent list must be larger
                                in these times. But you only have to look at the County Auditors and
                                County Clerks, to be convinced that they are the most profitable
                                offices in the county. A man could not enter court without very
                                heavy Clerk fees - much more than the labor is worth. You can't
                                settle a decedent's estate without paying $30 for Clerk's fees. The
                                body had just reduced the Treasurer's fees for collecting the
                                delinquent list from 8 to 5 per cent. He spoke at length.
                            Mr. BUNDY said this speech of the gentleman from Boone and Hendricks
                                had come up to the programme of which we gave notice the other day.
                                The object was to strangle and destroy the bill. The bill was
                                brought in in accordance with a general desire of the
                                members. The same bill met with the favor of the House at the last
                                session. Where the County Auditor received no more than the law
                                allows, he was the poorest paid officer in the county. He repeated
                                that the Treasurer's office was far the best paying office; and it
                                would be better as we increased the taxes. We assessed fifteen cents
                                on the $100 at the regular session, and five cents at this session.
                                On his motion, the proposition to amend was laid on the table.
                            Mr. NEBEKER submitted some considerations in figures against the
                                bill. He saw not why the treasurer should be singled out at this
                                time for a reduction of fees.
                            Mr. RAGAN. If the bill reduced the per cent, from the first thousand
                                dollars, he might look upon it with more favor. He wanted to pay the
                                    the treasurer in proportion to the labor he
                                performed. There was no inducement in the bill to collect the
                                delinquent taxes. We had already cut down the treasurer's fees in
                                the disbursement of the school fund. A banker in his region had
                                declared that he would not give the bond of the county treasurer for
                                the compensation he gets. We ought to pay, so that we may secure
                                competent and reliable men for these places.
                            Mr. JENKINSON demanded the previous-question, and under its operation
                                the bill was considered as engrossed, and the final vote was

                            REDEMPTION BILL.
                            Mr. VEATCH, from the Judiciary Committee, returned
                                Mr. Stotsenberg's redemption bill, [28] with an amendment striking out all after the enacting
                                clause, and inserting four sections. [It provides that whenever
                                hereafter real estate shall be sold on general execution, decree,
                                &c., the owner may redeem it at any time within one year from
                                sale, by paying the purchase money with interest thereon at the rate
                                of 8 per cent. per annum. On the payment of the purchase money, the
                                sheriff shall issue to the purchaser his certificate of purchase,
                                which shall entitle the holder to a deed of conveyance at the end of
                                one year, if the property shall not have been redeemed. It provides
                                also for redemption on the part of junior creditors.]
                            Mr. VEATCH. The question was raised when the bill was recommitted, as
                                to its constitutionality - whether it was intended to apply to
                                contracts. That matter was fully discussed before the committee, and
                                the opinion, he believed, was unanimous that this bill disturbs no
                                contract. It simply provides regulations under which the purchaser
                                shall buy. Then it provides that the purchaser shall not have a deed
                                for one year. Any time within the year the owner may come in and
                                redeem. And it gives the same advantage to junior creditors,
                                &c.
                            Mr. BUNDY proposed to concur in the amendment of the committee, with
                                an amendment adding appropriately these words: Provided, however, that the provisions of this bill shall
                                not apply to any judgment rendered, or contract made prior to the
                                time of the passage of this act.
                            Mr. BUNDY. Where a contract is made under laws, the laws themselves
                                were in some sense apart of the contract: so that all such laws as
                                this, affecting the system of collection, were more or less opposed
                                to the constitutional inhibition about laws impairing the
                                obligations of contracts. He was willing, however, to take the vote
                                with his amendment.
                            Mr. VEATCH replied to the constitutional exception. The bill did not
                                disturb the contract or the remedy under it. The purchaser is a new
                                party; and you have a right to legislate so as to bind all future
                                purchasers. His opinion was corroborated by that of the Attorney
                                General. He could not see what was to be gained by the amendment of
                                the gentleman from Henry. From the direction of the questions put by
                                gentlemen objecting here, it would seem that they must hold, that,
                                because the Sheriff serves the execution, therefore the Legislature
                                can not abolish the Sheriff's office, and place the business in the
                                hands of a Master Commissioner, etc. When he had concluded, he moved
                                to lay the amendment on the table.
                            Mr. BUNDY demanded the yeas and nays, and the vote was reported -
                                yeas 73, nays 10 - as follows:

                            So the bill amendments were concurred in.
                            Mr. GRESHAM. The only material change proposed by the committee is
                                the relief to the execution debtor. If the debtor's property is in a
                                condition to sell for three fourths its value, it will probably be
                                as well for him, as for him to make the money in any other way. Then
                                again, what relief is it to the younger creditor? He has a right to
                                attend the sale and bid on the property sold. But here is another
                                objection. We are going to inaugurate a new system of collection
                                altogether a new system - and which can not fail to become a
                                fruitful source of litigation. Questions will continually be rising
                                about the right of redemption. In the first place, I don't think
                                there is any great relief in it, to the execution-debtor; and as far
                                as it extends relief to other parties, it is similar to the New York
                                redemption law; and as for that law, in the State of New York, where
                                the people were used to it, it was still regarded as a great source
                                of litigation.
                            Mr. EDSON held a different opinion as to the relief proposed to the
                                execution debtor as well as to junior iniumbrancers. He reviewed the
                                case at length. He showed also how this relief would compel property
                                to sell something near its value to prevent the probabilities of
                                redemption.
                            Mr. GRESHAM. Will not this bill, if it pass, virtually amount to a
                                suspension of the laws for the collection of debts?
                            Mr. EDSON. No, I think not.
                            Mr. GRESHAM. It should be recollected that there are some creditors
                                who are also embarrassed, and if you prevent them from collecting,
                                where is the relief?
                            Mr EDSON. I understand that this bill is for the benefit of the poor
                                man, and not the Shylock. I do not know how it is in other portions
                                of the State, but in our county real estate will not bring one-filth
                                its valuation on the tax duplicate; and when it is sold under
                                execution, in almost all cases it is purchased by the creditor. I
                                have seen a house and lot in our town, which, one year ago, sold for
                                $1,600, sell for $460 under execution. Now, I say justice and equity
                                should give that man the right to come in and redeem that property.
                                It should not be the policy of legislation to foster large land
                                monopolists. It is not because men have not property enough to pay
                                their debts, that they are embarrassed, but because they can't
                                command the actual cash.
                            Mr. JENKINSON proposed to amend the bill by striking out "eight'' and
                                inserting "ten" per cent. interest.
                            Mr. CRAIN. I am in favor of that, and if it is added I will go for
                                the bill. If it is any relief I am willing to grant it. It will not
                                affect the State credit. It does not operate on past contracts and
                                considerations. It only operates on  the purchaser. The reason why I am in
                                favor of 10 per cent. is, that that is as low as money
                                can be got in any portion of the State. Then it is doing what is
                                right toward the purchaser. I know 10 per cent, is not the legal
                                interest; but I am speaking of what money brings. I can conceive of
                                many instances in which this bill might be of great benefit to
                                parties. Property might sell at very low figures through collusions,
                                and if the debtor can have time to get breath he may redeem his
                                property. It is well to throw around him a set of circumstances by
                                which he can recover and pay up. I have opposed all the relief
                                measures but this, and I am willing to vote for this if it shall
                                give a fair remuneration to the purchaser for the use of his
                                money.
                            Mr. ROBBINS demanded the previous question and under its operation
                                Mr. Jenkinson's amendment was adopted.
                            And then the bill was ordered to be engrossed and considered as
                                engrossed. The vote on the final reading was reported yeas 78, nays

                            Mr. ATKISSON (pro forma.) I could have willingly
                                voted for this bill if the amendment of the gentleman from Henry
                                (Mr. Bundy) had prevailed. But in its present shape I am satisfied
                                that it conflicts with the Constitution and will cause litigation. I
                                would vote for any constitutional measure of relief.
                            So the bill passed the House of Representatives.
                        
                        
                            FARMER'S LIEN BILL.
                            Mr. EDSON, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                returned the landlord lien bill [S. 30] without amendment, and with
                                a recommendation for its passage.
                            He explained why the amendment of Mr. Stotsenburg was not
                                incorporated. That was a revival of the law of Landlord and tenant,
                                and is not germain to the matter of this bill. He repeated that
                                there had not been a bill before this or the regular session in
                                which his constituents had a deeper interest. It provides that the
                                land owner shall have a lien not on the personal property of the
                                tenant but upon the crops growing and grown upon the land. He
                                supported the bill as founded in justice, and as a measure of
                                advantage also to the tenant, because it affords a just security for
                                rent to the landlord. Under this bill, men of small means, (as the
                                title reads,) men unable to give personal security, would be able to
                                rent land, and so provide themselves with homes. It was distinctly a
                                law for the benefit of the poor man.
                            Mr. GRESHAM. Are not the landholders asking for it?
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Is it not for the benefit of the large landholders?
                            Mr. EDSON. No. It was demanded by all. While it would confer a
                                benefit on the renter, it would confer a still greater benefit upon
                                the tenant. He referred to the expense to tenants of executing the
                                writings necessary for them to give personal security by mortgage,
                                &c., which would be obviated by this bill. This bill would
                                elevate day-laborers to the much better condition of the tenant. The
                                non-execution of these mortgages might deprive a few lawyers of
                                their fees for drawing them. This bill had passed five times in one
                                branch or other of this Legislature since the repeal of the law of
                                1852. He discussed the doctrine of liens.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. What more right have you, legal or moral, because you
                                own a few thousand acres of land, to say to your tenant, "you shall
                                pay me first," than that man has who furnished the tenant with the
                                means of supporting his family while he made the crop?
                            Mr. ROBBINS. Or suppose the case of a man who has furnished your
                                tenant with subsistence prior to the time when he became your
                                tenant?
                            Mr. EDSON. How was a man to make a crop, and to make money to pay his
                                debts, unless he can rent land. He then resumed the doctrine of
                                liens. Your hotel keeper has a lien upon your trunk till your board
                                bill is paid. Why should the mechanic have a lien on the house he
                                has built? or why should the mechanic or furnisher of steamboats or
                                railroads have a lien for their labor or goods, and the farmer be
                                left without a lien on what his own land has produced, to secure his
                                rent? Would the House drive men from farming, and compel them to go
                                into the army, or elsewhere, for a livelihood.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. What interest has the McClure estate in this bill?
                            Mr. EDSON. Not a cent. Your county and almost every county in the
                                State, has a part of that estate in working men's libraries. He
                                supported the bill from further considerations.
                            Mr. GRESHAM proposed to concur, with an amendment, giving a like lien
                                on the personal property of the tenant, to the person who shall
                                credit him for food, clothing, &c.
                            The gentlemen seemed to be wishing to benefit the poor man, by taking
                                from him the benefit of appraisement laws. Now, the tenant could not
                                cultivate the land he rents without food, clothing and implements,
                                for which, meanwhile, he is obliged to be indebted to some little
                                country storekeeper near by. He considered the bill would be perfect
                                with his i amendment, and it was supported by nearly  all the considerations which the
                                gentleman had so carefully presented.
                            Mr. ORR proposed to concur, with an amendment, restricting the lien,
                                "when the landlord rents for a portion of the crop, upon that
                                portion or amount he is to get for rent, and upon no other
                                portion."
                            Mr. HEFFREN moved the indefinite postponement of the bill and
                                amendments, which, being pressed under the previous question, was
                                rejected - yeas 40, nays 40.
                            The question recurred on the amendment of Mr. Gresham.
                            Mr. PROSSER moved to lay it on the table.
                            Mr. EDSON demanded the yeas and nays, and the motion prevailed, by
                                yeas 52, nays 27.
                            The question then recurred on Mr. Orr's amendment.
                            Mr. WOODHULL moved to postpone the further consideration of the
                                subject till to-morrow.
                            Mr. HEFFREN preferred a direct vote. He moved to lay the motion to
                                postpone on the table.
                            The latter motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. LANE demanded the previous question, and, under its pressure, Mr.
                                Orr's amendment was adopted - affirmative 45, negative 35.
                            On motion by Mr. EDSON, the bill was ordered to be read the third
                                time now.
                            It being read through by the Clerk -
                            Mr. WOODS moved to recommit with the following instructions, which
                                were read for information.
                            Amend by inserting in the proper place, as an additional section,
                                these words: "All amounts due for labor on such land, that may have
                                been employed for the purpose of raising such crop, shall have
                                precedence in payment, and shall be fully satisfied and paid in
                                full. If not so paid, such person or persons having such claims for
                                such labor performed shall have a lien on such crops till such debt
                                for labor is satisfied."
                            Mr. DAVIS and Mr. HENRICKS submitted the following, which was read
                                for the information of the House.
                            Amend by inserting, in the proper place, "that when any owner of land
                                shall rent any, part thereof to any poor man, the poor man shall
                                have a lien on said land for all damages the poor man shall incur,
                                provided the said land does not yield the said poor man a good crop,
                                he having properly cultivated the same."
                            But they were excluded by the force of the question, and the vote on
                                the final passage of the bill was taken and reported - yeas 30, nays

                            ADDITIONAL GENERAL APPROPRIATIONS.
                            Mr. FISHER, under instructions from the Committee on Ways
                                    and Means, reported a bill [60] entitled An act making
                                additional general appropriations for the years 1861 and 1862; and
                                defining the fund out of which they are to be paid-and providing for
                                a committee to audit claims upon said appropriations, and providing
                                for the expenses thereof; and, under a dispensation of the rules, it
                                was passed the first and second readings.
                            [It appropriates $1,000,000: $3,000 for German translations and
                                printing, $15,000 for the Legislative expenses, $1,000 for
                                incidentals in the Adjutant General's office. It appoints an
                                Auditing Committee to consist of two members of the House of
                                Representatives and one of the Senate, to audit the accounts of the
                                Commissary and Quartermaster General, and all other claims to be
                                paid out of this million appropriation - said committee shall sit
                                once a month; have power to employ a clerk, receive $3 per diem
                                compensation, and five cents per mile mileage. The 8th section
                                amongst other appropriations incidental to executive and legislative
                                departments, has $3,000 for binding the laws, journals and Brevier
                                Reports, with a provision that the laws of the regular session and
                                the present session shall be bound in one volume.]
                            The House took a recess till two o'clock p. m.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            On motion by Mr. FISHER, the House proceeded with the consideration
                                of his additional million general appropriation bill [60] and it was again read
                                through by the Clerk.
                            Mr. DAVIS. I do not understand that this additional million is to be
                                borrowed.
                            Mr. FISHER. These are appropriations to be paid out of the former
                                loan.
                            Mr. BLACK. I propose to amend by striking out, all that part which
                                provides for an auditing committee. I cannot see the use of this
                                committee, so long as we have an Auditor of State.
                            Mr. FISHER. That question is one to which the committee gave a great
                                deal of attention. While our people are perfectly willing to pay all
                                the taxes necessary to support the government, they undoubtedly look
                                to the Legislature to provide such guards as shall prevent their
                                money from being squandered. The Auditor is ordinarily the
                                accounting officer of the State, but it should be borne in mind that
                                that officer's labors are now greatly increased. He is required to
                                sign all the bonds of the State; that is a single circumstance.
                                There are 88,000 separate bonds of the State to be issued, which
                                will require 88,000 signatures, which that officer will have to
                                make; and for that labor alone, at 2,000 signatures a day, it ill
                                require all his time for 44 days. The result must be, then, that he
                                cannot pay due at-  tention to
                                the other duties of his office during that period of 44 days. The
                                question, then, is this: whether he shall have a clerk to do this
                                auditing of the claims to be paid out of this appropriation, or
                                whether the House shall appoint this committee? The Auditor of
                                Public Recounts cannot give that attention to the subject which it
                                absolutely requires. There is such a thing as overloading him with
                                business so that he can do nothing personally, but only overlook
                                what is done by others; and when you reduce him to that, all your
                                assurance of faithfulness and fidelity in his office is gone. He may
                                appoint good men or bad men; and collusions may take place among his
                                appointees and parties having claims against the State. We know
                                there would be a great chance of perpetrating frauds in this way. I,
                                for one, think this way: that, while we are here appropriating the
                                people's money for purposes which they approve, they will also hold
                                us to a strict accountability for the duty of providing all the
                                guards we can to prevent it from being squandered. After various
                                consultations in committee, we have come to the conclusion that this
                                is the best plan which we propose in this bill. The only object is
                                to secure the Treasury from being plundered, if I should use that
                                expression.
                            Mr. ATKINSON. Does the bill propose that the Governor shall appoint
                                this committee?
                            Mr. FISHER. No sir; it is a committee of two from the House and one
                                from the Senate. There is another advantage in this plan. The whole
                                thing is kept within the control of the Legislature. The Legislature
                                is selected by the people. We are appropriating the people's money,
                                and it becomes our duty to throw proper guards around it. We are
                                held responsible for the results, whether we keep the power in our
                                own hands, or transfer it, to that of others, we will be held
                                responsible, let us expend this money in whatever manner we may. The
                                expense of this committee I can not estimate. It will take time to
                                get into working order. Their business may require them to remain
                                here a week or more in every month; but when the working of the
                                machinery comes to be understood, I think four days in a month will
                                be sufficient. People will soon learn the time when their claims can
                                be passed upon, and be ready. But suppose it were necessary for that
                                committee to sit here every day from this till January; if you
                                constitute the committee of the right kind of men, I think the money
                                for their per diem would be well laid out. I think, if the whole
                                time of the committee should be occupied, considering the magnitude
                                of the interests involved, their pay would be money well expended
                                for the State. In making these remarks, I am. by no means impugning
                                the reputation of the officers of State properly charged with these
                                matters, but I am only looking to the large amount of business they
                                have to perform.
                            Mr. McLEAN was rather inclined, at first, to oppose this proposition
                                for an auditing committee, but he was satisfied the Auditor could
                                not give the necessary attention to everything under these war
                                appropriations. Early in the session, the House passed a bill
                                authorizing commissioners to have oversight of the war
                                disbursements; but that bill had met with no favor in the Senate;
                                and it was necessary that the State should have some competent
                                agency to do the work which those commissioners were to do.
                            Mr. BLACK saw a difficulty in the fact that this committee could not
                                be in session all the time here, and claimants would be at a loss to
                                know when to present their claims.
                            Mr. CRAIN considered that the Legislature should supervise these
                                large disbursements. A million, seven hundred thousand dollars would
                                be appropriated by the Legislature, if this bill pass. Other States
                                had taken the same course. He had expected gentlemen would suggest
                                further guards, instead of efforts to take away what guards we have,
                                by amendments such as that offered by the gentleman from Orange.
                            Mr. RAGAN feared that, perhaps, this bill would open a door to dodge
                                the embezzlement bill. Then it was not right to assume that all the
                                honesty in the State is lodged in the Legislature. He preferred the
                                sworn State officers, and reliance on their oath and their bonds, as
                                the safest guards and guarantees of fidelity in these disbursements.
                                He was opposed to interference with the duties of the State
                                officers.
                            Mr. FISHER. The main reason why the committee regarded this measure
                                as necessary is in the fact which I stated before, that it is
                                utterly impossible for the Auditor of Public Accounts to attend to
                                these duties personally, and also to the large amount of other
                                business he has to do. I stated that the mere signing of the State
                                bonds, required by the loan bill, will require 44 days of incessant
                                labor. And during this time, I take it, if the Auditor have other
                                public duties to perform, he must do the work by proxy. The
                                gentleman from Putnam makes the intimation that the embezzlement
                                bill will not operate as a check on this committee. In reply, I
                                would say to him, that this committee have no control whatever over
                                the public money. They simply examine and certify that such and such
                                accounts and claims are just. Now, if the Auditor audits a claim for
                                a thousand dollars more than it ought to be, the embezzlement bill
                                can do no good in such a case. That bill applies only where he
                                diverts the public money from its proper channel, or appropriates it
                                to his own use. Somebody must do this work; and the question is,
                                whether it shall be done by a committee or by clerks appointed by
                                the Auditor. Assuredly this Legislature will be held responsible for
                                the security of this money and the fidelity of its disbursement.
                                Whether this is the best plan or not is for this House to determine.
                                If any gentleman can devise a better plan, I  should be glad to have him present it.
                                I hope the House will not think of throwing this labor on the
                                shoulders of the Auditor, who, I am persuaded, never can do it
                                properly, and never will be willing to undertake it.
                            Mr. PARRETT. Will this committee have authority to take
                                testimony?
                            Mr. FISHER. Their power is not limited as to that. But the Auditor is
                                expressly prohibited from paying out any claim not audited by them.
                                I do not think they would have power to send for persons and papers.
                                But they will have to examine claims; and its power to reject
                                implies the examination of vouchers and the hearing of such
                                testimony as may be brought before them. If the claimant does not
                                bring up his evidence to their satisfaction they will reject his
                                claim.
                            Mr. McLEAN. An individual with a large claim would be very likely to
                                bring in his witnesses.
                            Mr. PARRETT. Will it not be the duty of the committee to send for
                                rebutting testimony?
                            Mr. FISHER. I do not think the bill makes any provision of authority
                                to send for persons and papers, which would incur expense. There is
                                no such thing in the bill.
                            Mr. PARRFTT. Then all the committee have to do is to correct accounts
                                as they are handed over to them, and either reject or admit.
                            Mr. FISHER. It will be necessary to compare the claims with the
                                contract and vouchers.
                            Mr. BUNDY. The gentleman from Vigo [Mr. McLean] has made my speech;
                                and now with the view of testing the sense of the House on the
                                amendment, I move to lay it on the table.
                            The motion was agreed to, and the question recurred on the
                                engrossment.
                            Mr. BRETT. I believe that, as our war matters now stand, there is an
                                Inspector General, under whose eye and inspection every claim has to
                                pass before it goes to the Auditor; and, without his endorsement, no
                                claim can be paid. Mr. Miles Murphy is our Inspector General, and I
                                do not see any necessity for an additional board of inspectors.
                            Mr. FISHER. Where does the gentleman find authority for such an
                                officer?
                            Mr. BRETT. In the army regulations, I suppose.
                            Mr. PARRETT. The Inspector General swears that the duty which this
                                bill gives to the committee is his duty.
                            Mr. FISHER. I do not understand that there is any such an officer
                                authorized by the laws of the State of Indiana.
                            Mr. McLEAN. If I understand it, it is the duty of the Inspector
                                General to inspect the arms, ammunition, clothing and supplies of
                                the men. His duty does not extend to the inspection of accounts.
                            Mr. BRETT. Has he not been attending to that?
                            Mr. PARRETT. The gentleman from Vigo and the Inspector General
                                understand the duties of that officer differently. There is a
                                difference of opinion between military men. [Laughter.]
                            Mr. FISHER. This duty of the Inspector General has been devolved upon
                                him without authority of law. There has been a necessity for
                                somebody to pass upon these accounts, but the law does not devolve
                                any such duty upon him. In the absence of the ability of the Auditor
                                to attend to it, I understand from the Governor, that this officer
                                has been detailed for this work.
                            Mr. BRETT. It does seem to me that this thing might be managed
                                without bringing these three members of the Legislature here once a
                                month to attend to it. If the Auditor of State needs additional help
                                let him have it. The gentleman from Wabash says it will require this
                                committee but three or four days once a month; and if that is all we
                                might allow the Auditor additional clerk hire to attend to the
                                matter properly in the proper place. I believe one good clerk would
                                do as well as half a dozen committees. Therefore I think this
                                proposition entirely uncalled for; and I move a reconsideration of
                                the vote by which that portion of the act has been passed.
                            Mr. HOLCOMB. I move to recommit the bill with instructions to report
                                an amendment authorizing the Auditor to employ a clerk.
                            The SPEAKER. The question is on the motion of 'he gentleman from
                                Henry to lay the amendment on the table.
                            Mr. BLACK demanded the yeas and nays, and they were ordered and taken
                                - yeas 40, nays 43.
                            So the House refused to lay the amendment on the table.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN. (Mr. Orr in the Chair.) There is one argument
                                which has not yet been used, and which is conclusive to my mind why
                                the amendment should not prevail. I can see no good reason why the
                                House should not throw around the disbursement of this money all the
                                safe-guards in its power. There is another reason, perfectly
                                conclusive, why this commission should be appointed. These
                                appropriations are made under extraordinary circumstances. They are
                                made with the expectation that a large portion will eventually be
                                refunded to the State by the General Government. And, if we expect
                                this money to be refunded, it is incumbent upon us to have
                                everything connected with it so certified that when we will come to
                                present our claim there will be no further proof needed. While I
                                accord to the Auditor of State credit for as much honesty as any
                                man, yet, sir, 1 feel desirous that inasmuch as we are to be held
                                responsible for these appropriations, and inasmuch as we expect them
                                to be reimbursed, we should control them as far as possible. But
                                gentlemen  object because an
                                additional expense is to be incurred. Now suppose this committee
                                should be in session from the day of the adjournment of this
                                Legislature up to the time when the last dollar of these
                                appropriations shall have been expended, would the expense be any
                                greater than the amount gentlemen are wiling to give for clerk hire.
                                The whole amount would not much exceed $3,000. How can gentlemen
                                object to that, when the object is to watch the disbursement of a
                                million of dollars, under circumstances where frauds may be
                                perpetrated, unless the most watchful care is exercised. This is no
                                new thing, Mr. Speaker. Every State that has sent forces into the
                                field has provided that the expenses incurred shall be audited by a
                                committee similar to that provided by this bill. The only difference
                                between the State of Indiana and the other States is, that while we
                                make this provision in the general appropriation bill they do the
                                same thing by a special law,except in the State of Massachusetts,
                                where the Governor's Council take care of the matter. Sir, is not
                                the amount of money involved, and is not the circumstances under
                                which it is to be expended a sufficient justification for every
                                protection and safe-guard that we can possibly throw around this
                                fund? I do not agree with my friend from Wabash, that this work can
                                be done in three or four days of each month. My opinion is, that
                                full half the time of this committee will be occupied in auditing
                                these claims. And this fact itself shows the necessity of a
                                commission to take care of this fund, whose duty shall be confined
                                to that single purpose. Mr. Speaker, I ask if it is the purpose of
                                the friends of this amendment to allow these claims to be audited by
                                a clerk to be furnished by the Auditor? That, I understand, to be
                                about the substance of the proposition of gentlemen who favor
                                striking out. They say, give to the Auditor an additional clerk and
                                the expense will not be so great. Then it is the clerk and not the
                                Auditor that is to make these investigations. We have been told by
                                the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means
                                that, for the next two months, the whole time of the Auditor will be
                                occupied in signing the State bonds. That he cannot do by deputy.
                                Then the Auditor can give no part of these two months to the
                                investigation of these claims; and, sir, I do not care who or how
                                honest that Auditor's clerk may be, there is no clerk in the State
                                of Indiana into whose hands I would be willing to commit the
                                investigation 01 these claims.
                            Mr. JENKINSON was convinced by the remarks of the gentleman from
                                Knox, of the wisdom and propriety of putting this commission in the
                                bill.
                            Mr. FRAZIER was opposed to the motion to strike out. But if this
                                committee have not the power to send for testimony, I think they
                                ought to have that power. - Mr. Black's amendment was rejected.
                            Mr. RAGAN proposed to amend by inserting in the proper place the
                                names of Stearns, Fisher and John S. Hopkins.
                            Mr. FISHER and Mr. HOPKINS desired the gentleman from Putnam to
                                withdraw the amendment.
                            Mr. BUNDY thought it better to allow the committee to be appointed by
                                the proper authority.
                            Mr. PACKARD proposed the name of A. M. Black for one of the
                                committee.
                            Mr. RAGAN accepted.
                            Mr. FISHER proposed the name of David S. Branham.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN suggested that if it was desirable to have the
                                committee selected by the House, let it, be done by ballot. This
                                course would gain time for the consideration of the details of the
                                bill.
                            Mr. BUNDY moved to lay Mr. Ragan's amendment, as amended, on the
                                table.
                            Mr. PACKARD demanded the yeas and nays and the vote stood - yeas 42.
                                nays 41; so the amendment was laid on the table.
                            Mr. FISHER. There should be in the bill an exception of the claims of
                                members and officers of the present General Assembly. He proposed
                                that amendment in form, and it was adopted by unanimous consent, in
                                these words: "except for legislative expenses."
                            The bill was'now ordered to be considered as engrossed, and it was
                                again read through by the Clerk, as amended.
                            Mr. HOLCOMB asked unanimous consent to fix the salary of the
                                Committee Clerk at $800 a year.
                            Mr. FISHER supposed it would not be necessary to employ a clerk all
                                the time.
                            Mr. BUNDY objected to the amendment.
                            The vote on the third and last reading of the bill was reported -
                                yeas 73, nays 12 - as follows:

                                SALARY OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN introduced a bill [61] to increase the salary
                                    of the Attorney General, and providing for the payment thereof.
                                    [It makes his salary $2,500, (instead of $1,000) payable
                                    quarter-yearly.]
                                The bill was read twice, (under a dispensation for the purpose,)
                                    and referred to the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG introduced a bill [62] providing for the
                                    impeachment of witnesses in certain cases.
                                
                                It was passed to the second reading to-morrow.
                                Mr. GRESHAM introduced a bill [63] supplemental to the militia
                                    act of May 11, 1861, which was passed the first reading. He
                                    said: The militia bill [sec. 10] provided originally for a major
                                    to each battalion, and when it was amended so as to provide for
                                    one major to each regiment, there was left the discrepancy of
                                    provisions that the regimental staff officers shall be appointed
                                    both by the colonel and the major. The bill, of course, gives
                                    this power to the Colonel.
                                On motion of Mr. GRESHAM, (under a dispensation) it was passed
                                    the second reading.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON proposed to amend by adding a provision "for a tax
                                    of 50 cents a year on every person liable to military duty, that
                                    shall fail or refuse to enrol himself with the active militia of
                                    the State."
                                On motion of Mr. McLEAN, the amendment was laid on the table.
                                The bill was then considered as engrossed, and passed the third
                                    and last reading in the House of Representatives - yeas 70, nays

                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            WEDNESDAY, May 29, 1861.
                        
                        On motion by Mr. COBB, the regular order of business was passed over, and
                            the Senate proceeded to the consideration of bills on their third
                            reading.
                        
                            SCHOLARSHIPS IN THE STATE UNIVERSITY.
                            Mr. Tarkington's University scholarship bill, S. No. 34, coming up, it was read the
                                third time.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON. I think the bill passed the Senate last session
                                without opposition. It went to the House and failed on the third
                                reading for want of time.
                            The roll was called on the passage of the bill, but no quorum voting
                                -
                            On motion by Mr. CONLEY, a call of the Senate was ordered.
                            The Secretary reported thirty-four Senators, (a quorum,) present and
                                answering to their names, but the Senate immediately being without a
                                quorum again -
                            On motion by Mr. CONLEY, the absentees were sent for.
                            Pending which -
                            The PRESIDENT laid before the Senate the following communication in
                                reply to Mr. Slack's resolution of yesterday:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Hon. Sen. John R. Cravens, President of
                                                the Senate:
                                        
                                        SIR: In reply to the resolution of the Senate making
                                            inquiry as to the progress made, the length of time
                                            consumed and the number of persons employed, by the
                                            committee appointed at the last meeting of the Senate
                                            for the investigation of swamp land frauds, the
                                            undersigned would respectfully state -
                                        1. That but little progress has been made by the
                                            committee in the contemplated investigation, for the
                                            reason that the time which elapsed between the last
                                            regular session of the Legislature and the present
                                            special session was not longer than was necessary for a
                                            proper arrangement of the private affairs of the members
                                            of the committee, preparatory to entering upon the
                                            investigation, being but little more than six weeks. The
                                            committee had appointed the third Monday of April last
                                            as the time for meeting at the Capital for the purpose
                                            of entering upon the investigation, but the call of the
                                            Governor for a special session was made for the
                                            Wednesday following, and in consequence the
                                            investigation could not be pursued - all the members of
                                            the Committee being members of the General Assembly.
                                        2. The committee have been engaged three days.
                                        3. No "persons" have been employed in "said service,"
                                            other than the members of the committee.
                                        It may be proper to state in conclusion, that the
                                            committee have fixed upon the first Monday of July next
                                            for the commencement of the investigation.
                                        
                                            All of which is respectfully submitted.
                                            JOHN F. MILLER,
                                            Chairman.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                            A quorum being present -
                            On motion by Mr. TARKINGTON further proceedings under the call was
                                dispensed with.
                            The bill then finally passed by yeas 41, nays 0.
                            Mr. SLACK moved that the communication above be referred to the
                                    Committee on Swamp Lands for the purpose of
                                inquiring into the expediency of reporting a resolution rescinding
                                the authority of that committee.
                            On motion by Mr. MELLETT - yeas 21, nays 19 - this motion was laid on
                                the table.
                        
                        
                            JOSEPH MOORE.
                            Mr. March's bill, S. No. 32,
                                for the relief of Joseph Moore, coming up it was read the third
                                time.
                            Mr. MARCH. This is a local bill. It simply provides for supplying a
                                defect in assigning a school certificate. It passed the Senate at
                                the last session.
                            The bill passed the Senate by yeas 40, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            RAILROADS.
                            Mr. Newcomb's bill, S. No. 33, to amend section 34 of the Railroad
                                act of May 11, 1852 was read the third time.
                            Mr. BLAIR. I hope this bill will pass. There is probably not more
                                than one road that will come under the provisions of this bill
                                (Indiana and Illinois Central.) It is nothing but right and proper
                                considering the circumstances by which we are surrounded, and the
                                impossibility of obtaining means to complete these roads.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS. The reason urged is to my mind an objection to the
                                bill. It is for the purpose of keeping these roads alive ten years
                                longer, to support two officers, to annoy the stockholders and make
                                them pay a tax for that purpose without there being a possibility of
                                ever completing the road.
                            The bill finally passed by yeas 30, nays 13.

                            Mr. DeHart's bill, S. No. 22,
                                coming up was read.
                            Mr. CRAVEN. I am not personally interested in that bill. Some of my
                                constituents are, however. Two years ago a bill was passed that gave
                                dissatisfaction to the people of the county of Grant. After that
                                time, however, owing to the passage of a new bill fixing the time of
                                holding the Courts of Common Pleas, they got their courts so
                                arranged that they are now satisfied. I shall, therefore, feel under
                                obligations to vote against this bill.
                            Mr. CONNER was excused from voting.
                            The bill then finally passed by yeas 37, nays 2.
                        
                        
                            DECEDENT ESTATES.
                            Mr. Miller's bill, S. 35 - see page 137 of these reports - was read
                                the third time.
                            Mr. MILLER. This is the same bill that passed the Senate at the last
                                session. It provides for making a record of title in cases where
                                real estate has been bought in by administrators, but failed in the
                                House for want of time. It is a bill that ought to be passed. As the
                                law now stands in cases where the administrator buys in real estate
                                there is no way prescribed by law to make out a record title.
                            The bill finally passed the Senate by yeas 39, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            DELINQUENT TAX LIST.
                            Mr. Shoemaker's bill S. No. 46, introduced Thursday, was read the third time.
                            Mr. SHOEMAKER. The only object of that bill and the only amendment
                                made to the law, is  simply to
                                dispense with one of the three copies of the delinquent tax list now
                                required to be made out; the one required to be sent up to the
                                Auditor of State's office. I can see no reason why this should not
                                be done.
                            The bill passed the third and last reading in the Senate by yeas 36,
                                nays 1.

                            Mr. Odell's bill S. No. 36,
                                was read the third time.
                            Mr. ODELL. That bill only changes one term in the year in the county
                                of Carroll, and one in the county of Tippecanoe. I have consulted
                                with the members from Tippecanoe county, and they all acquiesce in
                                the change. I ask the unanimous consent of th 9 Senate to make the
                                following amendment, (adding a clause authorizing publication in the
                                    Sentinel and Journal)
                            The amendment was agreed to by consent, and the bill passed by yeas
                                35, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            DELAY AND ITS PUNISHMENT.
                            Mr. Cobb's bill No. 37,
                                introduced Thursday, coming up, it was read the third time.
                            Mr. COBB. That bill is simply making it a felony for any person to
                                attach himself to any combination or class of men for the purpose of
                                committing a felony. We have now no law making it a felony for a man
                                to attach himself to an organization of this kind. It is short and I
                                suppose the Senate understand it.
                            The bill passed the third and last reading in the Senate by yeas 37,
                                nays 0.

                            Mr. Mellett's bill S. No. 38,
                                requiring these officers to execute an official bond, was read the
                                third time, and passed the Senate finally by yeas 38, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            DECEDENT ESTATES.
                            Mr. Claypool's bill S. No. 39, was read the third time.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. This is a bill introduced by myself at the last session
                                and passed by the Senate. The object of the bill is simply to
                                correct an error in the law of descents. Under the present law, in
                                the distribution, where children have been advanced various sums
                                during the life time of the husband, and after his death when the
                                distribution is about to be made, the widow takes into consideration
                                these advances made. This bill provides that the advances are only
                                to be taken into consideration in adjusting the equity between the
                                children. In many cases under the present law, the whole estate is
                                thus passed over to the widow. The bill, as amended, will simply
                                take cognizance of these advances as between the widow and heirs,
                                but as between the children it does take cognizance of these
                                advances, leaving the law as it was in 1843.
                            The bill passed the final reading in the Senate by yeas 37, nays
                                1.
                        
                        
                            THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
                            Mr. Claypool's bill, S. No. 40, was read the third time.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. This bill, introduced by me, also passed the Senate
                                last session, but failed in the House for want of time. It was
                                drafted at the instance of Judge Perkins and some members of the bar
                                of the Supreme Court. I am informed that it is the practice to
                                appoint an Attorney General in all State cases, allowing a fee of
                                $10 in each case. This bill makes it the duty of the Attorney
                                General, receiving as he does a salary to appear in all State cases
                                in the Supreme Court and allows him, where a case is decided against
                                a party, to take a fee of $5, to be collected from the party in the
                                court below; no part of the fee to be paid out of the State
                                Treasury. It simply declares the duty of the Attorney General. The
                                passage of this bill will save to the State perhans $2,000 a
                                year.
                            The bill passed the final reading in the Senate by yeas 36, nays
                                2.

                            Mr. Conner's bill, S. No. 44, coming up, on his motion it was laid on
                                the table for the present, there being a House bill which may
                                possibly obviate the necessity of this one.
                        
                        
                            THE COMMON SCHOOL LAW.
                            On motion by Mr. TARKINGTON, the vote of yesterday by which the bill
                                H. R. 24 was ordered to be
                                engrossed for the third reading, was reconsidered and the bill
                                recommitted to the Committee on Education.
                        
                        
                            PARTITION OF LANDS, ETC.
                            Mr. March's bill, S. 48, was read the third time.
                            Mr. MARCH. This bill is intended to avoid difficulty in cases under
                                proceedings in partition. As the law now is, no appeal can be taken
                                until the final deed is made, and then it does no good. This bill
                                provides that an appeal may be taken at any time after the sale is
                                ordered and confirmed by the court.
                            The bill finally passed the Senate by yeas 30, nays 1.
                        
                        
                            SALE OF SCHOOL LANDS.
                            Mr. BEESON. This bill simply amends the two sections of the act named
                                [sections 54 and 56 of the school law of March 11, 1851.] They were
                                copied from an old law passed a number of years ago, when the
                                Legislature thought it was necessary to insert a number of votes
                                above which it was necessary to have in order to authorize school
                                land to be sold it required a majority of inhabitants, and provided
                                it should not exceed 15. In our county we have a fractional school
                                section that never has had and never will have that number of
                                inhabitants in it. They wish to sell school land belonging to them
                                in the county of Franklin; and in order to enable them to do it, we
                                simply desire to strike out of the law the number 15 as the number
                                required.
                            The bill finally passed the Senate by yeas 35, nays 1.

                            Mr. JOHNSTON. I move that the bill [S. No. 23] changing the time of
                                paying State officers, which failed yesterday afternoon, be taken up
                                and a recount had on its passage. The only change in the present law
                                is as I stated last night.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            The bill then finally passed the Senate by yeas 30, nays 13.

                        Vol. V.
                        INDIANAPOLIS, MAY 31, 1861.
                        NO. 14.
                    
                    
                        
                            THE TAX DUPLICATE.
                            Mr. SHOEMAKER'S bill [S. No. 50] coming up he said: A bill passed by
                                the House contains the same ground embraced in this bill, and I have
                                a favorable report from the Finance Committee thereon. I move to lay
                                the bill on the table and ask leave to make report to the
                                Senate.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. SHOEMAKER, from the Committee on Finance, then
                                made the following report:
                            Mr. President - The Committee on Finance, to which
                                was referred House bill No. 48, a bill to amend sections 75, 78, 79, 94, 95, 104, 142
                                and 163, of an act entitled an act to provide for the valuation and
                                assessment of the real and personal property, and the collection of
                                taxes in the State of Indiana, for the election of Township
                                Assesors, and prescribing the duties of assessors, appriaisers of
                                real property, County Treasurers and Auditors and of the Treasurer
                                and Auditor of State, approved June 21st, 1852, and to repeal an act
                                entitled an act to amend the 143d section of an act entitled an act
                                to provide for the valuation and assessment of the real and personal
                                property and the collection of taxes in the State of Indiana, for
                                the election of Township Assessors and prescribing the duties of
                                assessors, appraisers of real property, County Treasurers and
                                Auditors and of the Treasurer and Auditor of State, approved June
                                21st, 1852. Approved March 4th, 1859. Have had the same under
                                consideration and have directed me to report the same back and
                                recommend its passage.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS moved to consider the bill as engrossed, and read it the
                                third time now.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON spoke in opposition to several features in the bill,
                                and moved to strike out the first section thereof.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS could see no good to result from striking out that
                                section. By allowing it to remain a great expense would be saved,
                                and if there ever was a time when we want to curtail expenses and
                                labor it is now.
                            Mr. CARNAHAN moved that the bill and pending amendment be laid on the
                                table.
                        
                        
                            ADVANCE PAY TO VOLUNTEERS.
                            On motion by Mr. President CRAVENS, [Mr. March in the chair,] the
                                pending business was passed over informally and the joint resolution
                                [H. R. 11,] just reported from the House of Representatives,
                                authorizing advance pay to the three months' volunteers, was read
                                and passed the Senate by yeas 42, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            THE TAX DUPLICATE AGAIN.
                            Mr. COBB demanded a division of the question.
                            Mr. RAY. This bill has passed the ordeal of an examination of
                                competent ex-Auditors. The bill I suppose to be right as it is. I
                                shall therefore vote to lay the amendment on the table.
                            The Senate refused to lay the bill on the table by yeas 4, nays
                                34.
                            The amendment was laid on the table by yeas 30, nays 10.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON, from an experience of twelve years as a county
                                Auditor, declared the bill produced such a radical change that he
                                should have to vote against it. Why is it that we are not to know
                                how much corporation stock we are taxed with? He moved to amend by
                                striking out that part of the bill which does away with the column
                                in the duplicate wherein to state the value of corporation stock
                                taxed.
                            Mr. SLACK, with an experience of ten years as county Auditor, also
                                spoke against the provisions of the bill.
                            On motion by Mr. STUDABAKER, the bill and amendments were referred to
                                a select committee, which the Chair makes to consist of Messrs.
                                Studabaker, Shoemaker, Tarkington, Slack and Williams.
                        
                        
                            THE STATE LIBRARY.
                            Mr. March's bill, [S. No. 53,]
                                was read the third time.
                            Mr. MARCH. The object of this bill is to preserve the law library in
                                particular and the rest of the books in the library especially.
                            The bill passed the third and last reading in the Senate by yeas 40,
                                nays 0.
                        
                        
                            DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO ADMINISTER OATHS.
                            Mr. March's bill, S. N"o. 54, introduced Saturday, coming up, it was
                                read the third time.
                            Mr. MARCH. The bill has three objects. One is to allow the prosecutor
                                to swear witnesses and take the oath of a party to an affidavit when
                                he makes a charge. Another is when a person is examined before a
                                court, to ascertain whether it is necessary to issue a warrant for
                                the arrest of a criminal if the witness refuses to swear the officer
                                of court or justice of the peace may certify that it is a correct
                                statement, and that shall fill the object of the affidavit.
                            Mr. MILLER, rather than pass such a bill, would be in favor of
                                striking out of the Common Pleas system all jurisdiction in criminal
                                cases.
                            Mr. MARCH. For my part I look upon the grand jury as a great humbug,
                                and if there is anything that occupies the position of a star
                                chamber it is a grand jury. It is a secret body, and is a place
                                where more malicious prosecutions are got up than was ever before
                                     any court. I should be
                                ready to vote for the entire and utter abolition of the grand jury
                                It has been done in many States and they have suffered no evil from
                                it.
                            Mr. MILLER. The common pleas proscutor has more power than any other
                                judicial officer I know that the people of Indiana, a great many of
                                them, hate, abhor, loathe and despise these common pleas courts, and
                                instead of giving them greater powers I would restrict them. There
                                are not a great many instances where parties refuse to sign their
                                affidavits, and I apprehend in such cases the judge has the power,
                                or at least will exercise it at all events, when the parties refuse,
                                and make them sign it; it might be construed as a contempt of a
                                court perhaps. But if they have no such power I am not in favor of
                                giving it to them.
                            Mr. DEHART. I have already been called to witness the operations in
                                this star chamber. The law as it now stands, your honor, is this:
                                There are two modes for the procurement of an affidavit for a
                                criminal prosecution. One is that where a district prosecutor is
                                informed of a misdemeanor he makes out summonses and issues them
                                against such persons as are likely to be acquainted with the facts,
                                to come before a court of competent jurisdiction and there he may
                                examine these witnesses in the presence of that court, and if the
                                court deem the testimony sufficient to make out a case of guilty
                                then the court may authorize suit to be instituted. This power is
                                lodged in the hands of the court, where it ought to be lodged. Give
                                them the power to administer oaths and they will be a
                                self-constituted courtyou make this officer a judge and prosecutor
                                at the same time. It is to the interest of the district attorney to
                                procure as many cases as possible. He goes to a defendant and
                                proposes "if you will plead guilty to so many charges I will enter a
                                    nolle prosequi in the others." I think this
                                would be going a step too far. The only thing that gives publicity
                                to the proceedings is that witnesses are sworn by the clerk. I would
                                rather see a law compelling every examination to be made public, as
                                far as that is concerned. But to give the power into the hands of
                                the district attorney to summon and swear witnesses, I am opposed to
                                it.
                            Then came the recess till 2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The Senate resumed the consideration of Mr. March's bill, S. No. 54,
                                pending at the time of taking the recess for dinner.
                            Mr. MARCH. This bill does not increase the power of the star chamber.
                                It does not make this officer any more a spy on the affairs of the
                                public. It provides that when witnesses are summoned before a
                                justice of the peace, or Other court, the prosecutor may swear them.
                                I say the court has not the power to compel a witness to sign his
                                affidavit. But if they have this bill does not alter the law. The
                                argument used is an argument against the common pleas court. They
                                might just as well oppose improving the law of the common pleas
                                court on the ground that they are opposed to the whole thing. I can
                                not suppose a gentleman will be animated by any such principles. As
                                long as that court stands as a part of the judicial system of the
                                State it is right that every facility should be offered for its
                                administration of the law. I am not a particular friend of that
                                court. I believe a better system could be organized cheaper; but as
                                long as such a court exists I am for sustaining it. As to the grand
                                jury I take issue with the gentleman. Any person can go mousing in
                                there and peddle malice against his neighbor, and nobody knows
                                anything about it. It is made use of more as as
                                instrument of oppression than anything else.
                            Mr. DEHART. The point on which the honorable Senator from Delaware
                                [Mr. March] and the honorable Senator from St. Joseph [Mr. Miller]
                                and myself take issue, is as to the power of the common pleas court
                                to enforce a prosecuting witness to sign an affidavit. I will simply
                                read the statute, page 385 of the second revised, section 3. It
                                reads as follows: [Mr. DeHart read the section entire.] Now, your
                                honor, if that does not create a remedy, then I cannot understand
                                language. But the men who compose these grand juries are men that
                                can judge of facts, and it is seldom they present a case unfounded.
                                It is not the fault of the grand jury that indictments are not
                                sustained. You bring a witness before a court where the testimony is
                                heard and published, and if it is not enough to convict, it
                                disgraces the informant.
                            Mr. CLAYPOOL. This bill is one I would gladly give my consent to if I
                                could in consonance with my duty. But I am one of those who believe
                                that change, whether in criminal or civil procedure, ought never to
                                be made unless there is a most excellent reason for it. Never,
                                unless there is a most excellent reason for it. The Senator from
                                Delaware [Mr. March] has failed to furnish me any such cogent reason
                                that would authorize me in voting for the amendment proposed by him.
                                I look upon the prosecuting attorney as a useless appendage to the
                                courts of the country, and I would be glad o see the day come in
                                criminal jurisprudence, if this court is not to be abolished, when
                                all indictments should be made in grand jury. I mean that no man
                                shall be presented for a criminal charge except by a jury of his
                                peers. I take it, the changes sought to be made are simply to
                                enlarge and add to the powers of the District Attorney, which, in my
                                opinion, are already too large. I know, in the hands of the purest
                                men in the country, this system might do. But I have known District
                                Attorneys to tell to liquor dealers indulgences, simply to say to
                                the liquor dealer, "you may go on in your nefarious traffic, and I
                                will not indict you, if you will give me $50 a year, or $25." I  know there was, in the
                                district composed of Fayette, Union and Franklin, an attorney that
                                rarely ever presented a solitary case against a liquor dealer, and
                                yet it, was notorious that he made more money than any other
                                prosecuting attorney in that region. Why? He did it simply by
                                selling himself to these men ; and to put power into the hands of
                                such men, I am perfectly unwilling to do it. Then there is another
                                feature in the bill; and I trust Senators will consider it well
                                before they pass upon it. While it should be the duty of every good
                                citizen to see the laws enforced, there is no citizen, however good
                                his conduct, that may not be brought before his country upon a
                                charge of misdemeanor. He is at all times liable to be presented by
                                some fop of a district attorney. Our system of criminal procedure
                                has all become loose. A man that goes into the common pleas court
                                hardly ever knows whether he is tried upon an affidavit, or upon
                                information, or upon a charge by the prosecuting attorney. This
                                bill, in the hands of many prosecuting attorneys in the State, would
                                be used as an engine of oppression. I am unwilling to see the powers
                                of that prosecutor extended any farther.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER. I think I have seen the necessity of some legislation
                                in this direction ever since the common pleas system has been in
                                existence. I would go for striking out the whole system of
                                prosecutions in the common plea courts by information.
                            Mr. DeHART. These witnesses can be sworn as well by a magistrate, or
                                other officer empowered to administer an oath, as before the
                                district attorneys. - Mr. COBB hoped the bill would pass.
                            Mr. WOLFE hoped the bill would not pass.
                            The bill was then rejected by yeas 15, nays 20.

                                Mr. March's bill, S. No. 55, coming up in order, it was read the
                                    third time.
                                Mr. MARCH. We have all been talking a good deal about our good
                                    feeling for the soldiers in camp, but we have done nothing for
                                    them as yet. They get only $11 a month, and as this bill is
                                    intended for their benefit, I think it may pass. It exempts
                                    those in the actual military service of the State and United
                                    States from paying any road tax while in the service; also,
                                    members of any organized companies.
                                The bill finally passed the Senate by yeas 32, nays 5.

                                The bill H. R. 38 - see pp. 116 and 117 of these Reports - coming
                                    up in order, it was read the third time and finally passed by
                                    yeas 28, nays 11.
                            
                            
                                INCORPORATION OF TOWNS.
                                The bill H. R. 43 coming up, it was read the third time.
                                Mr. BEESON. The town of Centreville, Wayne county seat, was
                                    organized or incorporated under the law of 1852. Their corporate
                                    action was taken on one day and the law did not take effect till
                                    the next day, or two days after. The town has went on and laid
                                    out considerable money in improving the town, and getting fire
                                    engines, etc., and some question has arisen as the legality of
                                    the levying a tax therefor. This bill is to -
                                Voices - "Consent," "consent," "consent."
                                The bill was read the third time, and finally passed, by yeas 37,
                                    nays 0.
                            
                            
                                HOUSE BILLS PUT THROUGH IN QUICK TIME.
                                On motion by Mr. MELLETT, the rules were suspended - yeas 34,
                                    nays 4 - and the House bills numbered as follows were severally
                                    read the first and second time, by title only, and referred to
                                    appropriate committees:
                                The bill H. R. 57, to the Committee on Roads and
                                        Highways.
                                The bill H. R. 63, to the
                                        Committee on Military Affairs.
                                The bills H. R. 60 and
                                        54, to the
                                        Committee on Finance.
                                The bills H. R. 28 and 49,
                                    to the Committee on the Judiciary.
                                The Northern Prison bill H. R. 64 was read the second time, by
                                    title only, and referred to the Committee on the State
                                        Prison.
                                Mr. NEWCOMB, from the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary, made the following report:
                                Mr. President - The Committee on the
                                    Judiciary, to which was referred Senate bill No. 51,
                                    have had the same under consideration and have directed me to
                                    report the same back, with the following amendments:
                                1st. Strike out the word "otherwise," in line 5, section 1, and
                                    after the word "or," in said line, add these words: "or by
                                    affidavit, as in other cases of publication."
                                2d. Add to section 1 the following proviso: Provided, The suit is of that character that under the
                                    laws now in force, notice might be given by publication in a
                                    newspaper or an affidavit of non residence of the adverse party.
                                    And when the bill is so amended the committee recommend its
                                    passage.
                                On motion of Mr. NEWCOMB, the bill was considered as engrossed,
                                    and read the third time.
                                The question being, shall the bill pass? the yeas and nays were
                                    taker, but no quorum voting -
                                The Senate adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            WEDNESDAY; May 29, 1861.
                        
                        The House met at 9 o'clock.
                        Mr. ATKINSON called attention to the 46th section of the school law,
                            which provides that a school tax levy shall extend to no property except
                            that on which the tax-payer is living, and where he resides; and gave
                            notice of a bill embracing non-resident property in said vevy.
                        
                            EXTRA GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.
                            Mr. BRETT asked and obtained leave to change his vote to the
                                affirmative on the final passage of the one million appropriation
                                bill which passed the House yesterday. The bill was objectionable to
                                his mind, but he voted for it because of the appropriation for the
                                volunteers.
                        
                        
                            COMMISSARY-GENERAL.
                            Mr. BUNDY. It happened last Saturday at I occupied the chair, while
                                the resolution  was up asking
                                the Governor to remove the Commissary. I voted against that
                                resolution, but the Clerk put me down, by mistake, as voting for it.
                                I told him, however, to let it stand so, and that on Monday I would
                                move a reconsideration. But when I came in on Monday, the question
                                of reconsideration was pending on the motion of the gentleman from
                                Kosciusko. I tried to get the floor, but the motion of the gentlemen
                                from Marshall and Starke to lay it on the table prevented me. I now,
                                to do justice to my conscience, record my vote in the negative on
                                that resolution.
                            It was so ordered by unanimous consent.
                        
                        
                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
                            Messrs. Chapman, Dobbins and Owens obtained leave of absence on
                                account of ill health - 
                            Mr. OWENS saying that he would like very much for his
                                amalgamation-evidence bill to be called up while he remained to-day.
                                The Judiciary Committee had it under
                                consideration, and it would gratify him to have it reported and
                                given to its fate.
                        
                        
                            PERSONAL.
                            Mr. RAGAN stated that he perceived he was recorded in the newspapers
                                as voting here last week on some question, when he was in the State
                                of New York. He hoped that no bad votes would be credited to him in
                                his absence.
                        
                        
                            COMMON SCHOOLSTAXING NON-RESIDENTS.
                            Mr. ATKINSON now introduced his bill (64) to amend sections 3, 20 and
                                46 of the act of March 11, 1861, providing for a general system of
                                common schools, etc.
                            He said this bill, he was satisfied, would tax millions of property
                                for school purposes, which none would escape. There was non-resident
                                property lying all over the State. It only changed a few words in
                                the act, gives a remedy for certain cases of loss on the Township
                                Trustee, and repeals the necessity in the 3d section for the County
                                Commissioners to supply certain deficits.
                            On his motion (the rules being suspended for the purpose,) the bill
                                was read twice and referred to the Committee on
                                    Education.
                        
                        
                            CAVALRY IN THE SOUTH COUNTIES.
                            Mr. VEATCH submitted the following:
                            A Joint Resolution (10) requesting; the Governor to call out and put
                                under drill a company of cavalry militia in each of the counties
                                upon the Ohio river for sixty days:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved by the General Assembly of the
                                                State of Indiana, That the Governor of the
                                            State be requested to call into service one company of
                                            cavalry militia, not exceeding sixty-seven men, in each
                                            county bordering on the Ohio river, and that said
                                            companies be placed under the instruction of competent
                                            drill officers for a period of sixty days. At which time
                                            if their services are not needed, they shall be
                                            discharged, subject to be called out at any time. The
                                            said companies to furnish their own horses and horse
                                            equipments and uniforms, but to be furnished with arms
                                            by the State under the provisions of the present militia
                                            law.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. VEATCH. If troops were needed any where in the world, they were
                                needed in the Southern counties. We did not propose a standing
                                force, but simply to call out companies for drill. It was well known
                                that cavalry would be inefficient without drill; and they can not be
                                drilled unless they are placed under the charge of experienced
                                officers. He had put the time of training down to 60 days, as the
                                shortest period. Then these cavalry, when discharged from service,
                                will be right at home where they are needed, and will be ready to
                                come out upon the shortest notice. If you organize squadrons in
                                other parts of the State you will not have this advantage. The State
                                will have to pay nothing for uniform, horses and horse equipments,
                                only furnish the arms, which, I understand, are now on hand. All
                                that is proposed here is to request the Governor to call out these
                                companies and place them under drill.
                            Mr. HOLCOMB would modify the words of the gentleman from Spencer so
                                as to say, "if we need cavalry anywhere in the State of Indiana, we
                                need them in the Southern counties."
                            Mr. VEATCH. I accept the amendment
                            Mr. HOLCOMB thought it was as little as I could be done for the
                                border counties, under the circumstances, when there was such a loud
                                and determined call for it.
                        
                        
                            ADVANCE PAY FOR THE INDIANA VOLUNTEERS.
                            Pending the consideration of this resolution, Mr. Speaker ALLEN
                                interposed the prerogative of the Chair, and introduced a joint
                                resolution, [11] which was read, as follows:
                            WHEREAS, the six Regiments of Indiana volunteers known as the three
                                months men, have been ordered into active service, and a portion of
                                them are now about to march to their field of service ; and whereas,
                                said troops have been in camp for two months, and will not under the
                                rules and regulations of the United States army, receive any portion
                                of their pay for some time; and whereas, it is desirable that the
                                volunteers of the State of Indiana should not be sent to the field
                                without the means of procuring the necessary comforts not permitted
                                under the rules and regulations of the army.
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Therefore be it resolved by the General Assembly of the
                                            State of Indiana, That the treasurer pay to the
                                            commanding officer of each of the six regiments in the
                                            three months' service the sum of three thousand eight
                                            hundred and fifty dollars, to be by the said commanding
                                            officer distributed equally to the privates, musicians,
                                            non commissioned and commissioned officers of each
                                            regiment.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved further, That the commanding
                                            officer of each company furnish to the commanding
                                            officer of his regiment a company pay-roll, upon which
                                            shall be entered opposite the name of each private and
                                            officer the amount of money pain to him, which pay rolls
                                            shall be filed by said officer in the office of the
                                            Treasurer of State at the earliest convenience of the
                                            commanding officer of the regiment.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved further, That the sum of money
                                            hereby authorized to be paid, shall be considered part
                                            of the money known as the military fund, in the general
                                            appropriation bill.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved further, That the money hereby
                                            directed to be paid, shall be considered as an advance
                                            in behalf of the United States, to be returned out of
                                            the money first paid to the said troops.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair has been credibly informed that these men have
                                not received any pay, and that it is not yet known when they  will; and that most of them
                                have not money enough to buy their tobacco. The sum proposed to be
                                advanced here - $3,850 to each regiment - will make just five
                                dollars to each private, musician, and non commissioned and
                                commissioned company officer.
                            Mr. GRESHAM accorded fully the necessity for the resolution. These
                                troops have gone off and should not be neglected as to pay. He would
                                vote for it, if it were a simple donation with no prospect of
                                reimbursement.
                            Mr. HENRICKS stated that the 9th regiment had borrowed just that
                                amount of money for each man through the note of their officers, in
                                the Bank of the State; and he requested that they should be placed
                                on the same footing of the rest, notwithstanding this. Their quota
                                might lift the note of these officers.
                            Mr. LANE hoped the resolution would pass by an unanimous vote.
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair would state to the gentleman from St. Joseph
                                that th General Assembly could hardly provide for paying a note in
                                bank.
                            Mr. BRANHAM. Their money might remain and be placed to their credit
                                in the treasury.
                            Mr. KNOWLTON would like to know the, prospect of reimbursement.
                            The SPEAKER. That will be in the nature of a claim on the United
                                States.
                            Mr. BRETT had a conversation with certain officers last night, who
                                said they were willing to pay this advance to the men out of their
                                own pay.
                            Mr. PROSSER suggested that the volunteers should receive this money
                                as an advance on their pay.
                            Mr. FISHER. The United States Government would pay any reasonable
                                expense in getting up the troops of volunteers. Unless the United
                                States should pay, there would be no other chance or expectation of
                                reimbursement.
                            The SPEAKER. How would it suit the gentlemen to add another
                                resolution: That this money "shall be considered as an advance on
                                the behalf of the United States, to be returned out of the first
                                money received by said troops." [See the last resolution.]
                            "Consent." "Consent."
                            The resolution was adopted with this modification - yeas 75, nays 0 -
                                the title being amended so as to read as follows: A joint resolution
                                to authorize the payment of money, by way of advance, to the six
                                regiments of Indiana volunteers, known as the three months men.
                        
                        
                            CAVALRY IN THE SOUTH COUNTIES.
                            The SPEAKER. The House will now proceed with the consideration of the
                                joint resolution of the gentleman from Spencer.
                            Mr. VEATCH. All I want is the organization and drill, in order that
                                these companies, if necessary, when they shall be discharged, may
                                form a nuclear for drilling others.
                            Mr. FERGUSON. The only point in the matter, as I understand it, is
                                that the House now proposes to decide for the Governor that it is
                                necessary to call out cavalry.
                            Mr. PROSSER could not see any present necessity for this. A cavalry
                                proposition had been voted down by the General Assembly, and the
                                Governor had refused to organize cavalry at a time when Kentucky's
                                loyalty was much more doubtful than it is now. He counselled now
                                that we should not do anything in this direction which is not
                                absolutely necessary. He suggested that the resolution be modified
                                so that these companies shall drill at their own expense, under the
                                militia law - the State furnishing the arms. He proposed to amend by
                                striking out all that relates to pay.
                            Mr. VEATCH. The gentleman certainly does not mean to insult the House
                                by offering a thing utterly futile and foolish. The militia law
                                already provides fur precisely what he would propose. He certainly
                                does not propose to throw upon the House, a proposition utterly
                                ridiculous and foolish. This resolution makes no distinction between
                                the proposed companies and other militia, except the pay and
                                drill.
                            Mr. PROSSER did not mean to insult the House, but if the House adopt
                                the resolution in this shape, the people will say who has acted
                                ridiculously and foolishly. He saw in it a proposition to give
                                commissions to partizan favorites.
                            Mr. WOODHULL said the intention of the Governor was expressed in a
                                communication to the Senate yesterday, almost in the very terms of
                                this resolution, there was, therefore, no necessity for it. Let the
                                border counties have arms, and let them drill at their own expense,
                                as they themselves have all along proposed.
                            Mr. BUNDY, in view, of its expense, and in the absence of its
                                necessity, was also opposed to the resolution. We had done enough in
                                this direction. All that, was necessary now, was to organize the
                                militia.
                            Mr. EDSON considered that they of the border counties had done enough
                                in the way of asking protection of the legislature, and receiving
                                nothing. He considered that appropriations should be made in those
                                places where the danger will come, if it comes at all. They, had yet
                                received no arms.
                            Mr. RAGAN. Our cannon went down.
                            Mr. EDSON. Where?
                            Mr. RAGAN. To Switzerland county.
                            Mr. EUSON. Yes, as the gentleman from Spencer says, you arm the
                                quaker and quinine districts. You provide for defense on the border
                                where the people of Kentucky opposite are all Union men, and leave
                                us uncared for, within three hours of the first congressional
                                Kentucky district, where they are soon to hold a secession
                                convention, &c. He spoke at length in this direction, claiming
                                the resolution as a matter of sheer prudence, justice and
                                economy.
                            Mr. McLEAN. It was evident that this joint resolution could not pass
                                bodi branches, of the General Assembly, A similar proposition for a
                                regiment had failed in the Senate-yesterday after full debate - the
                                vote being 13 to 29. He recited the intentions expressed in  the Governor's message to the
                                Senate yesterday, and was willing to trust his discretion as to the
                                movement and disposition of the State troops. He deprecated all
                                sectional feeling in these, questions, and added his opinion that
                                the border counties had been considerately and liberally dealt with
                                by the Legislature.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG demanded the previous question, and under its
                                pressure, the vote on Mr. Prosser's amendment was reported - yeas

                            DOCKET FEE BILL.
                            On the motion of Mr. PACKAKD the House took up the calender of Senate
                                messages.
                            The docket fee bill, [S. 31,]
                                coming up -
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG moved to suspend the rules for the second
                                reading.
                            Mr. JENKINSON opposed. The bill was an outrage upon county
                                treasurer.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG demanded the previous question, and so his motion
                                went to the vote - yeas 55, nays 19 - and the bill was passed to the
                                second reading.
                            Mr. JENKINSON proposed to amend "by striking "out the part in
                                relation to payment of fees from the county treasuries."
                            Mr. BUNDY. The bill inaugurates the new principle of paying the
                                District Attorney out of the county treasury, where he fails to
                                collect it.

                            On the motion of Mr. BUNDY, the bill and amendment were referred to

                            TWO MILLION LOAN.
                            On motion of Mr. McLEAN, the bill, [S. 47,] directing the proceeds of the State debt and
                                sinking fund tax of the bill of March 9, 1861, to the payment of the
                                interest on the two million loan, was taken up, read twice, (under
                                dispensation,) and referred to the Committee on Ways and
                                    Means.

                            On motion of Mr. PACKARD, the bill [S. 42] to amend the railroad
                                process bill of March 4, 1859, the same which passed the House in
                                the regular session, to fix the legal notice of the officers,
                                directors, attorneys and agents of railroad companies whose
                                principal offices are without the State, to "at least fifteen days,"
                                was taken up and read twice under a dispensation.
                            Mr. BUNDY proposed to amend by striking out the newspaper publication
                                clause.
                            On motion of Mr. DAVIS, the amendment was laid on the table.
                            Mr. BUNDY made an ineffectual motion to refer the bill to the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary.
                            The bill was then passed to the third reading in the House of
                                Representatives - yeas 67, nays 3.

                            The fee and perquisite statement bill [S. 43] coming up, it was passed
                                to the second reading.

                            The Commissioner's conveyance bill [S. 41] was passed to the first
                                reading.
                            On motion by Mr. WOODHULL, (there being a suspension for the
                                purpose,) the bill was read and considered on the second
                                reading.
                            The House then took a recess till two o'clock P.M.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            On the motion of Mr. STOTSENBERG, his bill (62) providing for the
                                impeachment of witnesses in certain cases, was considered on the
                                second reading and referred to the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary.
                            Mr. JONES, of Vermillion, introduced a bill (65) to provide
                                additional compensation for State officers therein named: which was
                                passed to the second reading.

                            
                                EXTERIOR QUARTER SECTIONS ON THE NORTH AND WEST
                                    OF TOWNSHIPS.
                                Mr. COLLINS, of Adams, submitted a report of the sub-divisions of
                                    the exterior quarter sections on the north and west of
                                    townships, which was ordered to be spread on the journal.
                                The exterior quarter sections to which the resolution refers, are
                                    fractional, containing more or less than the regular quantity of
                                    160 acres; and the same rule for subdivisions that applies to
                                    other portions of these townships does not apply to these
                                    exterior quarter-sections. We find, however, by examining the
                                    books and plats at the land office at this place, that, up to
                                    about the year 1822, there was not a settled policy by the
                                    General Government; so that in some instances, before and up to
                                    that date, the subdivision was made into lots of equal size; so
                                    that the river lots were more or less than 80 rods in width,
                                    according to the size of the fractional quarter. But from that
                                    date the rule seems to be settled, that the person purchasing
                                    the inner lot shall have 80 rods in width; and the fraction,
                                    whether over  or under the
                                    regular quantity, to be thrown upon the outer lot. The committee
                                    add, that the clerk of surveys has a discretionary power in
                                    prescribing rules and regulations, where the law is not
                                    sufficiently clear and explicit; and quote from the instructions
                                    by John H. Moore, Principal Clerk of Surveys to the Surveyor
                                    General of the United States: "the lots in the extreme northern
                                    and western sections, containing either more or less than the
                                    regular quantity, are always to be numbered per example.
                                    Interior lots in such extreme tiers are to be 20 chains wide,
                                    and the excess or deficiency of measurement is always to be
                                    thrown on the exterior lots; elsewhere the assumed subdivisional
                                    corner will always be a point equi-distant from the established
                                    corners,." page 26. The committee find in the game work diagrams
                                    for illustration, showing conclusively that the legal mode for
                                    subdividing exterior quarter sections on the north and
                                    townships, is to make the inner lots 80 rods wide and throw the
                                    exterior deficience on the exterior or outer lots.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG asked and obtained leave to change his vote to
                                    the negative, on the resolution to request the Governor to
                                    remove the Commissary General.
                                Mr. VEATCH, from the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary, returned the old (Perry) county
                                    buildings bill (S. 27)
                                    with the amendment in the second and fourth sections. The
                                    amendments were concurred in and ordered to be engrossed.
                            
                            
                                FINES AND FORFEITURES FOR SCHOOL FUND.
                                Mr. WOODHULL, from the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary, returned Mr. Black's fines and
                                    forfeitures bill (49) without amendment, and with a
                                    recommendation that the same do pass.
                                Mr. BLACK. Mr. Speaker - By the operation; of that bill there
                                    will be some $138,000 to $140,000, now lying dormant in the
                                    hands of the Clerks of the Circuit Court, turned into the school
                                    fund. I am confident of this, by making an average there will be
                                    found $1,500 in each county. It will take money from the Clerks
                                    which they have long held, and which does not belong to
                                    them.
                                The bill was considered as engrossed and passed the final reading

                                    returned a paper with a motion that it be laid on the table, for
                                    the reason that the matter is now pending in due form in the

                                    returned the claim of Seward House, Terre Haute, for quartering
                                    volunteers, with the expression of opinion that the claim ought
                                    not to be allowed.
                                Mr. ROBERTS, from the Committee on Military

                                Mr. McCLURG, from the Committee on Military
                                        Affairs, returned Mr. Orr's resolution to exempt

                                    motion that it be laid on the table.
                                Mr. GRESHAM, from the Committee on Military
                                        Affairs, returned Mr. Veatch's supplemental
                                    militia bill [52], with a motion that it be laid on the
                                    table.

                                ROAD LOCATION.
                                Mr. WELLS, from the Committee on Roads and
                                        Highways, returned Mr. Anderson's highway bill
                                    [57], with a recommendation of passage.
                                Mr. ANDERSON made an ineffectual'motion to consider it as
                                    engrossed, and put it on the final passage; but upon his
                                    statement of its object, viz: authorizing a change of any road
                                    location by view and assessment darnages -
                                On motion by Mr. FRASIER, the vote was reconsidered, and the bill
                                    passed the final reading - yeas 53, nays 22.
                            
                            
                                BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS.
                                Mr. KENDRICK, from the Committee on Benevolent
                                        Institutions, reported a bill [67], fixing the tenure of
                                    the affairs of the Superintendent of the Hospital for the
                                    Insane, and the Superintendent of the Institution for the
                                    Education of the Deaf and Dumb, and for the Education of the
                                    Blind, and fixing the compensation of said superintendents. [The
                                    term is four years. The salary of the Superintendent of the

                                STREET RAILROAD BILL.
                                Mr. HURD, from the Committee on Corporations,
                                    returned the street railroad bill, [S. 28] with an amendment,
                                    adding a section to the effect that nothing herein contained
                                    shall be so construed as to take away from the Common Council of
                                    incorporated cities the exclusive control of the streets,
                                    &c.; and as so amended the committee recommended the passage
                                    of the bill.
                                The report was concurred in.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG proposed to recommit the bill with instructions
                                    to amend by inserting an amendment to the effect that the
                                    stockholders in such companies or corporations shall be
                                    individually responsible to an amount over and above their
                                    stock, equal to their several shares therein, for the debts and
                                    liabilities of said corporation.
                                Mr. BUNDY made an ineffectual motion to lay the motion and
                                    amendment on the table.
                                The motion of Mr. Stotsenberg was then agreed to.
                            
                            
                                JAIL ACCOMMODATION.
                                Mr. PARRETT, from the Committee on
                                        Corporations, returned the petition from the
                                    inhabitants of the town of Newport, Warrick county, reporting
                                    legislation expedient thereon, and reporting therewith a bill
                                        [67] to authorize
                                    incorporated towns and cities to erect prisons, and to authorize
                                    the imprisonment therein of persons convicted of offences
                                    against the laws of said corporations, or against the penal laws
                                    of this State, and persons charged with offences punishaable by
                                    indictment or presentment, temporarily;  and to provide for the use of
                                    county jails by such corporations in certain cases.
                                The bill was twice read under a dispensation of the rules.
                                Mr. PARRETT said it was simply to supply a deficiency in the law
                                    of 1852.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON suggested a provision to authorize the working of
                                    such prisoners on a farm or on the streets.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG. The general law now authorizes city authorities
                                    to work convicts on the streets.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON. Does it extend to incorporated towns?
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG. I don't know.
                                Mr. BUNDY moved to strike out "prison," wherever it occurs, and
                                    insert "calabouse."
                                This was laid on the table by consent, as "having a Southern
                                    twang," on the motion of Mr. Orr.
                                The bill was then ordered to engrossment, considered engrossed
                                    and passed the House of Representatives - yeas 76, nays 12.

                                Mr. PARRETT, from the Committee on
                                        Corporations, returned the street railroad bill,
                                    (S. 28) with an
                                    amendment: "The stockholders of such Company shall be
                                    individually responsible to an amount over and above their stock
                                    equal to their shares in such corporation, for all the debts and
                                    liabilities thereof; and, so amended, the committee recommended
                                    the passage of the bill.
                                The report was concurred in; and, so amended, the bill was passed
                                    to the final reading in the House of Representatives - yeas 67,
                                    nays 2.

                                Mr. PARRETT, from the committee on
                                        corporations, returned Mr. Lane's railroad bill,
                                        [53] with an
                                    amendment by way of substitute, providing that any railroad
                                    company, having expended $400,000 on its road bed within three
                                    years from the date of its charter, shall have ten years from
                                    and after the year 1861 to complete the road - designed to
                                    revive the charter of the Indiana and Illinois Central Railroad,
                                    extending from Indianapolis to Springfield.
                                The report was concurred in by consent.
                                Mr. LANE moved that the bill be considered as engrosed, and read
                                    the third time now.
                                [The consideration of the bill was passed over by a recess of ten
                                    minutes, on account of a flag presentation in the yard.]
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG moved to reconsider the vote adopting the motion
                                    of Mr. Frasier to reconsider the vote on the passage of the
                                    resolution of address to the Governor to remove the Commissary
                                    General. The testimony had now been printed, and he desired the
                                    resolution to be considered again on a more deliberate review of
                                    the testimony.
                                Mr. FISHER and Mr. BUNDY seconded the motion, expressing the
                                    opinion that the action of the House had been hasty in the
                                    premises. But -
                                Mr. KNOWLTON made the point of order, that, where a motion to
                                    reconsider had been once laid on the table, there was an end of
                                    reconsiderations.
                                The CHAIR sustained the point, and so the matter rested.
                                Mr. TURNER asked and obtained leave to record his vote in the
                                    negative on the resolution of address to the Governor for the
                                    removal of the Commissary General.
                            
                            
                                INDIANA AND ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD.
                                The House now resumed the consideration of Mr. Lane's railroad
                                    bill, [53.]
                                Mr. BUNDY. Mr. Speaker, I want to know whether that bill is to
                                    revive all the extinct railroad charters in the State, or
                                    whether it is to apply simply to the Indiana and Illinois road.
                                    If it is to be confined to that road exclusively, I shall not
                                    oppose it.
                                Mr. PARRETT. The bill only revives road charters under the act of
                                    1852, where the company have expended over $400,000. Further
                                    than this it revives no forfeited charter.
                                Mr. FERGUSON. There was one road which he was fearful it might
                                    revive - the Evansville, Indianapolis and Cleveland railroad. He
                                    was not advised precisely as to the amount expended on diat
                                    road; but it was, perhaps, about $280,000, with the pretence of
                                    perhaps $400,000 or $500,000 squandered. It might be an easy
                                    matter for them to make out their case, and come within the
                                    provisions of this bill. He complained of some proceedings in
                                    connection with this bill, or a similar one, when it was
                                    introduced at the regular session. He wished simply to guard
                                    against dishonest companies, and hoped the House would not pass
                                    the bill.
                                Mr. LANE. What was the gentleman's objection to it.
                                Mr. FERGUSON. His objections were in his fear of the revival of
                                    the charter of the Evansville, Indianapolis and Cleveland road.
                                    It might be an easy matter for them, by hocus pocus, to prove
                                    themselves within the provisions of this bill. He was informed
                                    last winter, when a similar bill was pending, that there were
                                    some 29 or 30 books opened for stock subscription on that road,
                                    in one county, and that other books were opened along the line.
                                    He did not oppose the bill because he objected to the completion
                                    of the Indiana and Illinois railroad.
                                Mr. RAGAN. The gentleman reminded him of the proverb that a burnt
                                    child dreads the fire; they had been doubtless pretty badly
                                    burnt down there. [Laughter.] It was like the case of a man
                                    afraid of thunder because he might get struck with lightning. If
                                    the gentleman had gone back to inform himself as to how much had
                                    been expended on the Evansville road, he would have been
                                    prepared to object to our bill. He did not know much about that
                                    road. It was called an air line; and most that there was of it
                                    was clear up in the air. and never touched the ground; and those
                                    who were foolish enough to subscribe stock had bought their
                                    experience in a dear school.  He hoped that no such objection as this would allowed to
                                    affect the prospect of the Illinois and Indiana road, which was
                                    now graded pearly to the Wabash river.
                                Mr. FERGUSON. If you will deprive the Evansville road of its
                                    benefits, I will vote for the bill.
                                Mr. RAGAN. That would be special legislation. He proceeded at
                                    length to state the importance of this road to Springfield,
                                    Illinois, and the ruin that must fall upon many of the
                                    stockholders if this bill should fail.
                                Mr. BUNDY moved to recommit the bill, with instructions to report
                                    a bill whose benefits shall apply only to the corporation known
                                    as the Indiana and Illinois Central railroad company. Why would
                                    not gentlemen consent to that? Was it because they must have a
                                    general law? He entertained no sort of doubt that a bill
                                    reviving by name the Indiana and Illinois Central railroad would
                                    be legal and constitutional; and in this opinion he was
                                    supported by many of the best lawyers of the State. He offered
                                    no opposition to this road per se. He would continue all the
                                    rights they have acquired under their charter. He could tell the
                                    reason why his amendment was not acceptable: it was because the
                                    friends of the bill had hitched on to it the interests of a half
                                    a dozen dead charters.
                                Mr. PARRETT. The gentleman is mistaken as to that hitching on. I
                                    drew the amendment myself, without consulting any railroad man,
                                    but I consulted two lawyers - Mr. Usher, of Perryville, and
                                    Judge McDonald, of this place; and I say to the friends of the
                                    bill, that it is not merely their bill, but the best bill we can
                                    furnish.
                                Mr. BUNDY proceeded to insist that he had taken his objection
                                    fairly, admitting that the bill has merits, if it could be shorn
                                    of its connection with other interests.
                                Mr. CRAIN. This road passes through his county. His people were
                                    greatly interested in it. The bill could not be constitutionally
                                    framed to apply to that road alone, and if it runs across the
                                    path of gentlemen they have but one thing to do. He did not
                                    complain of gentlemen for their opposition, but he hoped no bad
                                    faith would be charged The bill could not revive the Cleveland
                                    road, because that road had already gone into liquidation. The
                                    charter of the Indiana and Illinois road would expire ten days
                                    before the next regular session of the Legislature. If it were
                                    completed, he had no doubt that it would be a paying interest;
                                    but if not, many a man in his county would lose his all. He
                                    hoped the amendment would not prevail.
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN, [Mr. Lane in the chair.] The gentleman from
                                    Henry [Mr. Bundy] was laboring under a mistake in supposing this
                                    bill to be aided by the friends of defunct corporations. It was
                                    his belief that the more friends of this sort it might obtain,
                                    the less would be the probability of its passage. There was one
                                    such road in his end of the State, but he was certain it had not
                                    a single friend in the House.
                                Mr. BUNDY understood that the Senate has passed a similar bill,
                                    with the amount at $200,000.
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN. The bill of the Senate is not before us. This
                                    bill requires that $400,000 shall be expended.
                                Mr. FERGUSON. Was there no other way of guarding the bill than by
                                    putting in this $400,000?
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN would say to the gentleman, that, if the
                                    Evansville and Indianapolis straight line road company had
                                    expended a million of dollars, it could not avail itself of the
                                    benefits of this bill, for the reason that there was a decree of
                                    forfeiture entered against it; and there was an exception
                                    contained in the bill that no such corporation could avail
                                    itself of its privileges. He had opposed the $200,000 sum in a
                                    former bill, and would still do so. The Indiana and Illinois
                                    Central Company was an honest corporation, and this bill revived
                                    that charter alone. It would revive no fraudulent concern, but
                                    still, if there was another road in the State which had expended
                                    $400,000 in construction, in good faith, he apprehended that the
                                    members of this Legislature would be entirely willing that they
                                    should come under the bill. But for the purpose of obviating all
                                    objection, he would move to amend by inserting a clause to the
                                    following effect: "There shall be expended thereon $400,000 in
                                    the construction, in good faith, on the road bed thereof,
                                    exclusive of expenses for pay of officers, right of way,
                                    engineering, and other incidental expenses."
                                Mr. BUNDY. Will the gentleman agree to recommit the bill?
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN. I think that would be fatal to the bill. It is
                                    too late in the session to admit of the delay.
                                Mr. HOLCOMB hoped the friends of the bill would allow the bill to
                                    be recommitted.
                                Mr. HOPKINS was anxious to vote for this bill. He was a director
                                    in the Evansville road, and did not desire a revival of its
                                    charter, which would be impossible under these restrictions.
                                Mr. JENKINSON proposed to recommit with instructions to provide
                                    that it shall be optional with the stockholders of such
                                    railroads to withdraw from the corparation; to have their
                                    rateable portion of stock paid back; and henceforth they shall
                                    not be liable to any assessment of such corporations.
                                The SPEAKER decided the latter proposition out of order.
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN'S amendment was adopted by consent.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG demanded the previous question, and under its
                                    force. Mr. Bundy's proposition was rejected, and the bill passed
                                    the final reading in the House of Representatives - yeas 61,
                                    nays 18 - with an amendment of  title, viz.: "An act to extend the
                                    time for the completion of certain railroads.
                            
                            
                                THE $2,000,000 LOAN.
                                Mr. FISHER, from the Committee of Ways and
                                        Means, returned the bill [S. 47] to make additional
                                    provision for the payment of the "two million lean," with an
                                    amendment striking out the commission named in the bill, and
                                    inserting in lieu thereof these words, "the State Debt Fund
                                    Commissioners."
                                Mr. FISHER. The change made is this: The original bill provides
                                    that the loan commissioners shall appropriate any funds that
                                    shall be received from the government by way of reimbursing the
                                    State, and also the proceeds of the 2 1/2 cents tax to the
                                    purchase of these bonds. The design of the amendment is that as
                                    soon as the loan commissioners shall have effected the loan
                                    their services shall cease, and it proposes to confer their
                                    duties on the State Debt Fund Commissioners, and they are the
                                    Governor, and the Auditor and Treasurer of State.
                                Mr. BUNDY professed that he did not yet understand the bill.
                                The SPEAKER. It provides that the two and a half cents tax of
                                    last winter shall go to pay the six per cent, bonds instead of
                                    the two and a half per cent, and five per cent, bonds.
                                Mr. CRAIN. There are but two points in it: One is to take the two
                                    and a half cents tax in the bill of March the 9th, created to
                                    redeem the five and two and a half per cent, bonds, and divert
                                    the proceeds of that tax and apply it to the payment of the
                                    bonds now to be sold. The other is that the money which the
                                    General Government shall refund to the State of Indiana shall
                                    also be applied to the payment of this $2,000,000 loan.
                                Mr. FISHER. The object is, in short, that we may retire the stock
                                    drawing six percent, instead of the stock drawing five and two
                                    and a half per cent.
                                Mr. DAVIS. If there is any money on hand it shall be invested in
                                    these six per cent, bonds.
                                Mr. FISHER, Yes, sir, provided they are invested at par.
                                The bill, as thus amended, was passed the final reading - yeas
                                    76, nays 1.
                            
                            
                                ABOLITION OF THE COMMON PLEAS.
                                Mr. BINGHAM, from the Committee on the Organization of
                                        Courts, returned Mr. Speaker Allen's court bill
                                    [51] with a motion that it be laid on the table, for the reason
                                    that there is not time to perfect so radical a change in the
                                    judicial system, He said he was favorable to the bill himself
                                    notwithstanding the report he had made, and he would like for a
                                    test vote to be taken on concurrence in the report. It was a
                                    proposition simply to abolish the common pleas court; to
                                    transfer its business to the circuit court, and to increase the
                                    number of circuits to twenty-eight. There was now fourteen.
                                Mr. PARRETT. How can the vote on concurrence be a test vote?
                                Mr. BINGHAM. Let there be a rising vote, Those against the change
                                    will vote for concurrence, and those in favor of it will vote
                                    against concurrence.
                                The division on the concurrence was reported affirmative 41,
                                    negative 31
                                So the report was concurred in and the bill was laid on the
                                    table.
                            
                            
                                IMPEACHMENT OF WITNESSES.
                                Mr. CASON, from the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary, returned Mr. Stotsenberg's witness
                                    impeachment bill [00] recommending its passage.
                                The report was concurred in and the bill was considered as
                                    engrossed.
                                Mr. CASON explained that the bill was to meet the case of
                                    impeachment of a witness wherein he declares that he does not
                                    recollect having done the act or made the statement upon which
                                    the object, of the impeachment rests. It gives the right to the
                                    impeaching party to introduce witnesses to prove the act done or
                                    the statement made, in the case of the denial of
                                    recollection.
                                Mr. CRAIN. It was to make the practice conform to the bill passed
                                    last winter whereby parties are allowed to swear in their own
                                    case.
                                Mr. WOODHULL. This bill was a proposition to impeach a man's
                                    recollection. It would overturn the fixed rules of practice
                                    governing evidence.
                                After further debate by Mr. Cason and Mr. Woodhull-
                                Mr. FRASIER added his testimony to what had been said in support
                                    of the bill. There was a defect here in the working of our
                                    jurisprudence. Shrewd witnesses were able to prejudice cases
                                    with perfect impunity, behind the want of recollection.
                                Mr. JONES of Tippecanoe demanded the previous question, and under
                                    its operation the bill finally passed the House of
                                    Representatives - yeas 59, nays 10.
                                The House then, at 6 o'clock, took a recess till 7 1/2 o'clock,
                                    P. M.
                            
                            
                                NIGHT SESSION.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG submitted a resolution, which was adopted,
                                    limiting speeches to five minutes.
                                Mr. BLACK introduced a bill [68] to repeal the 73d section of the assessment act
                                    of 1852; which was passed to a second reading.
                                Mr. FISHER, from the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means, introduced a bill [69] making additional
                                    specific appropriations for the year 1861.
                                It was passed to the second reading.
                                On motion by Mr. FISHER, (the rules being suspended for the
                                    purpose,) the bill was read the second time by title, and
                                    considered on the second reading.
                                Mr. JENKINSON resisted the claim of John W. Dodd for $877, on
                                    account of expenses in- 
                                    curred by him in detecting guilty parties in connection with the
                                    Boone county bank frauds, and moved that Mr. D. receive his
                                    claim in fees he has retained.
                                Mr. FISHER stated the reasons which induced the committee to
                                    report the allowance: His oath that helms expended that amount;
                                    that the arrest of this bank fraud prevented the throwing of
                                    $200,000 of this fraudulent paper into circulation, and the
                                    inducement to State officers to be vigilant in such cases.
                                Mr. BUNDY. It was opening the door too wide; the case had been
                                    adjucated and the claim was rejected at the last session
                                Mr. JENKINSON withdrew his motion; and then -
                                On motion of Mr. FRASIER, the allowance was stricked out.
                                On motion by Mr. Speaker ALLEN, (Mr. Sherman in the Chair,) Azur
                                    P. Newkirk, for preparing the index and superintending the
                                    printing of the House Journal, was allowed $150.
                                After further amendments, amongst which were the usual
                                    propositions to raise the compensation of the principal and the
                                    principal assistant clerk, and of the enrolling, engrossing and
                                    messenger clerks, to four dollars a day -
                                The House, at 9:45 o'clock, adjourned till tomorrow morning at 9
                                    o'clock.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            THURSDAY, May 30, 1861.
                        
                        Mr. BEESON, from the Committee on Federal relations,
                            made the following report.
                        Mr. PRESIDENT - The Committee on Federal Relations, to
                            which was referred House joint resolution No. 7. [see pages 154, 155 and
                            156 of these Reports,] have had the same under consideration, and direct
                            me to report it back with the following amendments, viz, and when so
                            amend ed, recommend its passage:
                        "Amend by adding to the first resolution these words, viz: 'And to
                            blockade effectively all Southern seaports against the world, and with
                            the distinct understanding that the war shall be prosecuted only for the
                            purpose of crushing out rebellion, restoring the Union, maintaining the
                            Constitution, enforcing the laws and securing American liberty.'"
                        Amend further by striking out, wherever they occur, the words
                            '"Congressmen" and "members of Congress," and inserting "Representatives
                            in Congress."
                        Mr. SLACK moved the following amendment: After the word "liberty" add the
                            following: "and not for any sectional, political or antislavery
                            purposes."
                        Mr. MELLETT moved to lay the amendment on the table.
                        Mr. ANTHONY. I desire to make a short explanation of my vote.
                        The PRESIDENT. Upon a motion to lay on the table, the question is not
                            debateable.
                        Mr. ANTHONY. I only wish to say that I am opposed to prosecuting this war
                            for any such purposes as the gentleman seems to indicate in the
                            amendment, and I insist, as the resolution says, that the war is not to
                            be prosecuted only for certain purposes, which I believe are
                            legitimate.
                        Mr. SLACK. I wish to say why I shall vote for the amendment. The Senator
                            from Floyd says he does not believe this war is being prosecuted for any
                            such purposes. I do not believe it is, nor do I hesitate to say so.
                            Whatever I believe to be the truth, I do not hesitate to put in black
                            and white.
                        The PRESIDENT. Debate will not be indulged one moment. - The motion to
                            lay on the table was rejected by yeas 19, nays 21 - as follows:
                        
                            
                                
                                    YEAS - Messrs. Anthony, Bearss, Beeson, Blair, Campbell,

                        Mr. CLAYPOOL moved to amend the amendment by striking out the words
                            "return to the people."
                        Mr. CLAYPOOL. I understand the language of the resolutions not only
                            request these men to resign, but to return to the people. Now, sir, I do
                            not wish, and I cannot vote, for traitors to return to the soil of
                            Indiana. I would prefer they go to England or any other land, anywhere
                            on the face of God's green earth would I prefer to see a traitor than in
                            Indiana. I understand a person who comes within the per view of these
                            resolutions to be an enemy to the country. While making these remarks I
                            desire, for the purpose of placing myself right upon the record on the
                            vote just passed, to make some reference to the resolutions and the
                            amendment offered by the Senator from Huntington [Mr. Slack.] I do not
                            understand that this war is prosecuted for any such purposes as the
                            subjugation or extirpation of slavery, or anything of that kind. I do
                            not say it is riot prosecuted for an hundred other purposes, and for
                            that very reason when I am inclined to express any opinion upon a matter
                            of that kind it is mere outside show. I take it that all these
                            propositions are thrust forward for some ulterior purposes and objects,
                            and not, in my humble opinion, are they calculated to produce harmony in
                            the country. I would like to see the utmost harmony prevail upon these
                            kind of matters.
                        Mr. RAY. This amendment is in entire harmony with the policy of the
                            Government. If we look to the letter which Gen. Butler addressed to Gov.
                            Andrew, to Gen. Butler's proclamation in Baltimore, and look to the
                            proclamation made yesterday by Gen. McClellan, I have no hesitation in
                            saying, if those declarations express the sentiment of the Government,
                            this amendment is in entire harmony with the policy of the
                            Administration, and for that reason I vote for it.
                        Mr. CLAYPOOL. [interposing.] If that is the policy of the Administration,
                            and that is being carried out by the army of the Government, what is the
                            necessity for the Senate of Indiana to vote to instruct them in the line
                            of policy to be adopted?
                        Mr. RAY. It is for the same necessity that induces us, in political
                            meetings and through  legislative
                            bodies, when we approve the policy of a Government to approbate it in
                            the most emphatic way. I am willing to stand pledged to support the
                            Administration to the last extremity in a war carried on for the
                            purposes expressed in the resolutions, while I should be equally willing
                            to declare that I would not support it for a moment in carrying on a war
                            for any other purpose. I think it is the duty of this General Assembly
                            to endorse this policy, and say to Senators and Representatives in
                            Congress, "God speed" in this work, and if there be one willing to
                            plunge the country into war for unholy purposes these are instructions
                            that will limit him, and say to him that this is to be a war strictly
                            for the purpose of putting down rebellion, maintaining Federal authority
                            over Federal property, vindicating its laws and maintaining the honor of
                            its flag everywhere. When it is known in Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland,
                            and Western Virginia; when the Administration declares it, when Congress
                            itself proclaims it, as it no doubt will; when State legislatures
                            proclaim it everywhere as they ought; it will leave no room to doubt
                            these resolutions will reach the ears of Southern men, and disarm the
                            rebel leaders who are everywhere instilling it into the minds of the
                            people South that this war is begun by the Abolitionists for the purpose
                            of murdering their women and children, stirring up servile insurrection
                            -
                        Mr. ANTHONY, [interrupting.] Should not we say that it is not for the
                            purpose of destroying their women and children?
                        Mr. RAY. There is no use of going into that extent of detail. We simply
                            desire to say that the object of the war is not a political or
                            anti-slavery one, not a sectional one, but one in which the government
                            intends to assert its authority, and maintain its honor throughout the
                            entire length of the land. It is sufficient for the government to
                            declare to the people everywhere the flag of invasion goes the object is
                            not to infringe, but maintain all rights under the Constitution.
                        Mr. MILLER. I am in favor of passing these resolutions just as they were
                            reported from the House, as I remarked the other day. Now there is no
                            particular reason for going into the details. If the Administration only
                            prosecutes this war as it ought to, and march down upon these rebels,
                            its purposes will be shown by its acts. I undertake to say there is more
                            assurance given the Southern Union men in the proclamation recently
                            issued by that noble soldier, Gen. McClellun, than in such resolutions
                            as these passed by the Legislatures of all i he Northern States, in
                            which he emphatically declares to the people that it is the settled
                            policy of the administration not to prosecute this war for the purpose
                            of subjugation, but. to sustain the people of the South against those
                            who attempt to uproot this Government; that it is not the intention to
                            seek the abolition of slavery by force or otherwise.
                        Mr. SLACK, [interrupting.] Why will you not express these sentiments in
                            these resolutions?
                        Mr. MILLER. Because it is unnecessary. A man might come to you and say "I
                            am not going to steal your horses; I will not break in your barn and
                            take out your grain; I am an honest man;" and you would suspect him at
                            once of being an arch felon.
                        Mr. SLACK. But suppose I charge the man with the intention, I ask if it
                            would not proper for him to disclaim it? That is all we ask here.
                        Mr. MILLER. Who makes the charges?
                        Mr. SLACK. The Secessionists.
                        Mr. MILLER. Then it is to appease the wrath of the rebels that, you want.
                            I will see them in hell before I will do any such thing. The Union men
                            do not charge upon the Administration any such purposes, and I not care
                            what the Secessionists charge, would charge them with the bayonet in
                            return for their charges.
                        Mr. SLACK. Why don't you volunteer?
                        Mr. MILLER. I don't know but what I shall. If I should I wonder where I
                            will find the Senator from Huntington - whether with me or against me.
                            But it is not necessary for this government to declare we are not going
                            to do wrong. It is not necessary for a woman to go round and declare her
                            virtue, for if she does some man may suspect her.
                        A VOICE. "And act according." [Laughter.]
                        Mr. MILLER. Yes, and act accordingly. But I understand these rebels are
                            in open war against us, and I am not for doing anything to appease their
                            wrath. The fact is I want to see them whipped, and I would not do
                            anything to stop them in their career. We will have no peace until these
                            men are crushed.
                        Mr. RAY. I would ask the gentleman whether the declarations that the
                            South must be whipped out, and other declarations of that kind; whether
                            they do not give the rebels an argument and a powerful weapon to use
                            upon the quiet, conservative, Union men of the South?
                        Mr. MILLER. I did not say the South should be whipped out. I said
                            Southern traitors should be whipped. I do not charge every man South
                            with being a traitor, for I believe there are some as good Union men
                            South as there are North, and I believe some South are better than a
                            great many that we have North.
                        Mr. SLACK. But what is the harm in adopting this amendment?
                        Mr. MILLER. It gives, as an expression of this Legislature, that they
                            doubt the purposes of the administration of Abraham Lincoln; and I am
                            not willing to do that to satisfy any Southern secessionists, or
                            Northern secessionists either. I do not believe there is a Union man
                            within the borders of the United States  who believes that it is the purpose of the
                            United States to abolish slavery by force of arms.
                        Mr. RAY. Does not the gentleman believe the whole thing has been carried
                            through by fraud upon the conservative, quiet people of South by a
                            conspiracy of secession eaders deceiving and humbugging the people,
                            making them believe it is an administration policy to interfere with
                            their domestic affairs?
                        Mr. MILLER. That may be true. And I think they may have had allies in the
                            North. I believe the purpose of those who are in rebellion was to
                            establish a Southern Confederacy - a government of their own ; not that
                            they believed the people of the North ever intended to abolish slavery
                            without, their consent, but that they might put slavery on a surer
                            foundation; and that they might have the control of the offices of that
                            government, it is now, in a few years longer, the North will control
                            this government, and as a consequence the public offices will be mostly
                            filled by Northern men.
                        Mr. RAY. Does not the Senator believe that the reign of terror has been
                            such as to intimidate the Union men; who would, if they had some
                            argument or some means by which they could defend the administration,
                            they might be able to stem the tide against them?
                        Mr. MILLER. The only argument you can give the Union men of the South is
                            the Minnie rifle and the cannon; but a corrupt administration placed the
                            arms of this government in the hands of traitors. They have the arms and
                            the Union men are without arms, find can not defend themselves. Until
                            the Union men are supported by force of arms you need not talk of any
                            argument. That argument is the only one that will avail them, and it
                            ought to be given them. These resolutions imply that our members of
                            Congress shall do this, and vote men and money to crush out this
                            infernal rebellion. Why declare that we are going to act high-minded and
                            not interfere with the institution of slavery, when we have never
                            threatened it? I am opposed to it.
                        Mr. CLAYPOOL withdrew his amendment to the amendment.
                        Mr. MELLETT offered the following amendment to the amendment:
                        Amend by adding: "Nor for the purpose of preventing the escape of
                            fugitive slaves, or in any manner to aid, foster or protect the
                            institution of slavery."
                        Mr. JOHNSTON moved to lay this amendment on the table.
                        Mr. MELLETT. I desire to explain. I suppose the object of the gentleman
                            is to sustain and build up slavery. I shall vote against the motion to
                            lay upon the table because I do not believe it is right to vote men or
                            money in the Northern States to go to the Southern States for the
                            purpose of protecting and building up or sustaining the institution of
                            slavery.
                        Mr. ANTHONY. I would like to further amend by inserting: " Nor for the
                            purpose of murdering women and children, stealing their property, or
                            committing any other kind of felony."
                        The PRESIDENT (to the Secretary.) Call the roll.
                        Mr. RAY. I have to explain my vote by saying that if I thought the
                            amendment was offered with any sincerity, I would be very willing to
                            have it go along with these resolutions, for it meets my approbation;
                            but seeing it is offered with a view to effect the amendments by
                            levity
                        Mr. MELLETT (interrupting ) The object is simply to water down the
                            amendment.
                        Mr. MARCH. I am satisfied with the report of the committee; expect to
                            vote for the resolutions, and see no necessity for amending them at all.
                            I think they cover the whole ground I shall vote to lay this on the
                            table with the intention of voting down the other also.
                        The amendment was laid on the table by yeas 33, nays 10.
                        Mr. CLAYPOOL offered the following:
                        Amend by substituting for the amendment offered by the Senator from
                            Huntington: ''That we fully and cordially approbate and indorse the
                            policy of the Administration in its efforts to put down the rebelion now
                            existing in certain States of the Union, and to amend the resolution by
                            striking out the following words: return to the people.'"
                        Mr. CLAYPOOL. My object is simply to harmonize the feelings of gentlemen
                            upon this floor, and suppose this substitute will meet, their views. If
                            the resolutions simply contemplate endorsing the policy of the
                            administration this amendment is just the thing.
                        Mr. RAY. I am not presumptions enough to claim to be in the confidence of
                            this administration and know nothing about its policy, except what I
                            gather from the proclamation of the President and his Generals in the
                            field. I would not endorse the policy of the administration without
                            -
                        Mr. NEWBOMB (interposing.) I refer the gentleman to the proclamation of
                            the President when calling out these troops. I am satisfied no citizen
                            of Indiana is better informed as to the policy of the administration
                            than the gentleman from Shelby, [Mr. Ray.] If I vote to-day to approbate
                            the policy of the administration, I vote to approbate that policy up to
                            this time; but no vote could be construed into an approbation of a
                            policy that might be pursued hereafter.
                        Mr. RAY. I have on no occasion endorsed the policy of this
                            administration. I do not wish to be understood as endorsing the policy
                            of an administration without knowing what it is. I suppose this war has
                            for its object to put down rebellion and maintain the federal authority
                            throughout the States, but if the administration has a different policy
                            I do not endorse it.
                        Mr. CLAYPOOL. Then it would be easy for the gentleman to put himself on the record
                            without the amendment. But it is the studied policy of the gentleman to
                            make a declaration of what is not the policy of the administration. He
                            dare not disapprove of the resolutions as they came from the committee,
                            but he wishes to adopt, a negative. He wants us to say as Senators, "we
                            do not approve of the prosecution of this war for negative purposes,
                            when no sane man -
                        Mr. RAY (interposing.) Why not say so?
                        Mr. CLAYPOOL. Why not say it is not prosecuted for a thousand other
                            purposes? Now, sir, Senators have intimated that the object of this
                            resolution was simply to endorse the policy already inaugurated by the
                            administration. I want to see Senators respond to the amendment I
                            proposed. I have no objection to voting upon any single isolated
                            proposition gentlemen may choose to make, but I want gentlemen to vote
                            squarely upon the proposition that we do approve the policy of this
                            administration in reference to putting down rebellion. The substitute I
                            offered does not go any farther. Any attempt to incorporate into these
                            resolutions any opinion has a tendency to arouse former political
                            associations, and will no doubt produce recriminations both upon one
                            side and the other. If the gentleman wants to endorse the policy of the
                            administration let him do so in round terms.
                        Mr. TARKINGTON. I did not think that the amendment offered by the Senator
                            from Huntington, [Mr. Slack] or when it was offered by the Senator from
                            Shelby [Mr. Ray] the other day, that it would produce any discussion. I
                            had supposed that as far as Indiana was concerned it was understood that
                            we were loyal and desired to prosecute this war to the farthest extent
                            against traitors. But I am compelled to come to the conclusion that
                            there is not much in the argument against a negative being inserted. I
                            find the President in his proclamation declares a negative; and when I
                            look at a late proclamation by a distinguished general from the State of
                            Ohio [McClellan] I find a negative declared there, and if it be
                            intention of this government to prosecute this war for the causes
                            Senators say are legitimate, I can not see, when a portion of this
                            country declare the object to be different from what we do, why we
                            should not declare it in black and white. Gentlemen seem to desire to
                            carry out their negative to every thing where there is but one
                            legitimate issue. There is but one, and gentlemen can not shut their
                            eyes to the fact that it is upon the question of slavery. The
                            distinguished Andrew Johnson is now canvassing the State of Tennessee,
                            and what is his purpose? It is to convince the people that this
                            administration is not intending to carry on this war for the purpose of
                            destroying the institutions of the South, but for a loyal purpose. Now,
                            if he is canvassing the State for that purpose, and it is his object to
                            uphold the Union men and get the Union men to rally round their standard
                            could there be any objection to strengthening his hands by the passage
                            of this amendment? When Andrew Johnson meets one of those large crowds
                            and he asserts this, suppose he reads to them a resolution of the Senate
                            of Indiana, declaring this is not the purpose of the war, and says: "I
                            ask you to stand by the Union sentiment of the State of Tennessee,"
                            would not cause the Union men there to rally around that Senator more
                            than they now do? Certainly it would. Gen. McClellan says in his
                            proclamation to the people of Virginia: "Not-withstanding all that has
                            been said by the traitors to induce you to believe that our advent among
                            you will be signalized by interference with your slaves, understand one
                            thing clearly, not only will we abstain from all such interference, but
                            we will, on the contrary, with an iron hand crush any attempt at
                            insurrection on their part;" and we say, "notwithstanding what the
                            traitors say to you we declare to the contrary.''
                        Mr. MILLER. Does not this amendment imply doubt that Lincoln and
                            McClellan will make good these pledges they have made?
                        Mr. TARKINTON. I do not think so. The great thing is they charge upon us
                            that the administration is in favor of that, and we want simply to
                            strengthen the Union men by declaring that we are not. I do not believe
                            there is a Senator who will vote against this amendment that is in favor
                            of making such a declaration. Now why not let this be a unanimous vote?
                            I did not intend to make any remarks, but it struck me that Senators who
                            perhaps had prepared themselves to speak had better consider this view
                            of the matter.
                        Mr. LINE. We are on the eve of closing this session, and I think we had
                            better pass over this matter till Saturday or to-morrow at 10
                            o'clock.
                        VOICES. "No, no;" "no," "vote;" "no;" "let's take a vote."
                        Mr. STEELE. I have not troubled the Senate much lately; I think I have
                            not been on the floor more than once or twice this week; but upon this
                            occasion I would like to say two or three words, and then the Senate can
                            take any action it chooses. In saying that, I am very sorry to differ
                            with a great majority of my own political friends on this floor upon
                            this question, I do not, sir, think this amendment proposed by the
                            Senator from Huntington, [Mr Slack] will have at all the effect that the
                            Senator from St. Joseph, [Mr. Miller] says it will. I think, if it has
                            any effect at all, it will have an entire contrary effect; and, as the
                            Senator from Monroe [Mr. Tarkington] has said, it will quiet the minds
                            of the people. What is the cause of the popularity of that famous
                            address to the people of Virginia, by Gen. McClellan. It is because it
                            breathes forth the sentiments of the people of this country. It shows to
                            the people of Virginia, as he goes to them with an army of 80,000 men.
                            the  be easy for purposes for which
                            he goes, and that they are not what are announced by the traitors of the
                            South. It shows those people that the intention of that powerful army
                            under his command if not for to subjugate Virginia, or to interfere in
                            any way with her domestic institutions, but he, upon the contrary,
                            declares that he will use that army with an iron hand to crush any
                            rebellion that may be raised there amongst their slaves, if necessary.
                            This address will be read with pleasure by all Union men in Western
                            Virginia. It gives them an argument to use against those secessionists
                            and demagogues that are there and everywhere else trying to convince
                            those deluded people that this war is made for no other purpose than
                            subjugation and abolition. Now look at yesterday's Louisville Journal, and see that celebrated letter of Governor
                            Morehead, in which he asks the question, "What has Lincoln raised an
                            army of 250,000 men for, if it is not for subjugation and the abolition
                            of slavery in all the South." Now, if we refuse this amendment, the
                            people of Kentucky and the South would have some cause to believe that
                            Governor Morehead's assertion was true; but pass it, and it gives the
                            lie to all such assertions. It shows officially where we stand in
                            Indiana. It will give our Union men in Kentucky an argument that will
                            have some weight. How is it now they have rio declaration from us?
                            Resolutions introduced here by myself, and passed unanimously by this
                            body, breathing the same spirit, have not been sent there, as they were,
                            for some cause or other, reconsidered in the other branch, and they lay
                            there upon the table. I can say to Senators that I apprehend no danger
                            in making a frank declaration of my purposes for prosecuting the war: it
                            is for the perpetuity of this glorious Union, the maintenance of the
                            Constitution, and enforcement of the laws. I hope the amendment will be
                            adopted. Why, sir, who is to be believed on this occasion? Who are the
                            persons that the people of Kentucky are to believe? Is it the Hon. Gov.
                            Morehead, that has been a favorite and a bosom friend of Henry Clay for
                            50 years, when he states that, the intention of this administration is
                            openly and avowedly for the subjugation of that country, and for the
                            abolition of slavery? He declares it to be so, and there is a man that
                            has stood as high as any man in the State of Kentucky that declares
                            this. The people have been in the habit of believing him for a great
                            many years. Or are they to believe their Governor? What have those men
                            who stand by the Union got to testify that Indiana is not waging this
                            war for these very purposes? Sir, I had here a Southern paper, and I
                            have been hunting for it, in which was printed the resolutions I
                            introduced here the other day, containing this same sentiment; one of
                            the papers in Kentucky had printed these resolutions, and said Indiana
                            had failed to pass resolutions against waging War for -
                        Mr. MILLER, (interposing.) If a man were to call you a thief, what would
                            you do?
                        Mr. STEELE. That is not the question in this matter. I do not call in
                            question the motives of that Senator or any other Senator, but sir, for
                            the purposes I have stated, I shall vote for the amendment. There is no
                            harm in it it can do me no harm to say to my friends in
                            Kentucky that I am not waging a war for the subjugation of their slaves.
                            But, if gentlemen do vote against these resolutions, the Senate of
                            Indiana will not pass a resolution saying we are not waging a war for
                            that purpose, and what effect will it have? Pass these, and they can say
                            to their neighbors, "Here is what this army is for; it is not to cut our
                            throats, but to sustain the pure American government and the flag of our
                            country. I vote willingly and cordially for the amendment of the Senator
                            from Huntington.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. The object of these resolutions is not for the purpose of
                            endorsing any general policy. They are instructions, and to make
                            instructions effective they must go through this Legislature with some
                            degree of unanimity. If we get up questions that find us nearly equally
                            divided, they will have no effect. Now, what is the amendment of the
                            Senator from Huntington? It is, that this war shall not be waged "for
                            any sectional, political or anti-slavery purpose." How can any war be
                            waged without a political purpose or object? The thing is absurd on its
                            face.
                        Mr. WOLFE. I think the Senator will modify his amendment in that
                            particular.
                        Mr. SLACK. Most assuredly so.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. Well, sir, as I remarked, we must have these resolutions go
                            through with some unanimity, if they are to be effective at all. Now, we
                            have got a great deal of business to do which has to be done to-day; but
                            rather than have this debate go on I would prefer very much to see these
                            resolutions go by the board. Let us take up our legitimate business now,
                            and to-morrow take up these resolutions, when we can transact no other
                            business. I move to lay the whole subject on the table.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS demanded a division of the question.
                        The PRESIDENT. I do not know how you can divide a subject matter. To
                            avoid consumption of time the Chair will hold that the proposition is
                            not divisible.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS. Permit the Senator from Knox to appeal from that
                            decision.
                        The PRESIDENT. Certainly, if the Senator desires to take up the time of
                            the Senate.
                        Mr. STUDABAKER. I would suggest that this matter be made a special order
                            for tomorrow.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. Certainly.
                        VOICES. "No consent." "Consent." "Consent."
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. There being objection, I shall insist on my motion.
                        
                        Mr. RAY. If the amendment of the gentleman from Fayette [Mr. Claypool]
                            were restricted, it would do. I think the Senate can come to an
                            understanding in two minutes.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS now submitted his appeal in writing, to-wit: "The Chair
                            having decided the question under debate - being a motion to lay the
                            whole subject matter on the table not divisible, from that decision I
                            appeal."
                        The question being, shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment
                            of the Senate, it was so decided by yeas 26, nays 15.
                        The "whole subject matter" was then laid on the table by yeas 22, nays

                            DOCKET FEES.
                            The Senate refused to concur in the amendments of the House to Mr.

                            Mr. WILLIAMS offered the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, By the Senate, the House
                                            concurring, that the Governor be authorized to settle
                                            with, and pay to the State Board of Agricul-  ture for the use of, and
                                            damage done to the State Fair Grounds by the troops of
                                            the State and the United States, to be paid out of any
                                            money in the Treasury appropriated to defray the
                                            expenses of the war.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. MARCH made an ineffectual motion to amend by striking out all in
                                the resolution relating to the "use" of the grounds.
                            The resolution was rejected by yeas 13, nays 24.
                        
                        
                            ADUANCE PAY TO VOLUNTEERS.
                            Mr. WHITE offered the following joint resolution, [Senate, No. 10,]:
                            [This resolution was subsequently withdrawn with the intention of
                                again offering it to-morrow.
                            Mr. WHITE. Yesterday there was a similar resolution passed, but I
                                understand it does not meet the case. By the resolution which passed
                                yesterday I understand the officers and men each get five dollars.
                                The officers say that is nothing at all. It don't meet their
                                expenses in any shape or manner. The officers, I am told, are
                                compelled to loan a great deal of money to the men. In a few days
                                the wages due them by the government will be ready to be paid in,
                                and this is but a loan to the officers to meet their current
                                expenses.
                            The resolution was adopted by yeas 27, nays 7.
                        
                        
                            DISTRIBUTION OF THE SCHOOL FUND.
                            Mr. LINE, from the Committee on Education,
                                submitted the following:
                            WHEREAS, The auditors of several counties of the State have failed to
                                make their reports to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction
                                as required by the school law, passed at the last regular session of
                                the General Assembly of Indiana - thereby preventing the
                                Superintendent from making his distribution of the school fund
                                equitably, by the time such distribution was required to be made by
                                law; therefore,
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That we approve of the delay
                                            of the Superintendent in making said distribution until
                                            said county auditors have made their reports as required
                                            by law.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That it is of the highest
                                            importance to the educational interests of Indiana, that
                                            every public officer connected with the school law,
                                            either directly or remotely, should be prompt in the
                                            discharge of his official duty.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolutions were adopted.

                            On Mr. MILLER'S motion the highway bill [H. R. 57] was read the third
                                time.
                            The bill failed to pass - yeas 15, nays 21 - for want of a
                                constitutional majority, (26.)
                            The Senate then took a recess till 7 1/2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            NIGHT SESSION.
                            On motion by Mr. CONLEY, the Auditor's labor-saving bill, [H. R. 48] which failed for want of a
                                constitutional majority this afternoon, was again put upon its
                                passage on a recount.
                            The bill then passed by yeas 26, nays 11.

                            
                                GENERAL APPROPRIATIONS.
                                The general appropriation bill, [H. R. 60] which also failed for
                                    want of a constitutional majority, was taken up and passed by
                                    yeas 34 nays 14.

                                Mr. March's bill [S. 51] was read the third time and finally
                                    passed by yeas 34, nays 2.
                            
                            
                                THE MILITIA
                                The militia bill [H. R. 63] was read the third time and passed by

                                Mr. MILLER objecting in a few words: because a clause in the bill
                                    made this action look like the Legislature had lost confidence
                                    in the Governor.
                                Mr. DEHART came into the chamber as the vote was being taken and
                                    voted without understanding the question. He did not think it
                                    right to remain upon the record wrong, and for that reason he
                                    moved to reconsider the vote just taken.
                                On motion by Mr, COBB - yeas 20, nays 19 - this motion was laid
                                    on the table. The following is the vote:

                                    amendments thereto.
                                On motion by Mr. CAMPBELL, section 41 of the bill was amended by
                                    allowing John W. While $3 extra for serving a writ for the
                                        Commissary investigating committee.
                                Mr. CONNER moved to strike out the section subscribing for six
                                    hundred copies of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                                After debate by Messrs. Conner, Ray, DeHart, Studabaker,

                                Mr. MARCH moved to reduce the pay of Doorkeepers to $3 per
                                    day.
                                This motion was laid on the table by yeas 22, nays 20.
                                Mr. MARCH moved to reduce the pay of the pages to $2 per day.
                                On motion by Mr. CONLEY - yeas 21, nays 20 - this motion was laid
                                    on the table.
                                Mr. RAY made an ineffectual motion to increase the amount to be
                                    paid the Secretaries for indexing the journal to $75 each.
                                On motion by Mr. JOHNSTON, the amount as increased to $50
                                    each.
                                The other committee amendments were severally concurred in.
                                Other amendments were made and rejected, when -
                                Mr. STUDABAKER demanded the previous question.
                                The demand was seconded by thirty Senators.
                                The bill then finally passed by yeas 31, nays 10.
                            
                            
                                PAPER, PENS, PENCILS, ETC.
                                The PRESIDENT laid before the Senate a report from the State
                                    Librarian of the number of sheets of paper, quills, pens,
                                    pencils, &c,, drawn by each member and officer.
                                And then the Senate adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            THURSDAY, May 30, 1861.
                        
                        The House met at nine o'clock, A. M.
                        The reading of the journal of yesterday was dispensed with.
                        
                            ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC APPROPRIATION BILL.
                            The House resumed the consideration of the additional specific
                                appropriation bill.
                            The proposition to make the pay of the Door keepers $4 a day was
                                rejected - yeas 24, nays 57.
                            Sundry amendments were proposed and received action, embracing
                                various specific claims.
                            Mr. FISHER proposed an additional section, allowing to A. E. & W.
                                H. Drapier for 600 of the Brevier Reports as per contract with the
                                Doorkeeper under a resolution of the House adopted April 29th,
                                $498.
                            It was adopted by consent.
                            On motion by Mr. LANE, the $4 a day compensation of the Clerks of the
                                House of Representatives was reconsidered and reduced again to $3 a
                                day.
                            On motion by Mr. CASON, because the following named clerks, viz: N.
                                P. Newkirk, James Gower and J. P. Smith served the Commissary and
                                Quartermaster special committee in the recess, it was ordered that
                                they receive each $4 a day.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG submitted an additional resolution to the effect that
                                the Auditor and Treasurer of State be authorized to allow, out of
                                the swamp land fund, to N. F. Cunningham one fourth of one per cent,
                                on the amount of that fund by him received, and one-fourth of one
                                per cent, on the amount by him disbursed - the same as heretofore
                                allowed.
                            It was rejected.
                            Mr. PACKARD made an ineffectual motion to raise the compensation of
                                J. H. Mathes and J. P. Johnson, Principal and Principal Assistant
                                Doorkeepers, to $4 a day.
                            The bill was then ordered to be engrossed.
                        
                        
                            PAYMENT OF THE TROOPS.
                            The SPEAKER, (Mr. Bundy in the chair,) laid before the House the
                                following special message from the Governor:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, May
                                            30,1861.
                                        
                                            To the House, of Representatives:
                                        
                                        I trust the Legislature will not adjourn without making
                                            any provision for the payment of the troops. The duties
                                            of paymaster are onerous and responsible, requiring the
                                            keeping of complicated accounts, and the disbursement of
                                            large sums of money. These duties are not now devolved
                                            on any officer, and if they should be conferred by the
                                            Governor upon any person, a bond taken for the faithful
                                            performance of the duties, would be without authority of
                                            law, and therefore void. As the law now stands,
                                            the-money could not be drawn from the treasury in large
                                            sumsta pay the regiments stationed at distant
                                            points.
                                        
                                            O. P. MORTON,
                                            Governor.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                            The message was referred to the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary.
                        
                        
                            THE NORTHERN PRISON.
                            On the motion of Mr. STOTSENBERG, Mr. Veatch's Northern Prison bill
                                    [39] was taken up the
                                question being on the third reading. He desired to offer an
                                amendment. It was proposed to send 200 convicts there from the
                                Southern Prison, and there are already there 120 convicts, which
                                will make over 300 convicts to be taken care of and employed. Power
                                was given in the bill to the Warden to employ a competant mechanic
                                to direct the labor, but there was no provision for a general
                                superintendent of work. He therefore asked unanimous consent to
                                insert a provision that be employed as such superintendent. The
                                amendment was read as follows:
                            Insert at the end of the 2d section: "And for the purpose of having
                                said work properly and economically done --- is hereby appointed
                                Superintendent of the work and labor to be done and performed in and
                                about said prison by the citizen mechanics and convict laborers, at
                                an annual compensation of one thousand dollars.
                            Mr. JENKINSON. I object.
                            The SPEAKER. The objection excludes it.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG proposed to strike out the "$8,000" item for said
                                Northern prison for 1861, and insert "$12,000."
                            It was also objected to.
                            Mr. FURGUSON proposed that, instead of removing those two hundred
                                convicts to the Northern prison, they be detailed for the military
                                service of the State. ["Order," "order."]
                            The SPEAKER. The gentleman is not in order.
                            
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. I ask unanimous consent to insert the word
                                "required" in appropriate connection in the clause for the removal
                                of those two hundred convicts.
                            It was agreed to by unanimous consent.
                            Mr.SHERMAN. There is no provision for taking care of these prisoners
                                for the year 1862. I ask unanimous consent to fill the blank in the
                                bill for that year with "30,000."
                            SEVERAL VOICES. "No," "no."
                            Mr. SHERMAN. What then are we to do with them? Shall we turn them
                                loose upon society? I hope none will concur with the gentleman from
                                Morgan, [Mr. Ferguson] in disgracing our troops by a proposition to
                                put them into the military service. ["Order," "order."]
                            Mr. FRASIER. Will the House admit $20,000? ["No consent."]
                            On motion by Mr. FISHER, (by unanimous consent,) the "$3" a day
                                compensation for the skillful mechanics authorized to be employed on
                                the prison, was made "$2" a day.
                            Mr. DAVIS. If I understand aright the House refuses to fill the blank
                                for 1862.
                            Mr. ORR. I understand from gentlemen behind me, that they will hear
                                to no filling up.
                            The bill was then passed the final reading in House of
                                Representatives - yeas 72, nays 3.
                        
                        
                            PAYMASTER GENERAL.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN,(Mr. Bundy in the chair,) There is no medium for
                                the payment of the troops in the military service of the State. To
                                supply this, I desire to introduce a bill.
                            There being no objection -
                            Mr. ALLEN introduced a bill [70] providing for the appointment of a Paymaster, (to the
                                six regiments, and also to the State militia when called into actual
                                service,) defining his duties, and providing punishment for any
                                violation thereof. [To be appointed by the Governor, with an animal
                                compensation of $800.]
                            The bill was read twice, under a dispensation, and considered on the
                                second reading.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. I move to strike out "$800," and insert
                                "$1,000."
                            Mr. ALLEN. I inserted that without consulting any one. It requires a
                                man of good business capacity, and he must enter into bonds of
                                $50,000. I doubt whether we can get a competent man for $800. The
                                compensation in the regular army service is $2,200. As I commenced
                                drafting the bill I was giving to the Paymaster the same rank and
                                the same compensation of the Paymaster in the regular service.
                            Mr. ORR. How many regiments does the Paymaster in the United States
                                service attend to?
                            Mr. ALLEN. My impression is that it is one regiment, and he must pay
                                out the money wherever the troops are. He must go where the troops
                                are, and take from each man his receipt on the pay roll. I think the
                                compensation ought to be at least $1,000.
                            Mr. RAGAN proposed to amend the amendment by inserting $1,500.
                            Mr. PACKARD. I move to lay the amendments on the table.
                            On a division Mr. Ragan's amendment was tabled, but the motion was
                                rejected with respect to the other, and Mr. Stotsenberg's
                                proposition was agreed to.
                            Mr. ALLEN. In section 3, the bill reads: It shall be the duty of said
                                paymaster to pay the troops. I propose to add here what I neglected
                                in the draft, these words, "or militia when in active service."
                            The modification was adopted by consent.
                            Mr. LANE. What amount of money is it probable would be in the
                                paymaster's hands at any one time?
                            Mr. ALLEN. I suppose that, at the time of paying the six regiments,
                                he may have $25,000 in his hands. I suppose never more than that.
                                The payments to be made monthly. Three of the six regiments have
                                entered the service of the United States. The payments to them are
                                to be made immediately upon the time of their going into the service
                                of the United States. The bill provides that as soon as they go out
                                of the service of the State, thereupon his services as to them will
                                cease.
                            Mr. KNOWLTON. Then he remains paymaster to those that remain in the
                                State service.
                            Mr. ALLEN. Yes; and to the militia.
                            Mr. KNOWLTON. But suppose the State troops and militia go out, then
                                he will be paymaster to nobody.
                            Mr. ALLEN. Yes. But could you get a man to accept the position,
                                conditioned upon the continuance of our military organizations?
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Without a paymaster, there would be nobody to make any
                                payments at all to the troops.
                            Mr. PACKARD. Mr. Speaker: When we passed the militia bill, we did not
                                think it worth while to create this officer with a salary of a
                                thousand dollars. If the bill can be amended so as to provide that
                                his office shall cease as soon as the troops are retired from active
                                service, I will go for it. But we cannot go for a measure to fix up
                                salaried officers to be paid out of the Military fund.
                            Mr. GRESHAM showed that the $70,000 militia fund was not to be
                                touched for this. He showed where that was to go.
                            Mr. PACKARD. Then the most of it was to be paid to commissioned
                                officers.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Will the gentleman tell us what militia officer in the
                                State is paid anything?
                            Mr. PACKARD. I want the House to vote understandingly in this matter
                                with the understanding that this officer is an officer for life, if
                                he shall behave himself well.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN. On consultation with those who desire the passage
                                of this bill, but are opposed to indefiniteness as to the term of
                                office, I desire to have unanimous consent to offer the following:
                                "And shall hold his office for the term of two years."
                            It was adopted by unanimous consent.
                            Mr. ORR. Is this bill an answer to the Governor's message of this
                                morning?
                            The SPEAKER assented. The final vote was reported - yeas 70, nays
                                8.
                        
                        
                            COMMISSARY AND QUARTERMASTER DEPARTMENT.
                            Mr. FISHER, from the Committee on Ways and Means,
                                returned the bill [S. 60] providing for the manner of procuring, and
                                the quality of subsistence in the Commissary and Quartermaster
                                Department, prescribing the duty of certain of-  fleers, and prescribing punishment for
                                its violation, with an amendment, striking out the first and second
                                sections, and inserting to this effect:
                            1. The subsistence stores for the volunteer and military stores of
                                the State shall be procured by contract by the Commissary and
                                Quartermaster Generals notice for proposals to be advertised in the
                                Indianapolis and New Albany papers, and in a newspaper in the
                                vicinity where the supplies are to be obtained contract shall be
                                awarded to the lowest responsible bidder.
                            2. The Inspector General shall inspect all store she may reject
                                supples and if the contractor fail in the terms of the contract, he
                                shall notify the proper officer, who shall commence suit for
                                damages.
                            The amendment was adopted and ordered to be engrossed, and considered
                                as engrossed; and then the bill was passed the final reading in the
                                House of Representatives - yeas 70, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            PROSECUTING FEES.
                            Mr. CASON, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                returned the bill [S. 31] to
                                regulate the docket fees of district attorneys in the Court of
                                Common Pleas and before justices of the peace, and regulating
                                prosecuting and district attorney's fees on prosecuting forfeited
                                recognizances, with an amendment striking out after line five of
                                sec. 3, and all of sec. 3; and inserting to this effect: Sec. 3.
                                Said district attorney shall receive an annual salary of $300, (and
                                the fees herein provided,) to be paid out of the county treasury in
                                proportion to the number of taxable polls, &c.; and when so
                                amended, the committee recommended the passage of the bill.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. The Committee considered the fact, that the District
                                Attorneys have got no pay at all. Under the present common pleas
                                act, the burden of prosecutions for small offences is thrown on the
                                prosecutors in the common pleas court. This bill provides no salary
                                out of the State treasury, but out of the county treasury ; and that
                                the prosecutor shall have no fees in criminal cases where the
                                defendant is in solvent.
                            Mr. ATKISSON. How is that paid by the county?
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. In the ratio of the polls.
                            The amendment was concurred in; and then the vote was reported on the
                                final reading in the House of Representatives - yeas 56, nays
                                17.
                            So the bill passed.
                        
                        
                            ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC APPROPRIATION BILL.
                            On motion by Mr. FISHER, the additional specific appropriation bill
                                    [68] having been reported
                                as correctly engrossed, was taken up and passed the first reading in
                                the House of Representatives - yeas 71, nays 1.
                            The House then took a recess till two o'clock P. M.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            On motion of Mr. BUNDY, the court time bill [S. 24] in Owen county, was taken
                                up, and (under a dispensation) it was read twice and considered on
                                the second reading.
                            On his further motion it was considered as engrossed and passed the
                                third and last reading in the House of Representatives - yeas 70,
                                nays 1.
                            On motion by Mr. STOTSENBERG, the bill [S. 41] was considered on the
                                third reading.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. This was a bill to provide for cases where a party
                                executing a title bond, (it may be,) and dies without a will,
                                &c. This bill gives the Executor or Administrator the right to
                                make the deed, make the tender and the execution of the deed, and
                                that, in cases where the purchaser fails to comply with the
                                contract, suit may be instituted against him. It is to remedy a
                                defect in the present law.
                            Mr. FRASIER saw no necessity for the bill. The statutes of 1852
                                provided an ample remedy in all cases. No difficulty had arisen that
                                he ever heard of. The gentleman says it is to provide for the
                                enforcement of the contract of purchasers. Was not that done every
                                day by Executors and Administrators.
                            Mr. Speaker ALLEN. Could he sue without the tender of the deed? and
                                how could he tender the deed when the time for the execution of the
                                deed is passed?
                            Mr. FRASIER. Perhaps he could not. But after all, its the laches, or negligence of the contracting party.
                                There may be a greater necessity for the bill than I am aware of. It
                                should be well guarded against opportunities for collusions between
                                administrators and other parties.
                            Mr. BUNDY was sure that if the gentleman had read the bill, as a
                                lawyer, he must see the necessity for its passage.
                            The bill was passed the final reading - yeas 70, nays 0.

                            
                                LEVEES AND DRAINS.
                                Mr. HENRICKS, from the select committee thereon, returned his
                                    levees and drains bill [32], with an amendment inserting 4 sections.
                                2. The directors of such association, before making the
                                    assessment, shall cause a survey and estimate to be made of the
                                    cost of the proposed work. 3. Any person owning land to be
                                    affected by it, may sign the articles of association, or not, at
                                    pleasure. 4. The directors shall not have power to commence such
                                    work, nor let any part of the ditching, until they shall have
                                    been instructed so to do by a majority of the association. 5.
                                    Notices to be given in the newspaper of the county.
                                Mr. HENRICKS. The point in the amendment is to prevent parties
                                    from levying any more than is necessary to cut their drain.
                                    Under the old law, the levy was to be made in proportion to the
                                    value of the ditch to the property. This authorizes a pro rata
                                    assessment for the expense of the drain, with regard to the
                                    value of the drain to the land. In t other words, it is to
                                    prevent them from draining the owners of the land, instead of
                                    the land.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON. This bill would prevent all further draining by
                                    companies. If a majority of the land-owners are to govern, all
                                    ditching would be prevented. The vote of a man of 40 acres goes
                                    as far as the vote of a man of 4,000 acres. A few men could act
                                    with  efficiency, but large
                                    numbers of men, in such an enterprize, would never act.
                                Mr. FRASIER. Would the gentleman give the small land-owner into
                                    the power of the larger ones?
                                Mr. KNOWLTON. I think then, in such an association the vote
                                    should be in proportion to the amount of land they own. I would
                                    be willing that they should have votes according to the amount
                                    of land held, and the benefit they would derive from the drain.
                                    The small land-owners would defeat the object of the law.
                                Mr. HENRICKS. Our whole system is founded upon the principle that
                                    majorities shall govern; and now one of our gravest difficulties
                                    has grown up out of the opposite principle, that minorities
                                    shall govern. This bill is to prevent minorities from going on
                                    to make public ditches in defiance of the will of the
                                    majority.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON. It was to that very point I was speaking - that
                                    majorities shall govern - a majority in the interest.
                                Mr. HENRICKS. I am not willing to give to any man, because he
                                    happens to own a large amount of land, power to crush a
                                    poor-man.
                                The bill passed the final reading - yeas 74, nays 8.
                                On motion of Mr. FISHER, it was ordered that the enrolling clerk
                                    be authorized to employ an assistant.
                                On motion by Mr. ORR, the calendar of Senate messages was taken
                                    up.
                            
                            
                                COUNTY AUDITOR PENALTY.
                                The Senate joint resolution authorizing the Superintendent of
                                    Public Instruction to make the first apportionment of the school
                                    fund, without reference to the diminution of $100 by the 17th
                                    section of the school law, and relieving all counties from the
                                    penalty for the failure of their auditors to make the
                                    semi-annual reports before the first of April, was taken up.
                                That can only be done by passing a law. A resolution for such an
                                    object can have no effect whatever. I have good authority for
                                    that - the Auditor of State. He would not pay me under a
                                    resolution. I move to lay the joint resolution on the table.
                                The motion was rejected - yeas 81, nays 32.
                                Mr. BRETT. It is to relieve county auditors from the penalty of a
                                    law which many of them did not know was in force, and which, in
                                    some cases, it would have been impossible for them to comply
                                    with if they had known of it.
                                Mr. DAVIS. If we can take off the penalty it is our duty to do
                                    it.
                                Mr. EDSON. As there seems to be doubt as to whether a law can be
                                    suspended by a joint resolution, I move to refer this to the
                                        Judiciary Committee.
                                Mr. FISHER. I do not know whether the resolution can have the
                                    desired effect or not, but I am satisfied that the House should
                                    do something. I learn from the Superintendent of Public
                                    Instruction that some 25 or 30 counties have not been able to
                                    comply with that provision of the school law. Some of them, to
                                    avoid the liability, made partial returns before the 1st of
                                    April.
                                Mr. VEATCH. I do not believe that this resolution will relieve
                                    the auditors from any penalty. All that is to be effected by it,
                                    as I understand it, will be to authorize the non-action of the
                                    Superintendent of Public Instruction. The matter rests with the
                                    Superintendant. The law commands him, if the County Auditor
                                    fails to report, to deduct that amount of money in the
                                    distribution. But if the amount is not deducted, there will
                                    never be any occasion for collecting it. All that is requisite
                                    to accomplish what we desire, is to ask him to omit the
                                    deductions. There is a necessity for it. In many counties they
                                    could I not comply. In my county there was only a partial
                                    report.
                                Mr. HEFFREN. How could the gentleman give to the Superintendant
                                    his sanction of a violation of law?
                                Mr. VEATCH. I cannot; and I do not think that either by precept
                                    or example we are doing such a thing. We are not doing anything
                                    injurious. We are relieving the Superintendent from the
                                    necessity of relieving these penalties. Who will prosecute the
                                    Superintendant? None can but the State. Then, if you give this
                                    sanction, the same set of facts can never occur again under our
                                    amended legislation.
                                Mr. RAGAN. We ought to be careful that we do not lead men into
                                    temptation. I understand, sir, that the Superintendant of Public
                                    Instruction is sworn to obey the laws; and we ought not to place
                                    a temptation in the way of that officer to violate the laws and
                                    treat them with contempt.
                                Mr. VEATCH. When the gentleman quotes the Lord's Prayer, he
                                    should quote it complete. The remainder of the sentence
                                    is"deliver us from evil."
                                Mr. BRETT. I agree with the gentleman from Spencer [Mr. Veatch]
                                    in every word he has uttered. I can't see what possible harm the
                                    passage of a resolution of this kind can do. I suppose the
                                    Superintendant would be willing not to enforce the law, if this
                                    resolution can pass. Since no honor can grow out of it, why
                                    should we quibble about it? Even if the passage of the
                                    resolution should betray a lack of intelligence, or knowledge of
                                    the Constitution, it would not, I presume, be the first time
                                    such a display has been made here.
                                Mr. NEBEKER suggested that gentlemen here had voted without
                                    scruple for a similar joint resolution in regard to pay during
                                    the recess.
                                The joint resolution [88] was then passed the House of
                                    Representatives - yeas 69, nays 17.
                            
                            
                                INDIANA UNIVERSITY.
                                The bill [S. 34] to
                                    regulate the contingent fee on perpetual scholarships in the
                                    State University,  and
                                    providing for the purchase of the same, provided that they can
                                    be purchased at not more than 90 cents on the dollar, coming up,
                                    it was read twice under a dispensation of the rules.
                                Mr. VEATCH. There are but two points in the bill. One is to
                                    authorize the trustees to purchase in the perpetual scholarships
                                    for the purpose of completing the buildings and establishing the
                                    Institution. The other is, to fix the contingent fee on these
                                    perpetual scholarships at not more than one dollar per
                                    session.
                                Mr. PR0SSER. It seems to me, that there is a good deal of "French
                                    suffrage" in that bill.
                                The SPEAKER. It all belongs down there in Monroe county.
                                Mr. HEFFREN. Where will the money come from to buy these
                                    scholarships?
                                Mr. VEATCH. If they have money, they can buy, like other people,
                                    I suppose. ["All right."]
                                The bill was ordered to the third reading, read the third time
                                    and passed the House of Representatives - yeas 61, nays 20.
                            
                            
                                FRACTIONAL TOWNSHIP SCHOOL LAND.
                                The bill [S. 49] coming
                                    up, it was read twice under a dispensation of the rules, and
                                    considered on the second reading.
                                Mr. JONES, of Wayne. The present law for the sale of school lands
                                    requires that there shall be a vote, and that there shall be a
                                    majority of fifteen in the township in favor of it, before the
                                    school land can be sold. Now we have a fractional township in
                                    our county, which has but five voters in it; and they want to
                                    sell their school land, which cannot be done till the 54th and
                                    56th sections of the law shall be repealed. This bill proposes
                                    to do that.
                                Mr. ATKISSON. It seems te me that this bill gives too great
                                    latitude to the trustees. It says: "If the trustees are
                                    satisfied that a majority of the voters are agreed," &c.
                                Mr. BUNDY. I understand that the bill is drawn so that it will
                                    not probably apply to any other fractional township.
                                The bill was passed the final reading in the House of
                                    Representatives - yeas 71, nays 6.
                            
                            
                                GENERAL DISPENSATION.
                                On motion by Mr. GRESHAM, it was ordered, by yeas 73, nays 0,
                                    that there be a general dispensation of the rules and
                                    constitutional provision requiring each bill to be read and
                                    considered on separate days of the session, so as to enable the
                                    House to pass Senate bills through two readings, and finally, if
                                    desirable.
                            
                            
                                ELEVENTH CIRCUIT.
                                The eleventh circuit court bill [S. 22] was taken up, read
                                    twice and considered.
                                Mr. HALL objected, as conflicting with his common pleas court. He
                                    desired a reference to a select committee.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON. A bill of similar import has been before the Senate
                                    the whole session, and has been carefully prepared.
                                Mr. HALL said his county had not been consulted, and his Senator
                                    [Mr. Craven] protested against it.
                                It was referred to a select committee, namely: Messrs. Hall,
                                    Fisher and Knowlton.
                            
                            
                                MONTHLY PAY OF SALARIES.
                                The bill, [S. 23] providing for an increase of salaries, and
                                    providing a manner of reimbursing the State for an increase of
                                    salaries, (to be paid monthly is the only change,) was twice
                                    read.
                                Mr. BRETT. It could work no injury, and might be of advantage to
                                    the State officers. The embezzlement bill would not allow their
                                    official salaries monthly.
                                Mr. BUNDY could not see the necessity of this bill. Its passage
                                    would repeal the salary of the Adjutant and Quartermaster
                                    General.
                                Mr. McLEAN. Gentlemen may know that, prior to the passage of the
                                    embezzlement bill, the Treasurer was in the habit of advancing
                                    money on the salaries of the public officers. He thought the
                                    gentleman was right about its repeal of the salaries of Adjutant
                                    and Quartermaster General.
                                Mr. --- proposed to amend by inserting, after the 7th
                                    specification, "To the State Librarian, $800."
                                It was agreed to: and then -
                                On motion of Mr. HOPKINS, the bill was laid on the table.
                            
                            
                                JOSEPH MOORE.
                                The bill [S. 32] for the
                                    relief of Joseph Moore, was considered in its various stages,
                                    and passed the final reading in the House of Representatives -

                                COMMON PLEAS.
                                The bill [S. 36] to change
                                    the times of holding the common pleas courts in the counties of
                                    Beriton, White, Carroll and Tippecanoe, was considered in its
                                    various stages, and passed the final reading in the House of
                                    Representatives - yeas 76, nays 0.
                            
                            
                                COMBINATIONS FOR FELONY.
                                The bill [S. 37] defining
                                    what shall constitute certain felonies, and prescribing penalty
                                    therefor, was considered in its various stages.
                                Mr. FRASIER. Did it enlarge the existing law.
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN, [Mr. Davis in the Chair.] It was to meet such
                                    cases as that lately complained of in Martin county.
                                Mr. FRASIER was still at a loss to see any necessity for it. If
                                    there was anything there that could not be reached by the riot
                                    act, what was it?
                                Mr. ROBERTS. It punishes combinations for felony as felony
                                    itself. Then the particular offense is not required to be set
                                    forth in the indictment.
                                Mr. ALLEN. If it was not criminal to combine for felony and
                                    murder, in the name of common sense what was a crime? If the man
                                    were guilty, he should be put on his trial, no matter what is
                                    his character. He recited the case of lawlessness in Martin
                                    county.
                                Mr. FRASIER. Bullets and bayonets were the best there.
                                
                                Mr. ALLEN. It was preferable to punish them according to law.
                                Mr. FRASIER. His position was not that he would have the people
                                    take the law into their own hands, but the Governor could call
                                    out the militia.
                                Mr. ALLEN. It was a combination of men in various counties, but
                                    acting separately.
                                Mr. FRASIER. If it was a band of blacklegs, as long as they don't
                                    commit any act of felony, there is no felony; when they do, the
                                    whole party may be taken up and punished as accessories,
                                    &c.
                                Mr. BUNDY. Lawyers think it strange that the particular act shall
                                    not be set forth. He referred to indictments for riots and
                                    unlawful assemblies. From what he had heard from the south part
                                    of the State, he did not think there was a necessity for this
                                    act.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG demanded the previous question; and, under its
                                    pressure, the bill was passed the final reading in the House of
                                    Representatives - yeas 62, nays 16.
                            
                            
                                ELEVENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON, from the committee to which was referred the llth
                                    judicial circuit bill, [S. 22] returned the same and reported all right.
                                Mr. HALL said he was not yet satisfied with it.
                                Mr. THOMPSON stated that this bill would not make any conflict of
                                    courts.
                                Mr. FISHER. The only change in Grant county was that it made the
                                    courts one week earlier.
                                The bill was then passed the final reading in the House of
                                    Representatives - yeas 77, nays 2.
                            
                            
                                DECEDENTS' ESTATE BILL.
                                The decedents' estate bill, [S. 35 - amending the 21st section of
                                    the act of June 17, 1852,] was considered in the several stages,
                                    but failed on the final reading in the House of Representatives
                                    - yeas 42, nays 35 - for want of a constitutional majority of
                                    51.
                            
                            
                                RAILROADS.
                                The bill [S. 33] to amend sec. 34 of the act of May 11, 1852,
                                    providing for the incorporation of railroad companies, coming to
                                    the second reading -
                                On motion by Mr. PARRETT, it was laid on the table.
                            
                            
                                COMMISSARY AND QUARTERMASTER'S BOND.
                                The bill [S. 38] requiring
                                    commissaries and quartermasters to execute official bonds, and
                                    prescribing where they shall be filed, was considered in its
                                    various stages, and passed the final reading in the House of
                                    Representatives yeas 58, nays 19.
                                Mr. ROBBINS had leave of absence, on account of sickness in his
                                    family.
                            
                            
                                PARTITION OF ESTATES. PARTITION.
                                The descent and apportionment of estates bill [S. 39 - amendatory
                                    of the act of May 14, 1852, advancements to heirs shall be
                                    counted in the distribution,] was considered on the second
                                    reading.
                                Mr. GRESHAM. As the law now is, when an advance has been made to
                                    a child, it is thrown into the common fund, and such heir is to
                                    account for it in the distribution. In this way the widow
                                    sometimes takes the entire estate. The object is to remedy this
                                    defect. It is simply re-enacting the law of 1843.
                                Mr. THOMAS hoped it would pass.
                                It failed for want of a constitutional majority - yeas 49, nays
                                    30.
                                Mr. WOODHULL. If the heir has an advancement, it is so much the
                                    better for the heir. The widow gets one-third of the real
                                    estate, if there are two heirs, and three hundred dollars of the
                                    personal property, if there is so much. Indiana had liberal laws
                                    toward women, and he was unwilling to abridge their rights.
                                Mr. NEBEKER considered the law right, and the bill wrong.
                                Mr. PACKARD demanded the previous question, and, under its
                                    operation, the bill failed - yeas 43, nays 36.
                            
                            
                                STATE LIBRARY.
                                The bill [S. 53] to amend
                                    sections 11 and 24 of the act of May 27, 1852, regulating the
                                    duties of the State Librarian, coming up -
                                Mr. EDSON proposed to amend by inserting appropriately these
                                    words:
                                "All reviews, magazines, cyclopedias, books of reference of any
                                    kind, news and literary journals, in bound volumes or separate
                                    numbers, or any very costly and rare work."
                                He said: The bill provides that law books shall not be taken out
                                    of the library, and his amendment provides to add other books to
                                    the books which shall not be taken out.
                                The bill was ordered to the third reading, read the third time,
                                    and finally passed the House of Representatives - yeas 78, nays
                                    0.
                            
                            
                                DELINQUENT TAX LIST.
                                The bill [S. 46] to amend
                                    sections 123 and 136 of the assessment act of June 21, 1852, and
                                    to repeal sections 138, 139 and 140 of said act, was considered
                                    on the second reading.
                                Mr. BRETT stated that the House assessment bill had been defeated
                                    in the Senate. This was a meritorious bill. It did away with
                                    sending up here to the State Auditor a copy of the delinquent
                                    list, and it allows delinquent taxes at any time.
                                Mr. VEATCH. It was a good feature in the bill to dispense with
                                    the extra copy of the delinquent list. He supposed that in not
                                    one case in ten thousand did the Auditor look at it. An abstract
                                    was all that was necessary. A copy of the duplicate might as
                                    well be sent up.
                                The bill was passed the final reading in the House of
                                    Representatives - yeas 74, nays 4.
                                The House then took a recess till 71/2 o'clock P. M.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            NIGHT SESSION.
                            Mr. RAGAN, from the Committee on Education,
                                returned Mr. Atkison's school tax bill, [64] with a motion that it
                                be laid on the table.
                            Mr. HAWORTH, from the Committee on military
                                    Affairs, returned Mr. Hayes' resolution, recommending
                                that it be laid on the table.
                            These reports were concurred in.

                            
                                AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS.
                                On motion by Mr. BLACK, his bill [H. R. 68] to repeal that section
                                    of the statute requiring the assessor to return agricultural
                                    statistics, was taken up, and it was ordered to be
                                    engrossed.
                            
                            
                                SALARY BILL.
                                The salary bill [S. 43]
                                    was considered on the second reading.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG proposed to amend, by striking out the words "and
                                    district," so that the bill will apply to circuit
                                    prosecutors.
                                The amendment was adopted; and so the bill was ordered to the
                                    third reading.
                            
                            
                                DOCKET FEES.
                                On motion by Mr. BUNDY, the Senate message of non-concurrence in
                                    the amendment of the House to the docket fee bill, [S. 31] just reported by Mr.
                                    Brown, their Secretary, was taken up.
                                On motion by Mr. BUNDY, it was
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the House insists on
                                                its amendment.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Ordered, That the Clerk acquaint the Senate
                                    therewith: and Messrs. Bundy, Stotsenberg and Orr were appointed
                                    a committee of conference thereon.
                            
                            
                                THE MILITIA LAW.
                                Mr. HOLCOMB submitted the following, which was adopted:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the door-keeper be
                                                instructed to procure and distribute to the members
                                                of the House of Representatives their quota of
                                                copies of the militia law ordered by this House.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. FISHER. It will be recollected that certain other documents
                                    were ordered to be published with the militia law - the rules
                                    and articles of war, he believed, and certain of the army
                                    regulations of the United States. He understood that the militia
                                    law was printed, but that the printer was waiting to be
                                    furnished with the copy for the remainder of the order; which,
                                    when put together, would make quite a large book, and cost the
                                    State several hundred dollars. He would, therefore, propose and
                                    submit a resolution to dispense with all the printing in that
                                    order, except the militia law.
                                The resolution was adopted by consent.
                            
                            
                                MR. BINGHAM'S TRUST FUND BILL.
                                On motion of Mr. UNDERWOOD, the Senate message requesting the
                                    return of Bingham's trust and swamp land fund bill, [38] just
                                    reported; was taken up, and, thereupon, he moved that the House
                                    refuse to send the bill back.
                                Mr. FISHER stated the object of the Senate's request.
                                Mr. UNDERWOOD had understood that the bill had already been
                                    returned by the Clerk, without waiting for the order of the
                                    House. He feared that there was some hocus
                                        pocus about this, to get rid of an amendment.
                                Mr. FISHER. It would save trouble and time for them to ask for
                                    the return of the bill, and amend it. There was no hocus pocus
                                    about it.
                                Mr. UNDERWOOD. It was just as proper for the Senate to amend the
                                    bill as for the House. He understood that it was returned at the
                                    suggestion of the gentleman from Wabash.
                                Mr. FISHER. Yes. The House could not amend a Senate amendment. It
                                    was simply to avoid the formality and trouble of a
                                        committee of conference.
                                Mr. PROSSER. I can see nothing wrong in the course taken by the
                                    gentleman from Wabash. I move to lay the motion of the gentleman
                                    from Jay [Mr. Underwood] on the table.
                                This motion was agreed to; and then,
                                On the motion of Mr. FISHER, it was
                                Ordered, That the Clerk return the bill, No.
                                    38, to the Senate.
                            
                            
                                SHERIFF'S MILEAGE.
                                Mr. Kitchen's sheriff mileage bill [39] was considered, and
                                    passed the third and last reading in the House of
                                    Representatives - yeas 74, nays 0.
                            
                            
                                AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS.
                                Mr. Black's bill, [68] to
                                    repeal that section [73] of the statute which requires a return
                                    of agricultural statistics with the appraisement lists, was
                                    taken up and considered on the final reading, under a
                                    dispensation of the rules.
                                Mr. BUNDY doubted the propriety of the bill. These statistics
                                    were valuable, and if valuable we ought not to cast away the
                                    means of preserving them.
                                Mr. WOODHULL did not think these statistics were made available
                                    as they ought to be. He considered that they are not worth what
                                    they cost.
                                Mr. FISHER. If there was time he would like to see these
                                    statistics collected once in five years. But, as it was, it was
                                    perhaps best to repeal it. It had been ascertained that it cost
                                    the State $28,800 merely for the labor of the assessors on these
                                    statistics. This, taken with expense of printing, he doubted not
                                    made an annual expense to the State of $30,000.
                                The bill was passed the final reading in the House of
                                    Representatives - yeas 52, nays 15.
                            
                            
                                PUTNAM COMMON PLEAS.
                                The common pleas [S. 29]
                                    coming up under the general dispensation taken this afternoon
                                    -
                                Mr. LANE explained that this bill provides for putting off the
                                    common pleas for one month in his county, (Putnam) and for
                                    extending  the time one
                                    week. It did not interfere with any other county, in the
                                    district.
                                It was passed the final'reading in the House of Representatives -
                                    yeas 75, nays 0.
                            
                            
                                ATTORNEY-GENERAL BILL.
                                The Attorney-General bill [S. 40] was considered in the several stages (hereof,
                                    under the general dispensation this afternoon, and passed the
                                    final reading in the House of Representatives - yeas 59, nays
                                    12.
                                Mr. VEATCH, from the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary, returned Mr. Speaker Alien's bill [61]
                                    to increase the salary of the Attorney General, with a
                                    recommendation that the same ought to pass.
                                On motion by Mr. JENKINSON, it was laid on the table -
                                    affirmative 89, negative 23.
                            
                            
                                OLD PERRY COUNTY BUILDINGS AND POOR HOUSE
                                The old Perry county buildings-conveyance bill, [S. 27] with the engrossed
                                    amendments of the House of Representatives, coming up -
                                Mr. VEATCH stated that the terms and provisions of the bill apply
                                    to the county of Perry, to quiet the title to old county
                                    buildings in Rome, conveyed to the trustees of a seminary of
                                    learning, and it authorized the people to vote their county poor
                                    farm to that seminary of learning He asked unanimous consent to
                                    strike out section 3, which was inconsistent with the other
                                    provisions of the bill.
                            
                            
                                APPEALS IN PARTITION.
                                The partition bill [S. 48] was considered in the various stages
                                    thereof, under the dispensation of this afternoon.
                                On motion by Mr. FRASIER, it was laid on the table.

                                The bill [S. 55] (it exempts inability, membership of a fire
                                    company, and a membership of some company in the active
                                    militia,) was taken up in order.
                                On motion by Mr. PROSSER, it was laid on the table.
                            
                            
                                COUNTY AUDITORS AND TREASURERS.
                                The Senate amendments to Mr. Brett's Auditor's labor bill [48] were taken up.
                                The amendments were agreed to by unanimous consent.
                                And then the bill passed the final reading ing in the House of
                                    Representatives - yeas 75, nays 0.
                            
                            
                                STATE PRINTING DEFICIENCY.
                                The Senate amendment to the additional general appropriation bill
                                        [60] to cover that
                                    portion of the public printing done in the year 1860, for which
                                    there has been no appropriation, was concurred in.
                            
                            
                                SALARY OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.
                                Mr. BLACK moved to reconsider the vote by which Mr. Speaker
                                    Alien's bill [61] to increase the salary of the Attorney
                                    General, to $2,500, was laid on the table.
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN (Mr. Parrett in the Chair) supported the
                                    motion, and spoke at length, setting forth the necessity as well
                                    the economy of the bill - cutting off extra allowances for
                                    assistance.
                                Mr. JENKINSON replied.
                                Mr. PACKARD also opposed the reconsideration. There was no
                                    assurance that these bills for extra attorney's fees would not
                                    come in.
                                Mr. FISHER said there would be no appropriation to pay such
                                    bills.
                                Mr. HOLCOMB demanded the previous question, and there being a
                                    second, under its operation the vote was not reconsidered - yeas
                                    33 nays 39.
                                The House then, at 10 o'clock P. M., adjourned.

                            FRIDAY, May 31, 1861.

                            section of an act in relation to the election of clerks to the circuit

                        Mr. JOHNSTON made an ineffectual motion to lay the report and bill on the
                            table.
                        The report was concurred in.

                            Mr. TARKINGTON made the following report:
                            Mr. President - The Committee on Finance, to whom

                                directed me to report the same back and recommend its passage.
                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            PROPERTY REDEMPTION.
                            Mr. WOLFE submitted the following:
                            Mr. President - The Judiciary Committee, to whom
                                was referred House bill No. 28, have had the same under consideration according to

                                recommendation that it lie on the table.
                            Mr. ANTHONY said this was a proposition to redeem property by paying
                                ten per cent, interest on the purchase money; which was enough.
                            Mr. RAY. This bill proposes not to impair the obligation of a
                                contract; it does not confer privileges on one class not conferred
                                upon another; it does not look towards creating any obstacle to the
                                collection of debts, but on the contrary makes it more secure than
                                before, and, of course, does not impair the security of the debtor.
                                The main feature of the bill is right.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER was opposed both to the substance and and
                                the details of the bill.

                                Mr. President - The select Committee to which was referred House

                                    the Southern State Prison, etc., have had the same under
                                    consideration, and direct me to report the same back and
                                    recommend its passage.
                                After considerable debate -
                                Mr. SLACK demanded the previous question.
                                There being a second -
                                The committee's report was concurred in, by yeas 21, nays 17.
                                Mr. FERGUSON moved to consider the bill as engrossed, and read
                                    the bill the third time now.
                                Mr. BEARSS made an ineffectual motion yeas 16, nays 24 - to lay
                                    the bill on the table.
                                Mr. HAMILTON moved to strike out "$30,000" and insert
                                    $15,000."
                                Mr. SLACK made an ineffectual attempt to lay the amendment on the
                                    table.
                                Mr. MELLETT moved to amend the amendment by striking out "8,500"
                                    where it occurs.
                                This motion was agreed to upon a division yeas 19, nays 15.

                                On motion by Mr. CULVER, this amendment was laid on the table
                                    affirmative 15, negative 13.
                                Mr. SHOEMAKER moved to reconsider the vote by which Mr. Mellett's
                                    amendment to the amendment was adopted.
                                Mr. MELLETT made an ineffectual motion to lay the motion on the
                                    table - yeas 13, nays 25.
                                The motion to reconsider was agreed to, and the amendment
                                    striking out $8,500 was rejected.
                                Mr. TEEGARDEN moved to strike out'"200" the number of prisoners
                                    to be removed, but consented to a modification by Mr. CONNER,
                                    inserting "101" instead of "200."
                                On motion by Mr. WOLFE this amendment was laid on the table.
                                Mr. WOLFE demanded the previous question.
                                The demand was seconded by twenty-six Senators.
                                The yeas and nays being taken on a motion to suspend the rules in
                                    order that the bill may be read the third time now, resulted
                                    yeas 33, nays 6.
                                Two-thirds of all the members of the body not voting in the
                                    affirmative, the motion was rejected.

                                Mr. NEWCOMB introduced a bill [S. No. 56] entitled "a bill
                                    authorizing the Governor to borrow money in certain cases

                                    expended and repaid," which was read the first time.
                                Mr. NEWCOMB moved to suspend the rules that the bill may be read
                                    the second time by title only.
                                On motion by Mr. CONNER, a bill which he desired to introduce was
                                    included in the motion.
                                On motion, the bills H. R. 68 and H. R. 67 were also included in the motion.

                                Mr. BLAIR moved to suspend the rules in order to read the bill
                                    the second time now.

                                    motion.
                                The PRESIDENT decided that demand out of order.

                                On motion by Mr. MARCH the bill was amended by adding to the

                                    report at the next General Assembly.
                                Mr. RAY made an ineffectual motion - yeas 17, nays 25 - to
                                    indefinitely postpone the bill.
                                The bill was read the third time and failed to pass - yeas 23,
                                    nays 18 - for want of a constitutional majority.

                                On motion by Mr. FERGUSON a House message refusing to concur in

                                Mr. FERGUSON made an ineffectual motion - yeas 16, nays 23 -
                                    that, the Senate recede.

                                    viz: Messrs. Ferguson, Anthony and Mellett.

                                    second times, under a dispensation of the rules - yeas 34, nays
                                    6 - and failed to pass - yeas 27, nays 14.

                                    House to concur in Senate amendments to the bill [H. R. 70] was taken up.
                                Mr. HULL made an ineffectual motion - yeas 5, nays 27 - that the
                                    Senate recede.
                                On Mr. LINE'S motion the PRESIDENT appointed Messrs. Line,

                                Mr. ANTHONY, from the committee of free
                                        conference on the Southern Prison bill, H. R. 39] made a report.
                                Mr. BEARSS made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.
                                Mr. BEARSS moved to lay it on the table.
                                The yeas and nays were ordered, and being taken resulted - yeas
                                    15, nays 17. No quorum.
                                Mr. JOHNSTON made an ineffectual motion - yeas 14, nays 22 - to

                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            FRIDAY, May 31, 1861.
                        
                        The House met at 9 o'clock A. M.
                        On motion by Mr. GIFFORD, the reading Of the journal was dispensed
                            with.
                        
                            SICK SOLDIERS' FUND.
                            Mr. WARRUM submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Be it resolved by the House (the Senate
                                                concurring therein,) That the members of this
                                            General Assembly contribute the per diem pay allowed
                                            them during the recess, to a fund for the relief of sick
                                            soldiers of the volunteer regiments from this State. The
                                            fund so raised is to be called the Hospital Fund, and is
                                            to be equally divided between the several regiments of
                                            Indiana troops in the active service of the State and of
                                            the United States, and is to be expended in purchasing
                                            such extra supplies as the Army Surgeons may approve,
                                            for the use of the sick of the several regiments.
                                    
                                
                            
                            On motion of Mr. BUNDY, it was referred to the Committee on
                                    Military Affairs.
                            On motion of Mr. BUNDY, Mr. Orr had leave of absence for the
                                remainder of the session.
                        
                        
                            PERSONAL.
                            Mr. PROSSER said he was erroneously reported as opposing the
                                University bill of the Senate. He was not in the House at the time.
                                The report says: "It seems to me that there is a good deal of French
                                suffrage in the bill." He did not know how to apply that.
                            Mr BRETT. I desire to make another explanation, in reference to a
                                report of what I said here day before yesterday, in reference to the
                                bill for the pay of soldiers. I am reported to have said that I had
                                had a conversation with officers who said they were willing to
                                advance the soldiers pay out of their own pockets. I said I had a
                                conversation with certain officers and men, who told me that they
                                were willing to receive from the State an advance on their pay. The
                                way I am reported it would place me in an absurd position.
                            Mr. PARRETT read an article from the Sentinel of
                                this morning, copied from the Sullivan Democrat.
                                It charges upon this House the action of the Senate, and amounts to
                                what he called a personal reflection. He read the article,
                                commencing with these words: "The first proposition is to raise
                                twelve regiments," etc. If that is not a reflection on us I don't
                                know what would be.
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair would recommend the propriety of adopting a
                                resolution that the editor has lied.
                        
                        
                            ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC APPROPRIATION BILL.
                            On motion by Mr. BUNDY, the House took up the calendar of Senate
                                messages.
                            The Senate amendments to the additional specific appropriation bill,
                                were taken up, and amongst others, the House refused to concur in
                                the amendments affecting the per diem of clerks.
                        
                        
                            BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS.
                            On motion of Mr. KENDRICK, this bill [66] fixing the tenure of office
                                and pay of the Superintendants of the State Benevolent Institutions
                                was taken up.
                            Mr. KENDRICK said the bill would be agreeable to the Board and the
                                several Superintendants.
                            
                            Mr. FRASIER. Who elects the Superintendants?
                            Mr. KENDRICK. The Board, as heretofore.
                            Mr. BUNDY. It could not pass the Senate at this late stage. There are
                                some features in it that he could not approve, and he moved to lay
                                the bill on the table.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            MAJOR HEFFREN.
                            Mr. BINGHAM submitted the following:
                            WHEREAS, It is necessary, in view of the perilous character of the
                                times, to use the greatest precaution in the selection of men to
                                military commands, not only for the honor and safety of our country,
                                but for the lives of our men:
                            AND WHEREAS, Words and acts are the only evidences by which we
                                determine who are patriots and who are hostile to the General
                                Government:
                            AND WHEREAS, The course pursued by Horace Heffren, a member of this
                                House, at the late regular session, and continued at the present
                                session, has been seditious in its tendency, and we can not look
                                upon his appointment to an important military command as judicious
                                or justifiable: Therefore,
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That we hereby express our
                                            disapprobation of the act of Oliver P. Morton, Governor
                                            of the State of Indiana, in appointing said Horace
                                            Heffren Major in the 13th regiment of the Indiana
                                            troops.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. FRASIER. I move to postpone the further consideration of the
                                preamble and resolutions, and make it the special order for
                                to-morrow 10 o'clock.
                            Mr HEFFREN. I hope the gentleman will withdraw that. I can not remain
                                tomorrow, and I want to hear the explanation of the gentleman from
                                Jennings (Mr. Bingham;) and then I want to be heard ten minutes.
                            Mr. FRASIER. I shall not insist.
                            Mr. BINGHAM. The gentleman from Kosciusko has anticipated the motion
                                I designed to make. I did not expect to explain the reasons to day
                                that have induced me to offer this resolution. But inasmuch as the
                                gentleman from Washington and Harrison can not be here to-morrow, I
                                will make the explanation. It is simply this:
                            At the last session of the Legislature it was foreseen that the
                                troublous times which are now upon us would certainly ensue. During
                                all that session the course of that gentleman was certainly in
                                opposition to every effort made by the House to put the State in a
                                condition of military defence. Not only that, but as one of the
                                leaders of his party, he took occasion, after making his speech on
                                this floor, to print a large number of copies of it, which were
                                distributed all over the State to be a guide as to the course his
                                party should pursue. That speech contains various propositions
                                hostile to the principles and policy proposed to be inaugurated in
                                this House. I have been told - whether the information be correct or
                                not - that copies of that very speech were sent to various papers
                                published in the South, and by them copied as the recognized views
                                of one of the leading members of the Democratic party in the State
                                of Indiana.
                            It is true that at that time that was the gentleman's privilege - his
                                right. But this session I am happy to see conviction so clear coming
                                over the mind of the gentleman, that his case is beginning to look
                                like salvation. But his repentance, I apprehend, is not so effective
                                yet as to entitle him to the military command which the Governor has
                                tendered him.
                            When we came here, Mr. Speaker, confusion abounded all through the
                                military operations that were set on foot, not only for the
                                organization of the militia, but it reigned supreme in the
                                organization of companies for the three months service of the United
                                States. In view of that confusion, or consequent upon it, the
                                Governor, when he delivered his message to the two Houses in extra
                                session, was compelled to make the humiliating acknowledgment that
                                he did not know even the number of the companies that were assembled
                                on the camp ground. Even in the printed copies of the message the
                                number is left blank. When I was at home I was inquired of for the
                                number of volunteers here, and I could only refer to the Governor's
                                message, and when they came to look at that paper they found it
                                blank. That kind of inefficiency and utter confusion, I think
                                entirely unjustifiable, and now, when we meet again, since the
                                recess, when the Governor has been urged to bring something like
                                order out of this confusion, he has paid no kind of adequate
                                attention to the matter.
                            Again, when he comes to the appointment of the field officers in the
                                six regiments, he evinces the same want of care which his public
                                duty imposes. And when he is remonstrated with against appointing
                                men without military knowledge and experience to lead our men, and
                                continues to disregard all remonstrances, I think it is right and
                                proper, where an opportunity presents itself, that a resolution of
                                censure upon his course should be passed by this House. But I
                                confess here, so far as I am concerned, that it has not been so much
                                with a view of effecting the position of the gentleman from
                                Washington and Harrison as to censure the Governor, that I have
                                introduced this resolution. And, as I said before, with regard to
                                the gentleman from Washington and Harrison, while he was certainly
                                seditious in his speech of last winter, I am still willing to
                                acknowledge that there is good evidence of reform in his case.
                                Still, I fear it is not so deep that a man would like to swear by
                                it. I submit, therefore, the justice and propriety of such an
                                appointment to the judgment of gentlemen who remember what has been
                                said and done,whether such an appointment can meet the approbation
                                of the members of this House. I recollect last winter that a certain
                                committee was appointed to which was referred a resolution
                                personally affecting the gentleman from Washington and Harrison and
                                the gentleman from Jasper, (Mr. Moody) that the chairmanship of that
                                special committee was committed to me; and I was blamed because I
                                could not succeed in getting that committee together so as to be
                                able to make a report to this House.
                            Mr. BUNDY (interposing.) Did the gentleman ever make an effort to get
                                that committee together?
                            Mr. BlNGHAM. Does the gentleman from Henry doubt? [Laughter.]
                            
                            Mr. FISHER. I insist, Mr. Speaker, that that is a leading
                                question.
                            The SPEAKER. [Mr. McLean in the Chair.] It is entirely out of order
                                to impugn motives.
                            Mr. BINGHAM. The gentleman does not impugn motives, Mr. Speaker; but
                                I am surprised that he should seem to doubt that I did my utmost to
                                get that committee together last winter. But I have submitted this
                                preamble and resolution simply to get a vote of the House as to
                                whether the act of the Governor in this appointment is either
                                judicious or justifiable.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. As the gentleman from Jennings has said (and I have no
                                reason to disbelieve him,) that he is more after the Governor than
                                myself. I shall only occupy a few moments of time. I am sorry that
                                circumstances have arisen which have led the gentleman to believe it
                                his duty to introduce a matter of this kind, at a time like the
                                    the present, when our common country is in danger and
                                her flag despised. I think it were better that the gentleman from
                                Jennings should do as I have done, enlist as a private in a company,
                                agreeing to serve for three years or during the war - to follow that
                                banner which, as the gentleman has said truly, myself and the
                                gentleman who sits by my side helped to place upon the staff over
                                this building, where it still floats. I think, Mr. Speaker, that it
                                is unfortunate. I can not say why now, when the political hatchet
                                has been buried, and, as I trust, never to be dug up while rebellion
                                is in the land. I look upon it as unfortunate, because the gentleman
                                and the Governor were and are, I believe, (if politics be any
                                thing,) political friends, and if they have cause of difficulty I
                                see no reason why I should be dragged in and made a scapegoat
                                between them.
                            A few words in regard to that celebrated speech of mine last winter.
                                At that time, sir, there were two political parties here, each
                                struggling to make their record that when we left this hall we could
                                use it to the best advantage against each other, in order that we
                                might come back in power and occupy the places of our political
                                opponents. I then stood by the Democratic party - that party whose
                                cause I believed to be nothing but the cause of the flag of my
                                country. The gentleman from Jennings and others stood by their
                                political flag, which they believed to be the flag of their country
                                also.
                            Mr. FRASIER (interposing). I would like to ask the gentleman whether
                                soon after the adjournment of the regular session he did not make a
                                speech at Frankfort, Kentucky, and there rather indicate that
                                Indiana would be with the South?
                            Mr. HEFFREN. No, sir; I did not. But as I was saying, that speech was
                                made here under the excitement of the occasion when there were two
                                political parties here. It was also an occasion out of which there
                                arose a personal difficulty of such a nature that had I seen proper
                                to change its terms and expressions at the time, as a man of honor,
                                under the circumstances surrounding me, I could not have done it.
                                And I did not. At that time, sir, our forts had not been captured -
                                our flag had not been insulted - our ships had not been fired into -
                                the flag of our country (with the exception of South Carolina) was
                                still unfurled over every portion of the Union. And I believed at
                                that time that this question never would come upon us. I believed
                                that the Southern people were mad that they were fanatical-, and
                                that they would return to their allegiance. But they have not done
                                it. On the contrary, they have set up a pretended Government for
                                themselves; have organized departments; have raised armies and
                                borrowed money for what? To put down in all these States the
                                authority and the Constitution of the United States. And when it
                                comes to that, the only question an American citizen can ask himself
                                is simply, Shall I maintain my Government or shall I not? And now,
                                Mr. Speaker, I think that when I was willing to go as a private into
                                the service of my country, for the maintenance of the Constitution
                                and laws to the death if necessarythat my best blood might be poured
                                out for their defense on a soil not that of my nativity, how does
                                the gentleman say there is want of evidence of my sincerity? He
                                assumes my penitence, and seems to think so long as the principle is
                                good that -
                            "Whilst the lamp holds out to burn, The vilest sinner may
                                return,"
                            I might yet come in.
                            Now on the part of His Excellency, the Governor, he has tendered me
                                this commission, to which the preamble to the resolution refers,
                                and, if I go under it, I propose to go for three years, or as much
                                longer as necessary - I propose to follow the flag of my country
                                wherever it may go, and I tell you, sir, I am apprehensive that some
                                who have maligned my motives and misrepresented my condition, would
                                never dare to follow as far, and stand by the side of those who
                                stand by me in defence of the country.
                            Now I am sorry my friend from Jennings has introduced this
                                resolution, because he is my personal friend, as well as because the
                                object seems to be to strike at the Governor over the shoulders of
                                others. I am at a loss -
                            Mr. VEATCH, interposing. I desire to ask the gentleman whether, last
                                winter, in this hall, he did not state that if the President should
                                call on the State of Indiana for troops to subdue the South, he
                                would not resign his commission, and leave his home and the scenes
                                of his childhood, and shoulder a musket, and fight for the defence
                                of Southern States?
                            Mr. HEFFREN. If the gentleman would put the whole of the sentence
                                together, it would make another meaning. I stated that I would
                                rather be a private in the army, fighting in defence of my rights
                                under the Constitution, than to be commander-in-chief of the army
                                that should go to deprive any people of those rights. I meant that I
                                would rather be a private with troops of the State of Indiana, and
                                fight for the defence of those rights which the Constitution
                                guarantees, than to be commander-in chief of an army that might come
                                from Michigan or Illinois to crush out those rights.
                            Mr. VEATCH. My question was as to what the gentleman said he would do
                                in case the President of the United States should call upon the
                                State of Indiana for troops, whether the gentleman did not say he
                                would rather be a private in a Southern army than be
                                commander-in-chief in Indiana?
                        
                    
                
                
                

                    BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                    BY ARIEL, & W. H. DRAPIER.
                    
                        Vol. V.
                        INDIANAPOLIS, JUNE 3, 1861.
                        NO. 16.
                    
                    
                        
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I did not say that. But, Mr. Speaker, here is another
                                thing. Why am I singled out from all Democrats on this floor? Why am
                                I to be made the sole Judas Iscariot in this matter, when you
                                yourself, Mr. Speaker, stood with me? You were one on that committee
                                [Mr. McLEAN, of Vigo, was in the Chair at this time,] which made the
                                offensive report - I was another; the gentleman from Allen was
                                another; the gentleman from Dearborn was another; the gentleman from
                                Casswas another.
                            Mr. ATKISSON, interrupting. It was well known to the House at the
                                time that I disapproved of the sentiments of that report.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I submit, Mr. Speaker, whether it is right that this
                                matter should all be laid on me, or whether it is right that I
                                should be made the subject of rebuke? Have I not been at work with
                                you? What man has worked harder than I to pass the present militia
                                law, or for any bill which has been before us for the military
                                preparations and defense of the State.
                            Mr. ROBERTS, interrupting. I believe the gentleman from Washington
                                and Harrison maintained in a speech last winter the position that a
                                State had a right to secede and separate herself from the General
                                Government at will. Now I wish to know whether he still adheres to
                                that position?
                            Mr. HEFFREN. That was a legal question which I discussed. And if you
                                will look into the speech you will find that my authorities - James
                                Madison and others - sustained the position I laid down.
                            Mr. ROBERTS. Do you still adhere ot that position?
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I can not say that I do. My answer is this: These States
                                are now in rebellion. They have attempted and are now doing all in
                                their power to break down the Government of the United States and
                                destroy the Constitution that Government and Constitution which I
                                support and which I will support if it takes the best blood that
                                courses through my heart. [Applause from the benches.]
                            Mr. BRETT. Do you still hold that position?
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I do not. But I was going on to say the House will take
                                its own course as to this resolution. Members will vote upon it as
                                they may see fit. But I trust I have too much manhood to be
                                dragooned into any course that my own judgement and sense of right
                                can not approve. I think it is proper for me to say that whatever
                                shall be the course of the House, I shall still consult my own
                                judgment as well as that of the Governor upon the matter. But now I
                                take leave of the subject. Perhaps it is the last opportunity I
                                shall have to stand before the House; and when I leave I desire to
                                leave in peace, as all honorable men would desire to depart. And in
                                this desire also is embraced the difficulty with the gentleman from
                                Jasper, who, thank God, has also shouldered a musket. I desire to
                                leave here as that gentlemen has done, and not go out because of an
                                attempted stab at the Governor, that shall leave me dishonored and
                                my character and manhood maligned.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. If the object of the resolution of the gentleman
                                from Jennings was to enable the gentleman from Washington and
                                Harrison to make an explanation to the House it was well enough; and
                                if that gentleman had explained to the satisfaction of the House the
                                object was gained. He was satisfied that if gentlemen would take the
                                trouble to look over the proceedings of the last and the present
                                session, they would be convinced that the gentleman from Washington
                                and Harrison has been as active and sincere as any member of the
                                House in the cause of our common country. The gentleman had riot
                                ceased to labor in various committees; and from time to time had
                                expressed himself on this floor with reference to the troublous
                                condition of our country in such a manner as to meet the sanction of
                                Republicans as well as Democrats. It was understood also, at the
                                opening of the session, that party designations should be forgotten
                                - in the language of the gentleman from Washington and Harrison, we
                                concluded to forget our political differences and unite as one man
                                for the support of a common flag and a common country. Satisfied of
                                the patriotism of the gentleman from Washington and Harrison, he
                                regarded it as unfair and unjust to stab at the Governor through
                                him, as the gentleman from Jennings seemed to admit was the
                                intention. He would now test the sincerity of the gentleman from
                                Jennings. If the Governor made unwise appointments, let the House
                                say so; and let it say, also, who are the proper sources of these
                                military appointments. He contended that these appointments should
                                be made by the men of the regiment. He moved to strike out all after
                                the first paragraph in the preamble and insert in lieu thereof the
                                following:
                            "AND WHEREAS, Experience and the history of former wars have shown
                                that it is better that all regimental officers should be selected
                                     by the men of the
                                companies in it, rather than by appointment of the Governor, or any
                                other source of appointment; therefore,
                            
                                
                                    
                                        "Resolved by the House, (the Senate
                                            concurring,) That the militia law of the State ought to
                                            be so changed that all regimental officers shall be
                                            elected by the men of the regiment."
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I hope the gentleman will allow the vote to come fair
                                and square.
                            The SPEAKER. (Mr. McLean.) The Chair will decide the amendment out of
                                order, because not germain to the matter of the original
                                proposition.
                            Mr. NEBEKER rehearsed his recollections of Mr. Heffren's printed
                                speech last winter.
                            Mr. SHERMAN. I regret the introduction of the resolution. No possible
                                good can come of it. I am not disposed to vindicate the gentleman
                                from Washington and Harrison. He is able to vindicate himself. No
                                man deprecated more than I did the policy pursued by him at the
                                regular session. But his course since that has indicated a change of
                                opinion. Sir, "it is human to err, but God-like to forgive." It is
                                the privilege of a freeman to change his opinions. It shows that he
                                is wiser to-day than he was yesterday; and I trust from the course
                                now pursued by the gentleman from Washington and Harrison, that his
                                opinions have now changed. And if he has been guilty of foibles, the
                                mouth of a Christian charity should cover up the foibles of a
                                brother and friend. I also regret the attempt to censure the
                                Governor. I think, sir, we are too ready to censure the officers of
                                State. What man could have administered in this sudden crisis with
                                more promptitude and fidelity than our Governor? I believe his every
                                act has been performed in good faith, and I am unwilling that this
                                resolution of censure of his conduct should be entertained in this
                                House. I move that it be laid on the table.
                            Mr. ATKISSON demanded the yeas and nays, and they were reported -
                                yeas 70, nays 9, 2 present and not voting.
                            So the preamble and resolution was laid on the table.
                        
                        
                            PUBLIC ARMS.
                            Mr. FRASIER submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Governor be
                                            requested to inform the House what steps have been taken
                                            by him for the purchase of arms for the State.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. GRESHAM desired to add a clause calling on the Governor " for
                                copies of his instructions to agents sent to purchase arms, as well
                                as their replies thereto."
                            Mr. EDSON. Would it be consistent with the public interest to publish
                                that information?
                            Mr. TURNER proposed to insert a clause: "If, in his opinion, it
                                should not be inconsistant with the public interest."
                            The amendment was adopted.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG proposed to amend further: "And what has been done as
                                to the distribution of first class arms to the border counties."
                            Mr. DAVIS. Any gentleman may find that out by going below and seeing
                                the Governor. I move to lay the amendment on the table.
                            The motion was rejected.
                            Mr. Gresham's amendment was adopted.
                            After debate by Mr. Gresham, Mr. Ferguson and Mr. Ragan -
                            On the motion of Mr. BUNDY, the further consideration of the subject
                                was postponed, and it was made the special order for to-morrow.
                        
                        
                            ADDITIONAL SPECIAL APPROPRIATION BILL.
                            On motion by Mr. FISHER, the Senate's request for a committee of
                                conference on the disagreements as to the items in the additional
                                specific appropriation bill, was taken up; and it was
                            Ordered, That a committee be appointed on the part
                                of the House of Representatives.
                            Whereupon the SPEAKER appointed Messrs, Bundy, Stotsenberg and
                                Gresham.
                        
                        
                            COMMON SCHOOL TAX.
                            On motion by Mr. ATKISSON, his school tax bill [64] [It taxes where
                                the property lies,] was taken up, considered on the final reading,
                                and passed the House of Represeneatives - yeas 67, nays 5with an
                                amendment of title: An act to amend section 46 [of the school law of
                                March 11.]
                        
                        
                            OFFICIAL STATEMENT OF FEES AND PERQUISITES.
                            On motion of Mr BUNDY, the official fees and perquisites statement
                                bill, [S. 43] was considered
                                on the third reading.
                            Mr. FRASIER regarded it a good deal like quirk to a pig's tail - a
                                good deal more for ornament than use. He moved to lay it on the
                                table.
                            The motion failed.
                            Mr. BUNDY was surprised at this effort. What so much needed as
                                information as to the fees and perquisites of our public officers,
                                when the Legislature comes to fix their compensation?
                            Mr. DAVIS. It would devolve a great deal of unnecessary labor on
                                those county officers. The law provides for the compensation of
                                public officers, and there was no use in this inquiry.
                            Mr. ATKISSON. It would devolve a great deal of trouble and expense,
                                and give us no adequate return.
                            Mr. FISHER. What we wanted to find out was whether our clerks,
                                sheriffs, auditors and treasurers are receiving a compensation
                                greater than they ought to receive.
                            Mr. FRASIER. Had the gentleman estimated the expense of books to
                                enable these officers to make their returns.
                            Mr. FISHER. The act did not contemplate any expense in that way.
                            Mr. TURNER thought the bill would amount to nothing if passed. It
                                would not compel these returns. He therefore moved to lay the bill
                                on the table.
                            The bill failed on the final reading - yeas 43, nays 25 - for want of
                                a constitutional majority.
                        
                        
                            OFFICIAL GARNISHMENT BILL.
                            Mr. EDSON, from the Committee on the Ju- diciary, returned the
                                official garnishment bill (S. 26,) without amendments, and with the expression of
                                opinion that the same ought to pass.
                            Mr. EDSON explained how it applied to a defect in the existing laws,
                                and hoped to see it passed unanimously.
                            The bill tailed on the final reading - yeas 45, nays 1 - no quorum
                                voting.
                            The House then took a recess till two o'clock P.M.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            On motion the Senate's resolution asking the governor to return the
                                additional general appropriation bill, was laid on the table.
                            Mr. STEVENSON submitted the following joint resolution:
                            WHEREAS, In view of the unfortunate and distracted state of affairs
                                in our Government, and the fact that several of the States of this
                                Union are now in armed rebellion against the Constitu tion and the
                                laws of the General Government, and that we acknowledge our
                                obligation to sustain the Government in maintaining the Constitution
                                and the supremacy of the laws and the enforcement of obedience
                                thereto:
                            AND WHEREAS, Designing men have extensively propogated the belief in
                                the minds of the Southern people, that the present war attitude of
                                the North is for the purpose of exterminating slavery in the
                                Southern States, which has alarmed and excited them to desperation,
                                and for the purpose of vindicating ourselves and disabusing the
                                minds of the Southern people who are loyal to the Government;
                                therefore -
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Be it resolved, &c., That we
                                            denounce any attempt from any source whatever, to
                                            interfere with the domestic institutions of any other
                                            State, and while we claim the right to regulate our own
                                            domestic institutions in our own way, subject only to
                                            the Constitution of the United States, we freely extend
                                            the same rights to every other State.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. SHERMAN. Whenever he saw a female proclaiming her virtue in the
                                streets, he thought she would do to be watched. Whenever he heard a
                                man proclaiming abroad the fact that he is not a thief, if he were
                                an honest man he could not but think he was doing a very gratuitous
                                thing. So he thought of all resolutions of this kind introduced upon
                                this floor.
                            He demanded the previous question, but withdrew it -
                            Mr. FRASIER objecting to the suppression of debate.
                            Mr. JENKINSON proposed that the resolution should read "several
                                persons in rebellion," instead of "several States," &c.
                            On motion by Mr. JONES of Tippecanoe, it Us made the special order
                                for to-morrow morning, 10 o'clock.

                            
                                DECATUR SENATORIAL VACANCY.
                                Mr. HAYES submitted the following:
                                WHEREAS, The Constitution of the State of Indiana, article fifth,
                                    section nineteen declares that "he," (the Governor,) "shall
                                    issue writs of Section to fill such vacancies as may have
                                    occurred in the General Assembly," and -
                                WHEREAS, It appears from the reported proceedings of the Senate
                                    that a vacancy does exist in the General Assembly of said State
                                    on account of the death of the Hon. Richard Robbins, Senator
                                    from the county of Decatur, which vacancy has existed for a
                                    considerable length of time, Therefore -
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Governor be
                                                requested to inform this House if he has issued a
                                                writ of election to fill such vacancy; and, if such
                                                writ of election has not been issued that he be
                                                requested to inform this House why, or for what
                                                reason he he has failed, refused,
                                                neglected or omitted to issue such writ of election
                                                as required by the above recited provision of the
                                                Constitution.
                                            On motion by Mr. ROBBINS, it was laid on the
                                                table.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                AUDITING COMMISSIONERS.
                                Mr. RAGAN moved to take up from the table the Senate joint
                                    resolution asking the Governor to return the additional general
                                    appropriation bill, No. 60.
                                Mr. FISHER. It was understood that the Governor had signed the
                                    bill. He went on to state that perhaps the State Auditor would
                                    like to get rid of the bill. But the Governor had approved it,
                                    although he might desire to have it otherwise, and others with
                                    him, he (Mr. F.) did not want to see the subject opened here
                                    again. He had more confidence in a disbursing committee of the
                                    General Assembly, than in any set of clerks which the Auditor
                                    could appoint.
                                Mr. Ragan's motion was rejected.
                                Mr. HOLCOMB presented sundry memorials on the subject of a relief
                                    law, which were laid on the table, without reading.
                                The SPEAKER, pro tem, appointed Messrs.
                                    Heffren, Edson, and Nebeker, to serve on the part of the House
                                    as the committee of conference on the disagreeing votes as to
                                    amendments to the additional specific appropriation
                                    bill.OFFICIAL STATEMENT OF FEES AND PERQUISITES.The vote was now
                                    again taken on the official fee and perquisite statement bill,
                                    [S. 43] which failed this
                                    morning for want of a constitutional majority, resulting - yeas
                                    44, nays 29: so the bill failed again.
                                On the motion of Mr. FRASIER the bill was now indefinitely
                                    postponed.
                            
                            
                                OFFICIAL GARNISHMENT BILL.
                                The official garnishment bill [S. 26] which failed this
                                    morning for want of a quorum on the final vote, was now again
                                    put on its passage, the vote resulting - yeas 70, nays 4. So the
                                    bill passed the House of Representatives.
                            
                            
                                MONEY FOR THE INDIANA VOLUNTEERS.
                                The Senate concurrent resolution, authorizing the Treasurer to
                                    loan money to the officers of the Indiana volunteers in the
                                    service of the United States, any sum not exceeding the monthly
                                    pay roll of such officers, was taken up.
                                Mr. FISHER proposed to include the State troops.
                                The amendment was adopted.
                                Mr. BRANHAM. Mr. Speaker, I do not know that I understand the
                                    purport of the resolution; but if I do, I am opposed to it. I do
                                    not see the propriety of paying the troops of the United States.
                                    I think it is uncalled for. So far as our own troops are
                                    concerned,  I am willing to
                                    advance a month's pay. But, sir, there is another thing. You
                                    have not got money enough in the treasury to make this advance;
                                    and to make a show of helping the Government of the United
                                    States when we have not got money enough for our own purposes,
                                    is not only unnecessary but ridiculous. Then again: I am not
                                    willing to trust any militiary officer in such a case. Why
                                    should we treat the men at the head of these regiments any
                                    different from other men? I know something about this paying
                                    men. We have had to pay 500 men a month for five years: and we
                                    pay the men themselves. I say if the State, pay, pay the men. I
                                    shall be unwilling to place money in the hands of any officer,
                                    to do as he pleases with it. Mr. Speaker, what would be the
                                    effect of the passage of this resolution ? It is to say to the
                                    world that the United States government is not able to pay her
                                    men. It is to injure the credit of the United States. It is also
                                    to injure the credit of our own State, by the exhibition of an
                                    unwise prodigality of means. If we are not cautious, we shall
                                    not be able to sell our bonds.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG demanded the yeas and nays.
                                Mr. FRASIER moved to strike out all that relates to the troops in
                                    the service of the United States; and that the money be paid
                                    through the Paymaster.
                                Mr. Speaker ALLEN, (Mr. Sherman in the chair,) could see no
                                    propriety in the resolution, in view of the Paymaster's bill
                                    which passed the House yesterday, and there were various
                                    objections to it. On his motion the resolution was laid on the
                                    table.

                                Mr. McLean's bill [36] for stamping worthless bank bills, being
                                    now put upon its passage, the vote was reported - yeas 15, nays
                                    42 - no quorum voting.
                                After proceedings in a call of the House, in which a quorum at
                                    length responded -
                                On motion by Mr. RAGAN, the bill was indefinitely postponed.

                                Mr HEFFREN, from the Committee of Conference
                                    on the disagreeing votes as to the bill [S. 31] fixing salaries for
                                    the District Attorneys, reported a compromise on $200
                                    salary.
                                After debate, the report was concurred in.
                            
                            
                                GOVERNOR'S CONTINGENT FUND.
                                Mr. FISHER asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill (71)
                                    making an additional appropriation for the Governor's contingent
                                    fund: [$25,000 out of the one million fund]; and (the rules
                                    being suspended for the purpose,) it was twice read and
                                    considered on the second reading.
                                Mr. BRANHAM. Mr. Speaker, there seems to be some misunderstanding
                                    in the House with reference to this matter. At the regular
                                    session, in anticipation of some trouble, there was made an
                                    appropriation of $5,000 to the Governor's contingent fund. At
                                    the com. mencement of this session there was an appropriation to
                                    the Governor's contingent fund which was not properly contingent
                                    fund. But whether it was or not, it has all been paid out and
                                    the vouchers filed. Under the extraordinary circumstances with
                                    which we are surrounded, no man can foresee the calls that may
                                    be made upon the treasury. The law in relation to taking money
                                    from the treasury is more stringent than ever it was before, and
                                    I am glad of it. [A voice: "so am I."] But circumstances may
                                    arise in which the Governor will be required to use money. It
                                    might happen for the transportation of troops. The railroad
                                    companies have generally transported troops without demanding
                                    money. But circumstances might arise in which it would be
                                    absolutely necessary to have an amount of money to move them.
                                    Therefore, a contingent fund, in these times, is absolutely
                                    necessary for the public service. I am not willing to give
                                    officers of the State any more discretion than the public good
                                    requires. I move, therefore, that, the bill be considered as
                                    engrossed and read the third time now.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                                Mr. McLEAN. If the bill were amended so as to require the
                                    Governor to file the proper vouchers, I suppose that there would
                                    be no objection to it, and I ask unanimous consent that such a
                                    provision may be incorporated into the bill.
                                The amendment was adopted by consent.
                                Mr. PACKARD spoke generally against the bill, objecting,
                                    specially, that this appropriation should have been forgotten by
                                    the Committee on Ways and Means till the last
                                    hours of the session.
                                Mr. SMITH, of Bartholomew, stated that the Governor had given
                                    notice, days ago, to the committee, that an additional
                                    contingent fund would be asked for.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON. I thought this demand for money ought to come
                                    directly from the Governor himself. Where was the report
                                    accounting for the $5,000 contingent fund appropriated for the
                                    Governor at the regular session? Where were the vouchers for the
                                    expenditure of the one million which was voted into the fund at
                                    the beginning of this session?
                                Mr. JENKINSON was satisfied with the explanation of the gentleman
                                    from Jefferson, [Mr. Branham] and the amendment of the gentleman
                                    from Vigo.
                                Mr. FISHER replied to the objections of Messrs. Packard and
                                    Knowlton. He desired to put the Governor in a position in which,
                                    if he wanted money, he
                                    could use it without being obliged again to run his own credit
                                    to get it.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG demanded the previous question, and under its
                                    operation, the final vote on the bill, as amended, was reported
                                    - yeas 59 naps 12.
                                So the bill passed.
                                The bill [S. 51] was passed the first reading.
                            
                            
                                STATISTICS OF FEES AND PERQUISITE.
                                On motion by Mr. STOTSENBERG, the vote by which the fees and
                                    perquisites statement bill [S. 43] was indefinitely postponed, was reconsidered.
                                Mr. VEATCH explained again the object of the bill - to receive
                                    statistical information with reference to salaries, fees and
                                    perquisites of county officers. He had understood that the
                                    objection was to the penalties; and he moved that there be but
                                    one penalty in the bill, and that fixed at from $10 to $25. [
                                    Consent.]
                                On motion by Mr. HEFFREN, the bill was referred to a select
                                    committee, with instruction to report the foregoing amendment in
                                    form, and the Speaker (Mr. Sherman) appointed Messrs. Heffren,

                                Mr. FISHER reported back sundry papers relative to the Northern
                                    State Prison, which were laid on the table without reading.

                                    returned the bill, amended according to order.
                                The amendment was adopted.
                                The bill was again put on its passage, and the vote was reported
                                    - yeas 55, nays 27 - so the bill passed the House of

                                    the disagreements as to the additional specific appropriation
                                    bill No. 69, reported there-suit of their conference, which was
                                    read.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG presented a minority report, against throwing out
                                    the compensation of Judge Bicknell for holding Monroe Court.
                                Mr. GRESHAM, another member of the committee, opposed the
                                    report.
                                Mr. SMITH, of Bartholomew. Mr. Speaker - At every session of the

                                    allowing the Doorkeeper and Assistants, and the Assistant Clerks
                                    more than three dollars per day. The principal Doorkeeper at
                                    this extra session is from toy own county. I protest now, as
                                    heretofore, against allowing the Doorkeeper and Assistant Clerks
                                    more than three dollars per day. At the beginning of this
                                    session we adopted a resolution declaring that we should only
                                    have one Doorkeeper and two Assistants and two Pages. So for as
                                    the Doorkeeper is concerned that resolution has been carried out
                                    in good faith.
                                Mr. HEFFREN demanded the previous question, to restrain
                                    debate.
                                Mr. JONES, of Tippecanoe, demanded the yeas and nays, which
                                    resulted - yeas 27, nays 55.
                                So the House refused to concur in the report of the majority.
                                Ordered that the Clerk acquaint the Senate therewith.
                                The House then at 5:45, took a recess till 7 1/2 o'clock.
                            
                        
                        
                            NIGHT SESSION.
                            After proceedings in a call of the House, from which it appeared that
                                there was present a quorum to do business -
                            Mr. ROBERTS moved to reconsider the vote by which the House refused
                                to concur in the report of the committee of conference on the
                                disagreements as to the amendments to the additional specific
                                appropriation bill, No. 69.
                            Mr. ATKISSON moved to lay that motion on the table.
                            A message from the Senate now announced, by Mr. Brown, Secretary,
                                that that body ask for another committee of
                                conference.
                            The foregoing motions being withdrawn -
                            On motion by Mr. EDSON, the message from the Senate, just reported,
                                was taken up.
                            On motion of Mr. LANE, it was ordered that a new committee of
                                conference be appointed on the part of the House.
                            Whereupon the SPEAKER appointed Messrs. Roberts, Bingham and McLean;
                                and it was
                            Ordered, That the Clerk acquaint the Senate
                                therewith.

                            
                                LEVEES AND DRAINS.
                                The Senate's amendment to the levees and drains bill [32] being read by the
                                    Clerk -
                                Mr. HENRICKS moved that the House concur.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON demanded the yeas and nays, and, the same being
                                    ordered and taken, resulted - yeas 61, nays 10.
                                So the Senate's amendments were concurred in.
                                Mr. WOODHULL asked and obtained leave of absence for Mr.
                                    Hudson.
                            
                            
                                PAY OF STATE TROOPS.
                                Mr. FRASIER submitted the following joint resolution:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved by the General Assembly,
                                                  &c., That the Paymaster General is hereby
                                                instructed that, in computing the time for which the
                                                State troops are to be paid, he compute the same
                                                from the time of the filing of their muster rolls in
                                                the office of the Adjutant General.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. F. was in favor of paying these men from the time they left
                                    their homes.
                                Mr. PARRETT. Are not several of these dates and rolls
                                    fictitious?
                                Mr. FRASIER. Not that I know of. The troops were as much in the
                                    service from the time they left their homes as they could
                                    possibly be. He was speaking for men now under arms in the
                                    service of the State, not of those not mustered into the
                                    service.
                                
                                Mr. PARRETT could see how injustice could be done by hasty action
                                    on this; and therefore he would move that it be referred to the
                                        committee on Military Affairs.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON proposed: "From the election of officers and the
                                    organization of companies;" which was referred with the
                                    bill.
                            
                            
                                QUARTERMASTER DEPARTMENT.
                                Mr. CASON, from the select committee on the
                                        Commissary and Quartermaster's department,
                                    submitted a written report, which was read by the Clerk.
                                It finds over $31,000 expended in this department.
                                Mr. CASON stated, in behalf of the committee, that they made this
                                    report with very great pleasure, finding no evidence of fraud in
                                    the premises, and finding very much to commend in the fidelity,
                                    promptitude and energy, both in the Quartermaster General and
                                    Inspector General.
                                Mr. CASON, from the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary, reported on that part of the Governor's
                                    message which relates to the creation of the office of Paymaster
                                    General. That matter having been acted on by bill, he reported a
                                    motion that the subject be laid on the table.
                                The report was concurred in.
                                Mr. WOODHULL, from the Judiciary Committee,
                                    returned Mr. Collins of Whitley's new Circuit Court bill [40]
                                    expressing regrets that it was now too late tor satisfactory
                                    action thereon, and his own personal satisfaction that its
                                    friends had done what they could to advance the interests of
                                    their constituents in the premises. He then moved to lay the
                                    bill on the table.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG, (for Mr. Bingham,) returned, from the
                                        Committee on Military Affairs, Mr.
                                    Thomas' Liquor bill [50] with a recommendation that the same be
                                    referred to the Committee on Temperance.
                                Mr. BRETT, from the Committee on Military
                                        Affairs, returned Mr. Warrum's Militia Tax bill
                                    [47] recommending that it be laid on the table.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG, (for Mr. Bingham,) returned Mr. Henrick's Bounty
                                    Land resolution, with a motion that it be laid on the table,
                                    expressing the opinion of the committee that its passage at this
                                    time would be inexpedient.
                            
                            
                                GOVERNOR'S LOAN BILL.
                                The bill [S. 56]
                                    authorizing the Governor to borrow money in certain cases, (when
                                    it shall be necessary to purchase army supplies,) was read
                                    twice, under a dispensation, and considered on the second
                                    reading.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON proposed to insert, appropriately, after the word
                                    "Governor," the words "Auditor and Treasurer of State," which
                                    was adopted by consent.
                                Mr. PACKARD considered the bill was designed to avoid the
                                    embezzlement bill. It should be better guarded.
                                Mr. BUNDY replied to his objections.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG demanded the previous question; and
                                    thereupon,
                                The bill was passed the final reading - yeas 72, nays 3 - with
                                    "Auditor and Treasurer" in the title.
                            
                            
                                WET LAND BILL.
                                The Wet Land Drain bill (S. 57] was read twice, under a dispensation, and
                                    considered on the second reading.
                                Messrs. VEATCH, JENKINSON, and FRASIER, severally considered that
                                    the bill contained valuable provisions and ought to pass. It
                                    authorizes the land-owner to enter and ditch on the lands of his
                                    neighbor, if necessary to drain his land, by natural out-let,
                                    being responsible for damages, as against the benefit conferred
                                    by his work.
                                The bill was passed the final reading in the House of
                                    Representatives - yeas 70, nays 1.
                            
                            
                                NORTHERN PRISON.
                                The Senate amendments to the Northern Prison bill, [H. R. 39,] reducing the
                                    appropriation from $30,090 to $15,000, coming up -
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG moved that the House refuse to concur, and spoke
                                    generally for the continuance and completion of the work on the
                                    Northern Prison.
                                Mr. FISHER insisted that those prisoners could not be maintained
                                    at the Northern prison for one cent less than $30,000.
                                Mr. HOWARD was satisfied that the sum of $15,000 was quite too
                                    low, but it was the best we could now get from the Senate. We
                                    had better concur, than not to have anything.
                                Mr. VEATCH took various considerations in favor of insisting on
                                    the $30,000, &c.
                                Mr. SMITH of Bartholomew demanded the previous question, and
                                    under its pressure the House refused to concur in the amendments
                                    of the Senate.
                                ORDERED, That the Clerk acquaint the Senate therewith.
                            
                            
                                SWAMP LAND INVESTIGATION.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON submitted the following joint resolution rescinding
                                    the appointment of the committee on swamp land
                                        frauds:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved by the General Assembly of the

                                The Senate's amendment to Mr. Stotsenberg's Redemption bill [28] was concurred in.

                                Mr. JENKINSON made an ineffectual motion to take up from the

                                The Senate asking a committee of conference on the disagreements
                                    as to the Northern Prison bill, under the order of the House,
                                    the Speaker appointed Messrs. Stotsenberg, Fisher, and Smith of
                                    Bartholomew to serve as said committee on the part of the House
                                    of Representatives.

                                    adopted:

                                                House are due, and are hereby tendered to the Hon.
                                                Cyrus M. Allen, for the very able, dignified and
                                                impartial manner in which he has dis charged the

                                ARMY PAYMASTER.
                                The Senate's amendment to the Paymaster bill [H. R. 70] making his salary $500
                                    instead of $1,000, just announced by message, by Mr. Secretary
                                    Brown, was taken up.
                                Mr. BINGHAM moved that the House refuse to concur.
                                After debate -
                                The motion was agreed to, and it was ordered that the Clerk
                                    acquaint the Senate therewith.
                            
                            
                                NORTHERN PRISON.
                                Mr. STOTSENBERG, from the conference committee on the
                                    disagreements as to the amendments to Mr. Veatch's Northern
                                    Prison bill [39] reported that the Senate recedes from its
                                    reduction of the $30,000, &c.
                                The report was concurred in.
                            
                            
                                ARMY PAYMASTER.
                                The Senate, by message, by Mr. Secretary Brown, desiring a
                                    committee of conference on the disagreeing votes as to the
                                    amendment to the Paymaster bill [H. R. 70] it was accorded by the
                                    House, and the Speaker appointed Messrs. Jenkinson, Haworth, and
                                    Bingham as the committee.
                                Mr. JENKINSON, from the committee of
                                        conference, reported a compromise on the
                                    Paymaster's salary, fixing it at $750.
                                The House concurred in the amendment.
                                It having been announced by message that the Senate refuses to
                                    concur in the conference committee's report
                                    on the disagreements as to the amendments to Mr. Veatch's Prison
                                    bill [39[ -
                                On motion by Mr. SHERMAN, (on a reconsideration ) the House
                                    concurred in the Senate's amendments to said bill.
                                And then (at 12 o'clock, midnight,) the House adjourned till
                                    to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            SATURDAY, June 1, 1861.
                        
                        Mr. CONNER moved that the Senate recede from its adherence to its
                            amendments to the paymaster bill H. R. 
                                70.
                        Mr. C. stated that unless the bill was passed, which could only be done
                            by the Senate action indicated in his motion, there would have to be
                            appointed, under the regular military regulations, a paymaster for each
                            regiment, which would, of course, involve a much heavier expense than
                            that contemplated in the bill. He thought this action would make the
                            bill a law, as the bill was passed on yesterday.
                        The PRESIDENT substantiated these remarks and suggested the propriety of
                            agreeing to the motion without objection.
                        The motion to recede was taken as agreed to by consent.
                        
                            EXPENDITURE OF THE $100,000 MILITARY FUND.
                            The following communication was received from the Governor, at the
                                hands of Wm. R. Holloway, Esq., Executive messenger:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        STATE OF INDIANA, EXECUTIVE
                                            DEPARTMENT, Indiadapolis, June 1, 1861.
                                        To the Senate of the State of
                                            Indiana:
                                        At 8 o'clock last evening, a resolution, passed by your
                                            Honorable Body, calling upon me to give a detailed
                                            statement of the expenditures of the one hundred
                                            thousand dollars appropriated as a military contingent
                                            fund to the Governor, was laid before me.
                                        In the brief period allowed for the answer, it will be
                                            impossible to give all the items, which would involve an
                                            examination of over two thousand vouchers. These
                                            vouchers are on file in the office of the State
                                            Auditor.
                                        From the records in my office, a general statement can be
                                            given. On the 4th day of May last I drew from the
                                            Treasury $10,000. Of this amount, $6,000 was immediately
                                            paid to J. H. Vajen, Quartermaster General, on account
                                            of debts already accrued. $616 63 was paid for
                                            telegraphing; the balance, $3,383 27, was deposited to
                                            the credit of the State as a reserved contingent fund,
                                            and is still unexpended. Since that time I have examined
                                            and passed vouchers to the amount of $133,177 78. Of
                                            this amount, $2,500 was paid by a loan made from the
                                            Bank before the meeting of the Legislature. The above
                                            sums were all expended for the subsistence, clothing,
                                            equipment and transportation of the troops raised in
                                            this State for State and Federal purposes, and
                                            incidental expenses connected therewith. It will be seen
                                            that the fund is exhausted. This results from the fact
                                            that the troops were on hand and had to be provided for,
                                            and that the second ap-  propriation was not made
                                            until the 30th of May, two days ago.
                                        
                                            All of which is respectfully submitted.
                                            O. P. MORTON,
                                            Governor.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. MARCH, from the Judiciary Committee, submitted
                                the following report:
                            MR, PRESIDENT - The Committee on the Judiciary, to
                                whom was referred Senate resolution No. 2, directing the committee
                                to inquire whether there is any law now in force providing for the
                                trial of causes where there are affidavits of prejudice against the
                                judge, or the judge is counsel for, or related to either of the
                                parties, have had the same under consideration, and directed me to
                                report the same back, and recommend that it lie on the table, as, in
                                the opinion of the committee, there is ample provision for the trial
                                of such causes,if the judges discharge their duties.

                                    recommended the adoption of a resolution declaring that the Hon.
                                    Jesse D. Bright is no longer an inhabitant of the State of
                                    Indiana; no longer takes any interest in the public affairs; his
                                    position on the questions now engrossing public attention is
                                    wholly unknown to the people, therefore, he has forfeited all
                                    the claim that he may have heretofore had to represent this
                                    State in the Senate of the United States, and that honorable
                                    body is most respectfully and most earnestly requested to per
                                    mit him no longer to occupy a seat therein as the Representative
                                    of the State of Indiana, but to declare the same vacant. - The
                                    report was concurred in.
                                Mr. RAY submitted the following:
                                Mr. President - The Committee on the Judiciary
                                    to whom was referred Senate bill No. 45, have had the same under
                                    consideration and have instructed me to report the same back to
                                    the Senate, and recommend that it be laid on the table.
                                The report was concurred in.
                                Mr. MARCH submitted the following report:
                                Mr. President - The Committee on the
                                    Judiciary, to whom was referred Senate resolution No.
                                    22, a resolution instructing the Judiciary
                                        Committee to inquire whether there is any law
                                    authorizing the granting of new trials in criminal cases before
                                    justices of the peace, have had the same under consideration,
                                    and have directed me to report the same back and recommend that
                                    it lie on the table for want of time. It may be added that the
                                    majority of the committee are of opinion that justices have
                                    power to grant new trials under existing laws.
                                The committee have also directed me to report back a resolution
                                    referred to them in regard to amending the law in relation to
                                    decendent estates, and recommend that it lie on the table, as
                                    there has not been time at the present session to make the
                                    amendment suggested.
                                The PRESIDENT appointed Mr. March upon the committee created
                                    during the regular session to audit the accounts of the officers
                                    of State during the recess of the Legislature, in place of
                                    Senator Wagner, ineligible.
                                Senator Mellett was appointed a committee on the part of the
                                    Senate, to act with a like committee on the part of, the House,
                                    authorized to audit accounts in accordance with the
                                    appropriation bill.
                                Mr. TURNER submitted the following report:
                                Mr. President - The committee appointed to wait on the Governor
                                    and inform him that the General Assembly were now ready to

                                On motion by Mr. MARCH, the Senate adjourned till to-morrow

                            SATURDAY, June 1, 1861.

                            BREVIER REPORTS.
                            Mr. BUNDY submitted the following, which was adopted:

                                            two (2) copies of the acis of the present session, all
                                            to aound in full sheep.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            DAMAGES ON THE STATE FAIR GROUND.
                            Mr. FISHER submitted the following:
                            A concurrent resolution authorizing the Governor to settle with the
                                State Board of Agriculture for the use of, and damage to, the State
                                Fair Grounds, now occupied as a military encampment.
                            WHEREAS, The State Board of Agriculture lave purchased and fitted up,
                                at a heavy expense, grounds upon which to hold annual paris that
                                said Board are largely indebted for said grounds and improvements,
                                which, from the impossibility of holding a successful fair during
                                the present season, will be unable to meet in consequence of which
                                the  grounds will be liable to
                                be sold to satisfy a mortgage upon it.
                            AND WHEREAS, The State has taken possession of said ground and
                                improvements thereon, for the accommodation of troops, appropriting
                                certain property therein and doing much damage to the grounds and
                                fixtures; therefore,
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Be it resolved by the House of
                                                Representatives, (the Senate concurring
                                            therein,) That the Governor be authorized to settle with
                                            said State Board of Agriculture for the use and
                                            occupation of said ground, and such damages as may have
                                            been done thereto, and such personal property as may
                                            have been taken for the use of the troops, and direct
                                            the Auditor to draw a warrant upon the Treasurer for the
                                            amount due said Board.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. FISHER The State had been greatly accommodated by the use of
                                these fair grounds for the Camp here, and damage, of course, had
                                been done by the troops, in the destruction of trees, fence, and
                                lumber, and in the use of about eighty cords of wood which belonged
                                to the State Board of Agriculture. The Board, therefore, shou d have
                                something for damages, and something else by way of rent. The State
                                Board had labored without fee or reward, except the consciousness of
                                service to a great public interest; and this was to authorize the
                                Governor to allow them net damages as it shall appear to him they
                                may be entitled when the troops shall have been removed.
                            Mr. WOODHULL. There was a most magnificent justice in this
                                resolution. Undoubtedly the State had been accommodated very much in
                                the use of these grounds. The stalls on the north side had furnished
                                excellent quarters for the troops.
                            Mr. FISHER (interposing.) I undertake to say that the cost for
                                quarters and barracks which the State Board have furnished could not
                                have been less than $10,000, if the State had procured them in the
                                ordinary way.
                            Mr. PARRETT. It can't pass the House. It can't pass without the yeas
                                and nays.
                            Mr. WOODHULL. All it proposes is that the State shall pay actual
                                damages, and some little compensation for the rent of the lot. If
                                the grounds were unincumbered he supposed they would not ask one
                                farthing. But, unfortunately, the Society was badly embarrassed.
                            Mr. CASON. We were indebted to the State Agricultural Society for the
                                use of their grounds for our soldiers; and on this ground there is a
                                heavy incumbrance which must be paid next year - he knew not exactly
                                the amount. These grounds belonged to the farmers of the State of
                                Indiana, and shall we quarter our troops upon their grounds and
                                expect the farmers and mechanics of the State to bear such an
                                unequal burden? This Legislature had done nothing for the State
                                Agricultural Society, although it knew very well the embarrassment
                                under which it was laboring. Having now quartered our soldiers upon
                                them so as to deprive them of the power to hold the annual fair next
                                fall, should we refuse to pay them damages and rent? What claim of
                                right have we to call on the Agricultural Society to furnish
                                soldiers' quarters, any more than we have to call upon any religions
                                society? You might as well expect the Methodist church for a camp.
                                This resolution does nothing more than require the State to pay the
                                damages, lou might as well require a man to give up his farm for a
                                camp, or distribute soldiers all over the town of Indianapolis. The
                                Agricultural Society is an incorporated body, and I have no doubt,
                                that they could find a legal remedy if you refuse to pass this
                                resolution.
                            Mr. GRESHAM complimented the intelligence and liberality of the
                                members of the State Board. This resolution provides damages and
                                rents.
                            Mr. FISHER. For damages. He was willing to amend it and add
                                rents.
                            Mr. GRESHAM. There is no doubt but that we ought to pay something for
                                use and occupation as well as damages. The only question is, whether
                                or not, at this particular time, the Board could not afford to hold
                                off. But I understand that this resolution authorizes the Governor
                                to settle a claim for damages, without limit. The State has got a
                                number of men quartered down in Wayne county, and we will be
                                expected to pay damages there.
                            Mr. NEWMAN. Wayne county will never ask it.
                            Mr. GRESHAM. But I am supposing what may come. The discretion in the
                                resolution is entirely too large.
                            Mr. ATKISSON suggested that there was a combination to pass this
                                resolution - to get the settlement of this claim into the hands of
                                one man, and subject him to importunities. He would have voted to
                                allow the claim at any proper time, but was opposed to this mode of
                                getting at it in the last hours of the session.
                            Mr. DAVIS. If we do not do something for this Society, the State
                                would lose what it has done in that direction. The resolution might
                                not be well enough guarded, but something ought to be done to enable
                                the Society to meet their liability on that land.
                            Mr. FISHER. This ground was purchased for the sum of $12,000, which
                                the various railroad companies, centering here, agreed to pay, in
                                annual instalments through ten years. But one of the conditions of
                                this was, that if the State Board should fail to hold the annual
                                fair, the railroads would be exhonorated from paying the instalment
                                that year. Then the failure to hold the fair this year will still
                                sink the Society deeper in debt. And if they were to hold a fair
                                this year, they would probably lose more than the amount of the
                                railroad instalment.
                            Mr. GRESHAM. I presume they would have held no fair if the ground had
                                not been occupied. I suppose, it will be enough if we  simply reimburse them for the damages.
                                I think it would not look well, at this time, for them to ask pay
                                for the use of the ground.
                            Mr. FRASIER took the ground that all the people of the State were
                                interested in the prosperity of the State Agricultural Society, and
                                at last, this appropriation of money was only taking from one fund
                                and paying it into another, when both belonged to the people. He
                                thought, even at this time, we should not lose sight of the great
                                interests of agriculture, upon which so much depends for the
                                prosperity of every other interest. He knew, of his own observation,
                                that a good deal of damage had been done to the Fair grounds. The
                                soldiers had cut the fence to pieces so that it would have to be
                                built over again; especially on the south side was this the case. To
                                remove the objection of committing the settlement to one man, he
                                moved that the auditing committee created by the additional general
                                appropriation bill, act with the Governor.
                            Mr. ATKISSON. Did not that bill fail?
                            Mr. FRASIER. I saw it this morning, and it was enrolled and signed by
                                the Governor.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG. The State was indebted for the use of the Fair
                                grounds, and ought to pay for it. But, since the gentleman from
                                Wabash,, [Mr. Fisher] who represents the interests of the society,
                                had not come in with the claim, until this late hour of the session,
                                he was unwilling to give the settlement entirely into the hands of
                                the Governor, without some further legislative guard; not that he
                                had not confidence In the Governor, but because the Governor was
                                burdened with too many concerns already.
                            Mr. FISHER. I was telegraphed for permission to occupy the Fair
                                grounds, and I took the responsibility to give the permission.
                            Mr. STOTSENBERG proposed the following: Strike out all between the
                                word "encampment," in the 8th line, and the word "and," in the 23d
                                line, and all between the word "thereon," in line 28, and
                                "therefore," in line 30. And insert, after the word "Governor," in
                                line 83, "and two members on the part of the House, with one on the
                                part of the Senate.
                            Mr. MOORMAN. This was not the time to set up a claim of this
                                character. Intimations had been given out of what the Board think
                                the damages ought to be, and what has been the advantage to the
                                State. He supposed there was room for great difference of opinion in
                                the matter. It should have been brought in earlier.
                            Mr. CASON. How could a bill be present-ed for damages when it is not
                                known how long the troops will occupy the grounds.
                            Mr. MOORMAN. But the award is to be final; and I am not willing to
                                leave the matter to any man - one, two or three - who will not be
                                responsible to this body. If there was time to consider it, and a
                                full house, I would not object.
                            Mr. BUNDY demanded the previous question, and there was a second.
                            Mr. LANE demanded the yeas and nays on the main question, viz.: the
                                adoption of the amendment.
                            Mr. CASON. We shall see now who are for the farmers - calling for the
                                yeas and nays, and so inevitably breaking up the bill.
                            [This question was laid over informally, by unanimous consent, and
                                the concurrent resolutions of the Senate, just reported by Mr.
                                Brown, their secretary, relative to the death of Col. Ellsworth,
                                were taken up and concurred in.]
                            Mr. LANE. If this matter had been put into the Appropriation bill I
                                would have voted for it.
                            The yeas and nays being now ordered and taken, disclosed no quorum
                                voting - yeas 30, nays 16.
                            Whereupon -
                            Mr. CASON demanded a call of the House.
                            The Clerk reported 48 members present.
                            On motion of Mr. McLean, the doorkeeper was dispatched for the
                                absentees.
                        
                        
                            AUDITING COMMITTEE.
                            The SPEAKER announced the Auditing Committee, on
                                the part of the House of Representatives, created by the additional
                                General Appropriation bill, No. 60, to consist of Messrs. Branham and Brett.
                            The House then took a recess till 2 o'clock, P. M.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The Doorkeeper made his return of the order of this morning, to bring
                                in the absentees; and the report showed 54 members present in the
                                House of Representatives.
                            Whereupon, it was held, unofficially, by the Chair,
                                that there was no quorum present; and it was -
                            Ordered that the names of the absentees, not on leave of absence, be

                                The Senate's concurrent resolution to wait on the Governor was
                                    adopted; and Messrs. Woodhull, Underwood and Smith of
                                    Bartholomew were appointed the committee on the part of the
                                    House of Representatives.
                                The Senate's resolution to adjourn at 11 o'clock was laid on the
                                    table.
                            
                            
                                DAMAGES ON THE STATE FAIR GROUNDS.
                                The Senate's concurrent resolution authorizing the Governor to
                                    settle with the State Board of Agriculture and award damages on
                                    account of the encampment of the troops on the State Fair
                                    Grounds coming up -
                                
                                Mr. FISHER moved its adoption.
                                After debate by Mr. Fisher, Mr. Frasier, Mr. Stotsenberg, and
                                    others, in favor of the resolution, and by Messrs. Underwood,
                                    Prosser, Parrett, Atkisson and others, against it,
                                On motion by Mr. UNDERWOOD, it was indefinitely postponed,
                                    without a division.
                            
                            
                                SENATOR BRIGHT.
                                On motion by Mr. FRASIER, the Senate's concurrent resolution with
                                    reference to the position of the Hon. Jesse D. Bright, a Senator
                                    of the United States for the State of Indiana, was taken up.
                                Mr. SMITH of Bartholomew. Mr. Speaker, I have heard different
                                    stories about that resolution. I have been told that it was
                                    introduced into the Senate in sport. I have been told by others
                                    that it was earnest business. It is said in that resolution that
                                    Mr. Bright refuses to respond to the call made upon members of
                                    Congress to define their position. But, sir, I have been
                                    informed by good authority - the brother of Mr. Bright - that he
                                    is now engaged preparing a document, to be circulated in this
                                    State, defining his position. I think, sir, that this is a very
                                    extraordinary proceeding - now in the last hours of the session,
                                    when we have but a handful of members present - to attempt to
                                    pass upon this matter - to attempt (as another gentleman here
                                    said yesterday) to single out Mr. Bright as the Judas Iscariot
                                    of the State of Indiana. Sir, there are leading men in the North
                                    who took the same position with Mr. Bright, in the late
                                    Presidential canvass, and who are now among our leading trusted
                                    men, bearing arms in defense of the General Government; and I
                                    believe that when Mr. Bright shows his hand, it will be for the
                                    Union. The gentleman to whom I refer is Major General Butler, of
                                    Massachusetts. What was his position in the Charleston
                                    Convention, this time last year? I was there myself, and
                                    understood it well. It was well known that the honorable
                                    Benjamin Butler came into the Charleston Convention pledged to
                                    vote for Douglas; and I saw him there publicly charged with
                                    changing his point, and he could not gainsay it; and singly and
                                    alone, among Northern delegates, he voted there for Jefferson
                                    Davis all the way through. Now, sir, many of these Northern men
                                    who stood with Butler then, are marching with him in the
                                    thickest of the fight for the defense of the Government on the
                                    field of battle. Democrats are in the army from every Northern
                                    State, perhaps equal in numbers with the Republicans, and they
                                    will fight side by side with the same good faith. Why, Mr.
                                    Speaker, when we came here in April, I understood that all
                                    political antecedants were to be buried and banished from our
                                    memory. And I am willing and proud to say that the Republicans
                                    have acted upon this profession, and were very liberal in
                                    dividing the offices. They showed a disposition to bury these
                                    things, and why? Simply because they saw that Douglas men
                                    throughout the North had responded foremost to the shouldering
                                    of their arms at the call of the President of the United States.
                                    I think, therefore, that, at this hour of the session, it is
                                    hardly ingenuous, or fair, or becoming in the Legislature to
                                    undertake to stab our Senator by passing this resolution. You
                                    remember, sir, what was said by the honorable Mr. Lane, the
                                    other night, from the Bates House, defining his own position as
                                    a member of Congress. He said that he believed that all our
                                    members of Congress, including Mr. Bright, are thoroughly and
                                    truly loyal. And we believe firmly that he is a loyal man, and
                                    that he will so declare himself in the address I am told he is
                                    preparing.
                                Mr. WOODHULL from the joint select committee to wait on the
                                    Governor and inform him of the adjournment, reported that the

                                    that His Excellency, the Governor, was at the time absent from
                                    home, on important public business.
                                On motion by Mr. STOTSENBERG, the House (at 4 o'clock,) adjourned

                                    proceed to procure the supplies named in said contract, or such

                                    and width the natural outlets and drains from such swamp or wet
                                    lands into or across adjoining lands belonging to any person or
                                    persons, by paying such person or persons the damage done to any
                                    such lands by such drains.
                                SEC. 2. It shall be lawful for any person or persons desirous of
                                    draining or ditching, as aforesaid, to enter at all times upon
                                    such adjoining lands for the purpose of deepening or widening
                                    such natural drains or out-lets, doing as little damage as
                                    possible to such adjoining lands.
                                SEC. 3. When the deepening, widening, and maintaining such drains
                                    or out-leis are of equal or greater benefit than the injury done
                                    to such adjoining lauds, no damage need be paid or tendered, but
                                    in cases where the same would be of greater damage than benefit
                                    to such lands of such other person, when the parties can not
                                    agree, such damage shall be assessed by three disinterested
                                    freeholders, and not of kin to either party, to be mutually
                                    chosen by the parties, and in case the parties can not agree,
                                    then the nearest justice of the peace, not being interested nor
                                    of kin to either party, shall appoint such appraisers.
                                SEC. 4. Any owner or owners of the same land who have drained wet
                                    or swamp lands thereon by deepening and widening the natural
                                    out-lets and channels therefrom running on, to, or across
                                    unsettled lands, which lands have been drained, improved, and
                                    riot injured thereby, shall have the right to maintain
                                    necessarily, deepen, and widen such natural out-lets or drains
                                    thereafter, only being answerable for unnecessary damage
                                    hereafter done in and about such deepening, widening, and
                                    maintaining.
                                SEC. 5. It shall be right for any owner or owners of wet or swamp
                                    lands to drain the  same at
                                    any time through their natural outlets, by deepening, widening,
                                    and maintaining such out-lets for any distance on the lands of
                                    others, only being answerable for any excess of damage above
                                    benefit he or they may so do to the lands of others.
                                SEC. 6. Should the owner of such other lands imagine they are
                                    damaged more than benefitted by such deepening, widening, and
                                    maintaining, when they are riot, he shall still have the right
                                    to have an assessment of damages, but if he fails to get an
                                    excess of damages he shall pay the cost of such unnecessary
                                    assessment, provided that it was his desire that such assessment
                                    be made.
                                SEC. 7. Any person so draining wet or swamp land may tender to
                                    any person a sum as excess of damages he may suppose he is doing
                                    to the land of such other persons by such draining. If such
                                    other person accepts, it shall be in full of damages, if he
                                    refuse to accept, and desire that the' excess of damages be
                                    assessed, then it shall be assessed as herein provided, but if
                                    such other person fail to recover an excess of damages above
                                    benefit, ns an award, he shall pay all the costs of such
                                    assessment.
