				<p>If Daniel Defoe had known the subject of this sketch-- and it is not beyond the bounds of
					possibility that he did, for he knew many such--and had he written this biography, which
					he of all men could have done best, it would probably have borne some such title, dear to
					his age and pen, as this:</p>
				<p>
					<hi rend="i">The Life and Strange, Surprising Adventures of John Scot, commonly called
						Colonel Scott; his early Experiences in America and the West Indies; his Career at
						Court; his Fortunes and Misfortunes as a Soldier; his Exploits as a Spy, Informer and
						Murderer; his Disgrace and Death; with some Notice of his Writings as Royal Geographer;
						and of the Glorious Restoration of his Reputation; together with Notes on his Fame as an
						Historian.</hi>
				</p>
				<p>No one would have believed that it was less a work of fiction than <hi rend="i">Captain
						Jack</hi>, or <hi rend="i">Moll Flanders</hi>; every one would have recognized it as
					peculiarly typical of the picaresque character in which he and his contemporaries
					delighted. That the tale which follows happens to be true--however far it falls short of
					Defoe's art--detracts in no way from its curious interest and adds to its value in
					explaining certain sides of late seventeenth century English and colonial history. Colonel
					Scott, with all of his impossibilities, was not only a very real man and one of the most
					picturesque and far-wandering scoundrels of his time, but he was an admirable
					representative of a not inconsiderable class of men who contributed something of
					importance and a great deal of color to the affairs of his generation.</p>
				<p>For the material contained in the following pages I am indebted to the sources quoted in
					the notes to be found at <pb id="VAB8204-013" n="[]"/>the end of the essay. I am under
					particular obligations to Mr. James Truslow Adams, the historian of Southampton, Long
					Island, who furnished me with many details from the records of that town. I am further
					indebted to him and to Professor J. Franklin Jameson for reading the essay in manuscript;
					and above all to the authorities of the Society of Colonial Wars of the State of New York,
					whose unfailing kindness has given this little study its present form. I can only hope
					that those into whose hands it may fall may obtain from it some of the entertainment and
					enlightenment which it has afforded me in preparing it. <hi rend="right">W.C.A.</hi></p>

				<head rend="center">COLONEL<lb/> JOHN SCOTT<lb/> OF<lb/> LONG ISLAND<lb/>
					1634(?)-1696</head>
				<p>To be a rascal is bad; to be a great rascal is doubtless worse; but to be embalmed in
					biographical dictionaries for pure rascality unadorned with the gilding of politics, of
					high finance, of romance, a rascality not even made respectable by success--of all
					failures in the conflict between man and oblivion this is perhaps the worst. To match
					one's wit against the world; to gain place and competence; to share in affairs which might
					almost be reckoned great; and, on the very threshold of achievement which would have
					drowned the memory of misdeeds and perpetuate one's name as soldier, savant, adventurer,
					empire-builder or what not, to find the way barred by duller and more honest men, or by
					more accomplished scoundrels--this is a hard case. And it is not lightened by the sight of
					luckier or more eminent associates going on to wealth and power and a certain measure of
					immortality while one is himself thrust back into the old nothingness again. Is not this
					the crowning tragedy of rascality? Such is the tragedy of John Scott, sometime colonist
					and soldier, sometime royal geographer and the agent if not the confidant of the great;
					always adventurer, and, save for circumstances beyond his wit and skill, and, we may add,
					perhaps beyond his character, lord of Long Island, and the founder of a fourteenth
					original colony in North America; now but the shadow of a shade of a dead rascal, whose
					life serves to while away <pb id="VAB8204-015" n="2"/>COLONEL JOHN SCOTT an hour or two,
					perhaps at best to point a moral and adorn a tale.</p>
				<p>If this were all, it would, perhaps, not be enough to justify any of that long and
					wearying research which, in such a case as his, resembles nothing so much as historical
					detective work. But it is not. The story of Scott did not end with his departure from the
					scene of his earthly activities. However numerous those activities while he was alive,
					they pale to insignificance before his achievements once he was in his grave; and it is in
					these no less, perhaps even more, than in the extraordinary circumstances of his life,
					that there lies whatever of value such a study as this contains of contribution to
					ultimate truth.</p>
				<p>That contribution is, on its face, not great. It may, in a sense, seem trivial; for it
					is, after all, only a story, and in many ways not even a pleasant story. It is a story
					without a hero, unless you may call its subject, who was a villain, by the more agreeable
					title. It is equally devoid of a moral; indeed its principal character is peculiarly
					notable for a conspicuous lack of morals. Finally, to complete the depressing catalogue of
					its unpleasant characteristics and so get them out of the way once for all, it has no
					particular bearing on the great problems which present themselves to us so urgently day by
					day,--unless it be that of the most fundamental of all problems, human nature itself. And,
					it is only fair to say, a good many persons have at one time or another, in various
					fashions and from the most diverse motives, told parts of it. No one hitherto has related
					it in its entirety, and that is, perhaps, after all, the principal value of this tale; for
					it happens to be one of those not uncommon things in the world whose whole is greater than
					the sum of its parts.</p>
				<p>Thus having in so far as possible dispelled any agreeable if mistaken anticipations with
					which any one may have <pb id="VAB8204-016" n="3"/> provided himself as an antidote for
					spending time in reading mere history; and having offered such reassurance as is possible
					that the story contains little which will either instruct or elevate the mind; it may be
					proper to add, by way of introduction, that this is a study of what is, so to speak, a
					cross-section not only of English and colonial, but of general seventeenth century
					history, seen chiefly, as it were, from the under side.</p>
				<p>The story begins, as it should, at the beginning, for two reasons. The first is because
					its earliest scenes are laid in that region and in that period which long conditioned the
					fortunes and misfortunes of its principal character--Long Island in the middle of the
					seventeenth century. The second is because the beginning of the tale is in a sense the
					type of the whole. For it begins in a Long Island jail.</p>
				<p>Some time in March of the year of our Lord 1654 there came to the attention of the
					authorities of New Amsterdam, then presided over by the redoubtable director general,
					Peter Stuyvesant, news of the activities of a certain young Englishman, known even then,
					it would appear, by the style or title of John Scott of Long Island. The Dutch it seems
					had for some time been annoyed by nocturnal raids on their property, and Scott's presence
					in the district from which he took his appellation, his character, his activities, a
					suspicion that he was concerned in these matters, or something about him, commended him so
					little to the Dutch colonists in that land then debatable between New England and New
					Netherland, that he was seized and clapped in jail as an undesirable citizen, together
					with four or five of his neighbors, including a certain Mr. Baxter who was to be
					associated with him in later years and under far different circumstances. Under such
					conditions John Scott made his somewhat inauspicious entry into history.</p>
				<p>Who he was, no one then or thereafter seems rightly to <pb id="VAB8204-017" n="4"/> have
					known; and though during a long and busy life he took great pains at many times to explain
					to a considerable number of people his precise origin and ancestry, the matter was not
					thereby much illuminated, partly for the reason that it did not always happen that any two
					of his explanations quite agreed with each other, and more largely for the still better
					reason that none of them agreed with the facts which other persons adduced from their
					knowledge of him. For the moment we may ignore his own story therefore, and confine
					ourselves to what his acquaintances and the official records declared of him from their
					own knowledge.</p>
				<p>From these it would appear that, about six years before his appearance in Long Island,
					Scott had been sentenced by the General Court of Massachusetts Bay to serve his master
					after his term of service 35 shillings worth, "or otherwise satisfy him." That master was
					one Lawrence Southwick, a Quaker, later banished from Massachusetts for his religion, and
					in the person of his wife, Cassandra, commemorated to posterity in one of Whittier's
					poems. How Scott came into Southwick's hands does not clearly appear; but there is
					evidence that, with other youths, he had been carried to Massachusetts as a bound-boy in
					the care of a certain Edmund Downing, about the year 1643. This story of his origin is
					partly confirmed, partly modified, by the fact that some years after he became a
					noteworthy figure in the colonies, a certain Captain Richard Nicolls, then secretary to
					the first English governor of New York, his kinsman, Colonel Richard Nicolls, testified
					that Scott "was born at Ashford, Kent, of very meane parentage, was bro't by his mother to
					New England, who lived miserable poore in this gov't, a poor bankrupt miller's wife till
					very lately next to want and beggary."</p>
				<p>The testimony is not identical but, despite the assertion <pb id="VAB8204-018" n="5"/> of
					the compiler of the American Scott genealogy that the young adventurer was "connected"
					with the Scotts of Scott's (or Scot's) Hall, in Kent, it is probable that this
					relationship was as shadowy as many of his other claims to lands and titles. The English
					family in later years denied with great bitterness his claim of relationship and his right
					to bear the arms of the family. And it is perhaps not without significance, in this
					connection, that, when he became established in his new home, he named his place in Long
					Island, not Mornamont, after the Kentish Scott family estate, but Ashford, which somehow
					seems to echo the English town with which he was most familiar before his emigration.</p>
				<p>But if he lacked lineage and arms, he did possess something perhaps almost if not quite
					as useful. For some time after his arrival on Long Island he seems to have lived a good
					deal among the Indians and traded on his own account. And, "having a nimble genius, tho'
					otherwise illiterate, with the help of a little reading, having a good memory and greater
					confidence, he became somewhat above the common people," indulging in somewhat various and
					devious activities whose immediate end we have seen in what may be called, in the language
					of Dr. Watson and Mr. Sherlock Holmes, "The Adventure of the Long Island Jail."</p>
				<p>It is scarcely surprising that the Dutch showed such little appreciation of Scott's
					peculiar talents at such a time and under such circumstances as those which he selected to
					make his entry into politics. However that era was adapted to his gifts, it was not one
					which commended restless and intriguing Englishmen like him to the inhabitants of the New
					Netherlands. It was a trying period for Hollanders everywhere, but most especially to
					those on Long Island. England had just transformed her Commonwealth into a <pb
						id="VAB8204-019" n="6"/> Protectorate, with Oliver Cromwell at its head. She was,
					moreover, just emerging from a war with Holland, in which she had been successful enough
					to break the hold of the Dutch carrying monopoly which they had enjoyed for nearly a
					generation. She was on her way to war with Spain; and, with the triumphs of her great
					admirals over the old masters of the sea, it seemed not improbable that she would
					presently come to dominate the element on which Holland depended for its living, almost
					for its life.</p>
				<p>And if the situation was bad for the Dutch in Europe, it was worse for the Dutch in
					America. A generation earlier their traders had begun to plant their posts along the
					Hudson at the same moment that the English had begun to settle on Massachusetts Bay. From
					those two points each side had made its way along the coast and into the interior.
					Moreover the Swedes had begun a settlement on the Delaware, and New Netherland found
					itself, in consequence, hemmed in by New England on the one side and New Sweden on the
					other. The latter was easily disposed of; and in the very days that Scott found his way to
					jail, the Dutch conquered and absorbed the Swedish settlements. But the English were
					tougher antagonists. In the thirty-five years since the foundation of Plymouth, they had
					spread northward to the Kennebec and south and west to Rhode Island and Connecticut. They
					had settled at Saybrook and so secured the mouth of the Connecticut River; they had built
					a town at Hartford, and planted a colony at New Haven. They had spread into Long Island
					and were now in fairly secure possession of the Connecticut valley which had been disputed
					between them and the Dutch, together with the eastern end of the island opposite. Thence
					they had pushed westward until, at the very door of Manhattan, their pioneers had begun to
					colonize the Westchester district.</p>


				<pb id="VAB8204-020" n="7"/>

				<p>With the rise of England and the decline of Holland on the sea, it was thus becoming
					evident that, short of some miraculous reversal of fortune, the days of the ascendancy of
					New Netherland were numbered. Under such circumstances English agitators were naturally
					peculiarly distasteful to the Dutch, and especially to such men as the director-general,
					Stuyvesant. Scott was carried to New Amsterdam, there examined, and ultimately released,
					doubtless with stern admonitions to go, and sin no more.</p>
				<p>He seems to have passed the next few years in the pursuit of a more or less honest
					livelihood. It would appear from some later statements that he divided his time between
					the exercise of his profession as a blacksmith and the raising of cattle, or, as it was
					less elegantly expressed by his contemporaries, "keeping cowes." But these pursuits by no
					means exhausted his energies. He had already turned his attention to the chief source of
					wealth in a new country-land; and even before his entry into international affairs, he had
					found opportunity to exercise his gifts in that direction. For that, the time and place
					were peculiarly favorable. When he had been released from his obligations to Massachusetts
					justice he seems to have made his way to Connecticut, thence to the oldest settlement on
					Long Island,--the oldest English settlement, indeed, within the present boundaries of New
					York, the town of Southampton, which thenceforth for some years became the center of his
					activities.</p>
				<p>He chose well. As towns went in those days Southampton was already well established. It
					had been founded about 1639 or 1640 by emigrants chiefly from Lynn, under the lead of
					Edward Howell, Edward Cooper, and the minister, Abraham Pierson, the father of the first
					president of Yale College. This party of some forty families had, according to the custom
					of the time, formed a <pb id="VAB8204-021" n="8"/> company, and secured a concession from
					one Farrett, the agent of that Sir William Alexander, Earl of Stirling, to whom James I
					had granted and Charles I confirmed rights over nearly all the best portions of northern
					North America, but whose chief source of revenue had thus far been the sale of Nova
					Scotian baronetcies and the rights of colonizing Long Island. For this land there were
					already two claimants besides--the Dutch of New Amsterdam and the settlers of the recently
					planted colonies of Connecticut and especially New Haven opposite; and these, as well as
					the new colonists from Lynn, were to play no small part in the fortunes of Scott.</p>
				<p>Those colonists almost at once came into collision with the Dutch, and, driven from their
					first landing-place at Schout's Bay by a force from New Amsterdam, they had sought out the
					Earl's agents at New Haven and from them secured a deed by which, in consideration of
					£400, they were permitted to make terms with the Indians for the eastern end of Long
					Island, where by June 1640 they seem to have established themselves. The colony had
					flourished from the beginning. Not only was the climate peculiarly agreeable; the tillable
					land, once it was cleared, sufficiently fertile; but the sea was full of whales,
					"crampasses," and seals, from which oil could be extracted, and teeming with fish and
					oysters. By the time of Scott's arrival the settlement was already outgrowing its
					boundaries; and a year before his arrest he had signalized his advent into the real-
					estate field by selling to its directors the adjoining district of Quogue, which he had
					bought from one Ogden, who had acquired it from the Indians.</p>
				<p>The passion for land speculation never left him; and his stay in Southampton was filled
					with his activities in that field. The records of the settlement in the years between 1660
					and 1664 are filled with accounts of his land transfers. <pb id="VAB8204-022" n="9"/> For
					the tracts which he conveyed, he claimed to have--and possibly did have--deeds from the
					Indian sachem Wayandanck and his son Weacham; but the real titles seem to have resided
					principally in his own too exuberant imagination, and that of the savage chieftains. They
					long remained to vex the colony; and, however sacred the ceremony of transfer "by turf and
					twig" which gave them into his hands, there is at least one instance which sheds some
					light upon his character and activities. For in 1664 when the people of Seetauket
					purchased land of the "Sachem of Uncachage, Tobacus," they insisted on that noble savage
					adding to the instrument these words: "Further saith that he sold no land to John
					Scott."</p>
				<p>Besides his canny forehandedness he seems to have shown other traits. A month after his
					arrest he was defendant in a suit for defamation in New Haven. Three years later he was
					made a freeman of Southampton, was granted a house-lot there, was appointed one of the tax
					commissioners; was suing and being sued by his neighbors, chiefly about land; married
					Deborah, daughter of one Joseph Raynor of that place; acted as attorney--among other
					things for a "whale company"; and still later to determine the town boundaries. But
					through it all ran the <hi rend="i">motif</hi> of land, and the continual suspicion that
					his titles and transfers were more or less questionable. In short he appears to have been
					one of the first--in view of later happenings one hesitates to say the worst--of that
					long. line of plausible individuals who have seen in Long Island real-estate the true El
					Dorado so long and so vainly sought by Spanish explorers in South America. Meanwhile, too,
					he rose in the world. For whereas he was not long since described as "John Scott, Smith,"
					he now appears as "Captain John Scott."</p>


				<pb id="VAB8204-023" n="10"/>

				<p>Thus ended the first period of his long and active career. Whether he was moved by the
					suggestions of those whom he involved in his real-estate transactions, or whether he
					sought a wider field for his rapidly developing talents, about the end of the year 1660 he
					set sail for England. To that next scene of his activities he seems to have carried three
					things, each of some significance in its way. The first and most important was himself,
					his abilities and his ambitions; the second was a collection of curiosities, not otherwise
					identified; the third was a copy of a book printed two years before in Cambridge, Abraham
					Pierson's volume entitled <hi rend="i">"Some Helps for the Indians, Shewing them how to
						improve their Natural Reason to know the true God and the Christian Religion."</hi></p>
				<p>This last seems, on the whole, a peculiar piece of property for him to cherish, nor one
					calculated to advance the fortunes of a Long Island real-estate dealer at the court of his
					gracious Majesty King Charles the Second, of somewhat less than blessed memory. Just how
					the book in question may have helped the Indians one extract may reveal. "How," says this
					admirable work, "do you prove that there is but one true God?" "Because," it answers
					itself, "singular things of the same kind when they are multiplied are differenced among
					themselves by their peculiar properties; but there cannot be found another God
					differentiated from this by any such like properties." This, and much more to the same
					purpose, was set forth in the no doubt pleasing but comparatively rudimentary vocabulary
					of the Quiripi dialect, in which it seems, if possible, less comprehensible than in its
					original tongue. It may be hoped that it was more so; but it was never translated, as was
					originally planned, into Narragansett, and the natives of Rhode Island were, in
					consequence, deprived of the privilege of possessing a volume which would doubtless <pb
						id="VAB8204-024" n="11"/> have been of incalculable intellectual as well as spiritual
					importance to their development.</p>
				<p>But however little it may have helped the Indians, it may seem still more surprising that
					Scott imagined that this pearl of missionary literature could have helped him. The
					explanation is simple enough, though it might not occur at once to the ordinary mind. But
					Scott's was no ordinary mind. The book bore on its original title-page a statement that it
					had been "examined and approved by Thomas Stanton, Interpreter General to the United
					Colonies." The copy which Scott exhibited with just pride to his new English acquaintances
					was precisely like the original with one slight exception. Its title-page announced to the
					reader that the volume had been "examined and approved by that Experienced Gentleman (in
					the <hi rend="i">Indian</hi> Language) Captain John Scot." And it has been perhaps not
					unnaturally supposed by the learned antiquarians, who nearly two hundred years later
					interested themselves in this earliest product of Scott's literary skill, that the
					ingenious gentleman had found an obliging printer in London who was good enough to print
					the title-page thus simply but effectively altered to suit the new circumstances and
					company in which the book found itself--and so further the natural ambition of a rising
					young man by commending him to his new friends as a useful agent of his native land in its
					North American possessions, perhaps in some lucrative official capacity.</p>
				<p>If there were any doubt that Scott had a genius for the exercise of certain arts by which
					men rise in the world it would be at once dissipated by the mere fact that he came to
					England when he did. The situation might have been made to his hand. The king had just
					been restored. The court was full of needy adventurers and still needier royalists, of
					whom King Charles himself was chief. The <pb id="VAB8204-025" n="12"/> country was, for
					the moment, in a ferment of loyalty; and what was more to the purpose, the unsettled
					situation of affairs left over from the civil wars and the interregnum, the difficulty of
					distinguishing true claims from false, and more especially honest men from rogues, offered
					an unparalleled opportunity to men not over-scrupulous to advance their fortunes. This
					Scott could scarcely have known in its entirety when he made his exit from Long Island,
					but that he grasped its significance so quickly and so immediately set himself to take
					advantage of the blessing fortune had put in his way argues again the adaptable and
					resourceful qualities which the man possessed, to an even greater degree than his happy
					inspiration in regard to the title-page of the missionary volume. It argues still more,
					for it reveals that imaginative quality which was so eminent a feature of his intellectual
					equipment.</p>
				<p>Moreover, there is one other circumstances to be taken into account in connection with
					Scott's advent in England in the year of the Restoration. Whatever the importance of the
					reign of Charles II in other fields, in that of colonial development it was one of the
					principal epochs in English history. In the preceding forty years there had been
					established in North America a series of settlements which extended from Virginia and
					Maryland on the south through New Sweden, New Netherland, New Haven, Connecticut, Rhode
					Island, Massachusetts, Plymouth, New Hampshire, and the Kennebec region to New France
					along the lower St. Lawrence. The greater part of these colonies were English, and the
					troubles of the reign of Charles I had poured into them a population which made them the
					largest European society outside of Europe. The various colonies had found their legal
					status a matter of considerable concern in the face of the civil disturbances in England;
					and when the Restoration of Charles seemed to promise settled <pb id="VAB8204-026" n="13"
					/> government, they hastened to have their various privileges confirmed or enlarged by
					royal charter. In consequence every colony deputed representatives to protect its
					interests, and among the strange faces with which London was filled in the early days of
					the new reign, those of the colonial agents were conspicuous. From Boston came Samuel
					Maverick to represent the interests of Massachusetts; from Rhode Island came George Baxter
					to second the efforts of Clarke and urge the cause of the English in territories claimed
					by the Dutch; from Virginia came Governor Berkeley; from Connecticut came Governor John
					Winthrop --and from Long Island came Captain John Scott.</p>
				<p>In addition to this there was another element involved. The royalists had come back for
					the most part stripped of their old inheritance by the catastrophe which had overtaken
					their party in the preceding twenty years. The number of places and pensions which England
					itself afforded fell far short of the number of those who pressed their claims on the new
					administration. The needy royalists were not long in perceiving that the rapid development
					of the colonies, and the possibility of forming new colonies, offered opportunities for
					increase in their fortunes. In consequence, amid the manifold activities which the court
					and council of Charles II revealed in these early years, colonial projects were
					conspicuous. From the Lord Chancellor, Clarendon, down, the courtiers bestirred themselves
					in colonial, and presently commercial projects, as their predecessors of Elizabethan times
					had busied themselves with privateering schemes to spoil the Spaniard.</p>
				<p>These were supplemented by the issue of new grants and charters which, in effect,
					reorganized the British colonial empire. A year before Charles II returned to England the
					Virginians had proclaimed him King of England, Scotland, Ireland and Virginia, and
					restored the royal governor, Sir <pb id="VAB8204-027" n="14"/> William Berkeley, who made
					his way to England on the Restoration to plead in vain for the amelioration of the
					Navigation Act and a guarantee for her constitution. And scarcely had the Restoration been
					accomplished when Lord Culpepper, one of the members of the Plantations Committee, began
					those plans to acquire a hold over the loyal colony which bore fruition a dozen years
					later in a grant to him and to Arlington of its rights for a generation, and perhaps
					contributed to the so-called Bacon's Rebellion.</p>
				<p>Among the earliest acts of the new government had been the appointment of Clarendon and
					seven others to act as a council for the colonies, and through that body came a
					reorganization of the plantations in America. In 1662 the charter of Connecticut was
					granted by the king at the solicitation of the Connecticut agent, John Winthrop, who for
					fourteen years thereafter was annually chosen its governor. By that charter, much against
					its will, New Haven was annexed to Connecticut, whose boundaries were extended from the
					Narragansett river to the Pacific Ocean. At the same time the government of Maryland was
					confirmed to Lord Baltimore, and in the following year Baxter brought to Rhode Island the
					charter which had been obtained through the exertions of Clarke. At the same time, too,
					the lands south of Virginia were erected into the province of Carolina and granted to
					Clarendon and his associate, Berkeley. Finally, to make the story complete, when, a few
					years later, England seized New Netherland, the king granted to his brother, the Duke of
					York, the lands between the Connecticut and the Delaware; and James in turn gave to his
					followers, Berkeley and Carteret, the land between the Hudson and the Delaware. Thus,
					within five years after the Restoration, all the colonies of North America, save
					Massachusetts, had been given new charters or new masters. And it is perhaps no wonder
					that Scott, <pb id="VAB8204-028" n="15"/> surrounded by this atmosphere, conceived that he
					too might profit by the general distribution of lands and offices. He thereupon bestirred
					himself to share in this windfall.</p>
				<p>The methods which he adopted were characteristic of the man and the situation in which he
					found himself. Under the circumstances it seemed fairly apparent to many men of his kind
					and of even meaner intelligence that whether or not Charles II was the fountain of honor
					and justice, he was certainly the fountain of pensions and patronage. In common,
					therefore, with a horde of other adventurers, Scott cast about for the best way to
					approach this potential source of benefits. After the manner of his kind, he took what
					seemed the most direct path to the royal presence--by way of the back stairs. He made
					friends with one Thomas Chiffinch, custodian of the royal jewels, "keeper of rarities,"
					page of the closet, and, above all, brother of that William Chiffinch of unsavory memory,
					who was the chief panderer to the royal pleasures. He scraped acquaintance with a certain
					Joseph Williamson, then secretary to that Henry Bennet who was even then on his way to
					place and fortune and the title of Earl of Arlington. Under such auspices Scott went to
					court, met Bennet himself, and gained interest with a "potent gentleman," by presenting
					him with a parcel of curiosities valued at £60. And whither his ambitions tended may be
					judged by the fact that in May, 1661, it was reported through Long Island that the king
					had bestowed upon him that entire region.</p>
				<p>The report was not true, but it was not Scott's fault that it was false. There was some
					ground for the rumor. He had, indeed, petitioned for such a grant; and it even seemed for
					a time that he might achieve his purpose. But among the many characteristics which make
					Scott's career so interesting, one is conspicuous. It is what he and men <pb
						id="VAB8204-029" n="16"/> like him usually call ill-luck. For while his petition was
					still pending in this winter of 1661-2, there arrived in London no less a person than John
					Winthrop the younger, chief magistrate of Connecticut, seeking a new charter for his
					colony. As events were to prove there were few men in the world whose advent at this
					moment Scott ought to have feared more than that of Winthrop. Connecticut was not only
					anxious to have its charter rights secured; the colony, or some of its members, were
					exceedingly anxious to obtain title to Long Island, or at least that precise part from
					which Scott came. And not only were Winthrop's ambitions certain to clash with those of
					Scott, but it is not improbable that Winthrop knew of Scott's past. As between the
					governor of a commonwealth and a needy adventurer, there could be small doubt which way
					the authorities would incline. But Scott made the best of it. He promptly sought out and
					endeavored to attach himself to Winthrop, though at first, naturally, with small success.
					Despite this, Scott's petition was denied in the following spring for reasons which may
					well be imagined and which presently appeared.</p>
				<p>This was, of course, a blow. But your true adventurer is not a man to be daunted by a
					single reverse, nor is he accustomed to carry all his eggs in one basket. While Scott had
					been playing his part before court and council, he had been notably busy in other and less
					public capacities. The story may be briefly told. Somewhere in those busy days of 1661, he
					met in London a certain Daniel Gotherson, Quaker, sometime an officer in the Cromwellian
					army, more recently a tradesman in London, and a spy for the government among his old
					associates, some of whom were more than suspected of treasonable practices. Moreover, by
					some curious and unfortunate chance for him, this worthy gentleman was possessed of some
					lands on Long <pb id="VAB8204-030" n="17"/> Island which he had acquired many years
					before. His wife was a lady of some reputation as an exhorter among the sect to which she
					and her husband belonged. Her maiden name was Dorothea Scott, of Scott's Hall in Kent.
					Upon the ground of similarity of name Captain Scott-- with that ready wit and that
					openness to opportunity in whatever form it presented itself to him--promptly claimed
					relationship with Mrs. Gotherson; and had that claim admitted, chiefly, it would appear,
					on the ground of his real or fancied resemblance to certain family portraits preserved in
					Scott's Hall. It is, moreover, not improbable that here, as at a later period, he was
					aided in his ingratiating design by his early Quaker connection with Southwick, from whom,
					and from Mrs. Gotherson, he derived a certain fluency in the peculiar dialect affected by
					that sect which was of much use to him both then and thereafter.</p>
				<p>At all events the new acquaintance, cemented by a common interest in Long Island
					real-estate, which has always been famous for bringing together the most diverse
					characters by its peculiar charm, prospered so rapidly and so completely that from these
					slender premises Scott presently drew a great and characteristic conclusion. By the middle
					of 1662 he had devised one of the most remarkable instruments of a career peculiarly
					notable for remarkable documents. It runs as follows: "I, John Scott, of Ashford, on Long
					Island, in the south part of New England, Esquire, doe authorize Daniell Gotherson,
					Esquire, of Egerton in Kent, my true and lawfull attorney for me, and in my name and for
					my use to treat for 20,000 acres of land lying and being on the South side of Long Island,
					and between Acombamook and ye land of the aforesaid Daniell Gotherson, lying by Uncochuag
					on the south side of ye marsh land of the said John Scott, on which it butts South, <pb
						id="VAB8204-031" n="18"/> and thereupon to conclude for such sum or summes of money as
					he in his prudence shall thinke a fitt consideration for ye whole or any part of ye said
					20,000 acres so soulled, I hereby promise to ratify and confirme under my hand and seale,
					if ther be any deficiency in ye grants granted by ye said Daniell Gotherson, and to ye
					performance of premises I bind myselfe, heirs, Executors, and assigns" &amp;c.</p>
				<p>To this Scott added an agreement to protect Gotherson's property against the sachems
					Wackcombwin and Wyandanchchase, together with certain other documents of like import and
					equal value. These he sealed with his newly-acquired signet bearing his coat of
					arms--which seems to have been the property of Mrs. Gotherson! It is not easy to
					comprehend how the human mind works, especially in the presence of a superior
					intelligence; but it is certainly a tribute to Scott's undoubted charm that the Gothersons
					were under the impression they were purchasing land from Scott; and that when some three
					years later Daniel Gotherson died, he bequeathed these mythical Long Island estates to his
					surviving heirs. It is perhaps even more to the point to observe that, as a tangible
					result of these documents, Scott came into possession of some £2,000 of Gotherson's
					money.</p>
				<p>Having thus provided himself with the sinews of war, he turned again with fresh
					confidence to public life. He consorted with the colonial representatives in London,
					especially with Hooke of Massachusetts and Winthrop of Connecticut; and in particular, he
					put himself in touch with the affairs of the so-called Atherton Company. And with this we
					come upon another and peculiarly characteristic example of seventeenth century colonial
					enterprise. For this association, which played no small part in the affairs of New
					England, was a typical product of the period in which it flourished, and its history
					throws much light upon <pb id="VAB8204-032" n="19"/> the methods by which certain phases
					of early colonial development were conditioned.</p>
				<p>The facts are briefly these. The Rhode Island Plantation, as is generally known, was
					founded between 1636 and 1640 by Roger Williams and others, among whom was a certain John
					Clarke, who fled or were driven out by persecution from Massachusetts. The four original
					settlements were united in 1647 under the authority of a patent issued three years earlier
					by the Parliamentary board of Commissioners for the Plantations; though the two divisions
					of Providence and Rhode Island were separated for a time in 1654. Thus far all seems clear
					enough. But in those days of unsettled politics and still more unsettled boundaries,
					certain ambitious gentlemen of Massachusetts, known from their moving spirit, one Colonel
					or Major Atherton, as the Atherton Company, conceived the idea of acquiring from the
					Indians west of the Narragansett a tract of land, and there establishing a new colony,
					despite the fact that the territory in question was included in the Rhode Island grant.
					They were somewhat aided in this philanthropic design by the fact that there was in
					existence a patent for those lands, professing to have been issued in 1643, but which, it
					seems, was not signed by the proper persons and therefore presumably not valid.</p>
				<p>Upon these somewhat slender premises they applied to the government of Charles II for a
					patent for their claim, endeavoring to have it removed from the jurisdiction of the Rhode
					Island and Providence plantations and annexed either to Massachusetts or Connecticut. In
					this they were more or less abetted by the authorities of the latter colonies, by John
					Winthrop in particular; and to this end they employed also the talents of Scott. For a
					time it seemed that they might put their scheme through. But, unfortunately for them, John
					Clarke, the able and honest <pb id="VAB8204-033" n="20"/> representative of the original
					proprietors, was still in England, and he now used his best endeavors to block the
					progress of this promising land deal. On the side of the Atherton Company Scott engaged
					the interest of Chiffinch, who was taken into the Society; and a petition was preferred
					against Clarke and his associates as "enimys to the peace and well-being of his Majesty's
					good subjects."</p>
				<p>This project was, for the time being, successful. A letter was secured from the King, and
					countersigned by Bennet, commending the Atherton associates to the "neighborly kindness
					and protection" of the four New England colonies, Massachusetts, Plymouth, New-Haven and
					Connecticut, and urging that the proprietors be permitted "peaceably to improve their
					colony and plantation in New England," the King, "having been given to understand that his
					good subjects, Thomas Chiffinch, John Scott, John Winthrop and others were daily disturbed
					and unjustly molested in their possessions by certain unreasonable and turbulent spirits
					of Providence Colony." These latter conceived themselves to be, and probably were, the
					rightful owners of the land in question, so that their unreasonableness and turbulence
					were perhaps not unnatural under the circumstances, nor were they much soothed by the
					royal admonition, nor, indeed, much terrified by royal authority.</p>
				<p>Such were the proceedings to which the authorities of Massachusetts and Connecticut lent
					themselves with such excellent results. There was only one flaw in the scheme. While the
					Atherton Company had been busy with its back-stairs influence, Clarke had gone on the
					straight and narrow path which led, as it proved in this case, to success. The
					extraordinary letter which the conspirators had extracted from an easy-going king,
					obtained, as it were, by stealth, was not a document which stood the light of day. It was
					unknown to or ignored by the Council of which the <pb id="VAB8204-034" n="21"/> minister,
					Clarendon, the enemy of Bennet, was the head. Seventeen days after the letter came into
					being, the Council passed under the Great Seal a royal charter to Rhode Island, which
					nullified the provisions of the letter and after a long period of dispute, finally brought
					the machinations of the Atherton Company to naught.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile Scott had evolved another scheme. At the very moment that he was thus being
					endorsed by Charles, he was petitioning that monarch for office; and the petition is
					worthy of notice, if only on biographical grounds. Scott's father, it recited, had been an
					ardent royalist during the late disturbances. He had not merely given his life to the
					royal cause; what was more to the present purpose, he had sold an estate of £200 per annum
					and advanced to Charles I no less than £14,300. Scott himself had been transported to New
					England, he averred, for his attachment to the crown; his "small expression of loyalty"
					having been made, as he phrased it, "by cutting the bridles and girts of some of the then
					Parliament's horses at Turnham Green." He went on to say that he had been brought before a
					Parliament committee, by whom, in spite of his giving them £500, he was sent to New
					England in the care of one Downing and abused. He had bought near a third of Long Island;
					and in consequence of these facts he begged Charles to make him governor of that province
					and the adjacent islands, or at least allow the inhabitants to choose their own governor
					and assistants yearly. The petition was favorably received by the king, who was "most
					graciously inclined to encourage it." It was referred to the committee on Foreign
					Plantations, and there for a time the matter rested.</p>
				<p>While it was being considered, Scott took another step, the first, as it was to prove,
					though he did not guess it, in a great and unscrupulous design of far-reaching <pb
						id="VAB8204-035" n="22"/> consequence. Upon his complaint that the Dutch had intruded on
					the New England mainland and islands, especially on Manhattan and Long Island, an order in
					Council directed Captain Scott, Mr. Maverick and Mr. Baxter, formerly of New Netherland,
					to draw up a narrative of the English king's title to that district, the Dutch intrusion,
					their "deportment, management, strength, trade and government, and means to make them
					acknowledge His Majesty's sovereignty." And it is not too much to suppose that they drew
					it strong, for each of them, in his peculiar way, wanted something which a transfer of
					Dutch territories to English hands would or might have given him.</p>
				<p>How deep the design was which now enlisted them in its toils they could not well have
					known; for it was as yet probably no more than a suggestion, susceptible of a variety of
					interpretations, and a still larger number of possible courses of action. But, as events
					were soon to demonstrate, Scott was at the beginning of a policy, which he seems to have
					done much to suggest, of the utmost importance not only to his adopted home in America but
					to England and the British Empire generally. And this already gives him a certain
					historical importance.</p>

				<p>Meanwhile he had not neglected his interests in America. In these same busy days he had
					several letters from one Captain John Leverett, then titular "governor of Boston," in
					regard to the Scott claims--one dare not say estates-- on Long Island. From these it would
					appear that Leverett, who seems to have been induced to act as Scott's agent, had been to
					Long Island to see about the payment of bills drawn by Scott upon his old neighbors, or
					the occupiers of the lands he professed to own in that region. Leverett's visit was
					unfruitful, for he writes that these stubborn people had not only taken time to consider
					whether they should pay, but that they had sent a certain Captain Young as their <pb
						id="VAB8204-036" n="23"/> representative to Boston, to ask for the original writing by
					which Scott was entitled to payment--Leverett having only a copy! Upon the latter's
					failure to produce the original patent, Young departed; and, Leverett wrote, the
					contumacious party which sent him showed "very unbecoming jealousyes about your actings
					respecting the writing, and also some affirmations about the deed of purchase you have for
					the tract of land." There was, it appeared from Captain Young, "no expectation of payment
					to be had" from them. Moreover, Captain Scott's lady had requisitioned from the confiding
					Leverett divers things which he had supplied, including some thousands of feet of lumber,
					for which he desired payment to one Francis Smith, then on the way to England, together
					with various sums advanced by Leverett on Scott's account to several persons whom he
					enumerates.</p>
				<p>One would like to think that Leverett got his money back. Perhaps he did, though it seems
					at this distance somewhat improbable. But if he did not, it was certainly not because
					Scott was in want of funds. By the time Leverett's letter advising him of the approach of
					Smith had been despatched, he had received the decision of the Plantations Committee on
					his petition for the governorship of Long Island. Despite his moving account of his
					father's sufferings and his own, his request was politely but firmly denied for a variety
					of reasons, some of which, at least, appeared in the sequel. And, upon this, having
					exhausted his not inconsiderable ingenuity for the time, he set sail for America in the
					fall of 1663. He did not go empty-handed; for though he had been disappointed in his
					dearest hopes of land grants and office, he had substantial consolation. He carried with
					him certainly some part of Gotherson's £2,000, and, incidentally, Gotherson's man Prior to
					manage the Long Island estates. He was accompanied <pb id="VAB8204-037" n="24"/> by
					Gotherson's son, whom, with some other youths, he had induced to accompany him to America
					by hope of preferment there; and these, on his arrival, he promptly sold into service for
					sums which probably recompensed him for the expense of the voyage. He had, moreover, taken
					the precaution before his departure to secure Mrs. Gotherson's jewels to the value of some
					£200, which also accompanied him to America. Moreover, he had been commissioned apparently
					to bring over the Privy Council's instructions regarding the Navigation Acts and was thus
					enabled to return in a quasi-official capacity. So, taking all these items into
					consideration, with all his disappointments he had concluded a not unprofitable venture.
					And with it there ended another stage of his active career.</p>
				<p>It is apparent in the mere statement of the case that his second appearance on Long
					Island was of a very different character from his first. He was now more experienced in
					the ways of the great world. He was a man of substance if not of much real property; he
					had been at court and talked with the king; he had even been received into royal favor. He
					had money to spend; and it was not his fault that he did not bear his Majesty's commission
					beside. No one as yet knew, in fact, that he did not. With that thought a new and
					brilliant idea took form in his fertile brain and presently produced consequences of no
					small importance to him and to others. Why should they know? Why should they not remain in
					that agreeable state of ignorance?</p>
				<p>He was, in a sense, a representative of the English government; he had done something at
					least to direct their minds to a new policy; it may well be that he had received a hint of
					what that policy might be, and of possible rewards which might accrue to him were it
					successful and his actions agreeable to its promoters. All this was soon reflected in his
					activities. Before Christmas 1663, Colonel <pb id="VAB8204-038" n="25"/> Scott, for so he
					now aspired to be called, was reported buying lands of the Indians, and exercising himself
					in requiring the enforcement of the Navigation Act against English goods being carried in
					Dutch ships. He got himself appointed, apparently on the strength of this, one of three
					commissioners empowered by Connecticut to settle the differences with the Dutch of Long
					Island; and he wrote to his friend Williamson, prematurely, that the English on the west
					end of Long Island, long enslaved by the Dutch, had rebelled, with the assistance of
					Connecticut, and desired that Williamson prevent any trouble with the Dutch ambassador
					until New England could be heard.</p>
				<p>By the fourth of January, 1664, on the strength of his assertion that the King had
					granted Long Island to the Duke of York, Flushing, Hastings, Oyster Bay and other towns
					had formed a confederation. He had had himself made "president" of the English towns on
					Long Island and within a week thereafter, followed by 170 men, he had invaded Breuckelen
					and the neighboring towns "with sounding trumpet, beaten drum, flying colors, great noise
					and uproar," declaring England owned the land and that he himself would run Governor
					Stuyvesant through. To demonstrate his valor he even struck a little Dutch boy who refused
					to take off his hat to the English flag, harangued the people at Midwout "like a
					quacksalver," but failed to shake their allegiance, and so proceeded to Amersfoort and New
					Utrecht, where his men seized the blockhouse and fired a royal salute. He was now at the
					climax of his American reputation. New Haven instructed a committee to treat with him
					about a patent for Delaware; Connecticut made him a magistrate on Long Island. In this
					capacity he met the Dutch commissioners, and exhibited to them a patent from Charles II
					granting to him the whole of Long Island--which only lacked that <pb id="VAB8204-039"
						n="26"/> monarch's signature to make it valid! The Dutch bent to the storm. They
					extracted from Scott an agreement that he would leave their towns unmolested for a month,
					though Scott declared that he would return in the spring with the Duke of York and secure
					not only Long Island but all New Netherland for the English crown. In the face of this
					declaration, however, the Dutch authorities induced him, some six weeks later, to extend
					immunity for a year--and meanwhile they prepared for war.</p>
				<p>Never was a demonstration better timed; but had Scott known just what was in the minds of
					the English court it is possible he would not have lent himself so readily to this course
					of action. For, consciously or unconsciously, he had suggested a brilliant and wholly
					unscrupulous design to the party about the Duke of York, to which the King, as usual, lent
					himself. The accusations against the Dutch drawn up by Scott, Maverick and Baxter served
					as its foundation. But there were other stones in the edifice. For a variety of reasons
					the court had decided on war with Holland; but it was impossible for the court of Charles
					II to follow a straight and honorable course. The war was desired partly for reasons of
					state, but more largely for reasons of profit to the court. A sum was subscribed among the
					war party, two expeditions were projected, and for them the King's authority to provide a
					fleet was secured. Sir Robert Holmes was despatched to attack the Dutch posts in Africa;
					another expedition under the command of Colonel Richard Nicolls was prepared to act
					against New Netherland. That province was granted by Charles to his brother, the Duke of
					York; and in May, 1664, Nicolls sailed to secure the territory already disposed of. Thus
					in the very days that Scott engineered his demonstration against the Dutch--perhaps with
					the connivance of his English associates--and so made a <pb id="VAB8204-040" n="27"/>
					pretext for hostilities, the stake for which he played was given to another. And, had
					Scott no other claim to the attention of history, the fact that he was one of the prime
					movers in that disreputable design, which brought New Netherlands into English hands,
					would entitle him to a place, however dishonorable, in its pages.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile, what of his career after his warlike efforts against New Netherland while this
					project was being set on foot? The record of the General Assembly of Connecticut, held at
					Hartford in March, 1664, while Scott was resting from his patriotic exertions, and Nicolls
					was preparing his expedition, tells the story clearly and effectively. Under the
					presidency of John Winthrop, the court ordered that the letter, with "the warrant and
					instructions to the marshal, that have been read in this court," be attended to. That
					warrant is an illuminating document. It is to the effect that "John Scott, inhabitant in
					the liberties of Ashford, alias Setawkit, on Long Island, stands charged in the court at
					Connecticut for sundry heinous crimes, to wit, for speaking words tending to the
					defamation of the King, for seditious practices and tumultuous carriages in several
					plantations, for abetting and encouraging the natives in hostile practices towards each
					other; for usurping the authority of the King in tending to pardon treason; for
					threatening His Majesty's subjects with hanging and banishment; for gross and notorious
					prophanation of God's holy day; for forgery and violation of his solemn oath; for acting
					treacherously toward Connecticut colony; for usurping authority on pretence of a
					commission; for calumniating a commission officer in this corporation; together with a
					general charge of villainous and felonious practices." Even from the briefest summary of
					this dry and formal legal document it will appear to the most casual reader that Scott had
					somehow not commended himself to <pb id="VAB8204-041" n="28"/> the authorities of
					Connecticut. The officials of New Haven, Milford, Branford, Stratford, the coast towns,
					and presently those of the islands adjacent, were ordered to deliver him to the marshal,
					Jonathan Gilbert, to be taken to Hartford for trial. His property was sequestered and
					commissioners ordered to invoice it and keep it from embezzlement; and Scott himself was
					presently arrested and carried to Hartford for trial.</p>
				<p>All this seems a curious return for his military services in behalf of the English
					government; and, on its face; a great injustice. Yet the explanation is comparatively
					simple. It lies in the peculiar situation of colonial affairs in this transition period.
					On his return from England, bearing the Council's instructions in regard to the Navigation
					Acts, he had been received with favor, especially by the New Haven authorities, and he
					had, it may be remembered, been appointed a magistrate on Long Island by the Connecticut
					officials of Hartford. It was the earnest desire of the latter to bring Long Island under
					their jurisdiction now that its eastern part had been liberated from the Dutch by the
					Treaty of Hartford. But on that proposition the Long Islanders were divided. The Baptists,
					Quakers and Mennonites who had found refuge there from New England persecution dreaded
					Puritan government; even many who favored annexation to relieve them from the fear of the
					Dutch declared they had received little but "if so-be's and doubtings" from Connecticut.
					In this situation they had welcomed, if they had not invited, Scott to help them; with
					what result we have seen. For the opportunity had appeared too good to him to be lost; and
					he had promptly taken advantage of his momentary ascendancy to attempt to free Long Island
					from the dominance of Connecticut and make it a more or less independent province under
					his own presidency. It was not very surprising that its <pb id="VAB8204-042" n="29"/>
					inhabitants were inclined to follow the lead thus given, for independence was a very dear
					thing to them; but it is equally natural that the Connecticut authorities were infuriated
					by his ambitions.</p>
				<p>But--possibly in view of their connection with the Atherton Company--Winthrop and his
					associates considered the question of sufficient importance to summon a council of the
					four New England colonies, among other reasons because they feared, from Scott's
					assertions, that he was possessed of some secret authority from the English crown for his
					actions, which might make proceedings against him inadvisable if not positively dangerous.
					Accordingly they wrote to the officials of the other colonies, especially to Major-General
					Leverett of Boston, Scott's old correspondent, inviting them to a conference, Scott's
					trial meanwhile being set for May 8th. The invitation was promptly accepted. Massachusetts
					sent down Leverett and Captain Davis; Plymouth sent William Bradford and Thomas
					Southworth, and these, with other representatives, held deep speech on the case. Scott was
					not without friends. A hundred and forty-four inhabitants of Flushing petitioned for his
					release; the New Haven delegates favored him; and the Massachusetts and Plymouth delegates
					inclined to his cause. But Winthrop and his followers were firm. Scott was not released,
					his trial was duly held, he was convicted, and sentenced to pay a fine of £250, to be
					imprisoned at the pleasure of the court, and to give bond in the sum of £500 for his
					future good behavior. At first Scott blustered and threatened his accusers with charges of
					treason, relying apparently on his connection with Chiffinch and Williamson and whatever
					understandings he may have had with those who promoted the seizure of New York; but he
					ended by humble submission, repentance, and the retraction of the charges <pb
						id="VAB8204-043" n="30"/> he had made against one person in Connecticut, probably the
					governor. Winthrop was not slow in following up his advantage. First the secretary and
					then the governor himself visited Long Island, conferred with the delegates of the English
					towns there; placed them under the authority of Connecticut; took steps to acquire the
					land between Westchester and the Hudson; met Stuyvesant, who urged the Dutch title, which
					Winthrop incontinently rejected, claiming all for England; replaced all the officials
					appointed by Scott with his own nominees, and so returned triumphantly to Hartford.</p>

				<p>Scott's cause was now wholly lost; and before Winthrop had returned he broke jail and
					escaped, taking refuge with his friends on Long Island. Winthrop and his Hartford party
					had won. But their triumph was of few days and full of trouble. On the 26th of August the
					first vessel of Nicolls' squadron anchored in Gravesend Bay. It was soon joined by others,
					bearing the levies from the New England colonies, as well as English troops. The
					Connecticut contingent appeared under the command of Winthrop. The Long Islanders gathered
					in force, conspicuous among them Colonel John Scott at the head of his company. Winthrop
					with his followers brought from Nicolls a demand for surrender; and on September 8th,
					hopeless of defending the town in the face of threatened bombardment, Stuyvesant ratified
					the articles of surrender, which had been drawn up by commissioners appointed from each
					side, and New Amsterdam passed under the authority of the English crown. For Connecticut
					it was a barren victory. Four days earlier, Nicolls had made public the Duke of York's
					patent, and Winthrop had resigned on behalf of Connecticut her claim to Long Island; and
					with that the disputed province came finally under the authority neither of Scott <pb
						id="VAB8204-044" n="31"/>OF LONG ISLAND nor Winthrop, who had striven for it so
					strenuously, but of the Duke of York, who never saw it.</p>
				<p>To this historic event there are two corollaries relating to Scott. The first is a pass
					from Nicolls three days after the surrender, empowering him to return to his house at
					Ashford, without hindrance from the Connecticut authorities; and this, at least, he gained
					by his share in the surrender. The second is a bill from his jailer in Hartford for "12
					weeks' dyat and other expenses," Mr. John Scott, as the petition relates, having escaped.
					There is a certain grim humor in the court's reply. It grants to the said Dan'l Garrad
					(Garret) the sum of £10 out of Mr. John Scott's estate, "if he can come at it." That, as
					one might surmise, did not prove possible, and two years later it was added to the general
					levy on the county and so presumably ultimately paid by those in whose behalf as well as
					his own the Colonel had striven so valiantly.</p>
				<p>The controversy thus determined on the principle of entire injustice to all parties
					concerned, Scott appears to have taken up his old life and practices, little altered by
					the passage of years and the changed circumstances in which he found himself. Again, as a
					decade earlier, he is reported as buying and selling land, and again his name appears in
					records of lawsuits on Long Island. One man he sues for £100 for slander, the fault is
					acknowledged and Scott forgives him. Another he sues for trespass, and with another he
					divides land bought from a third. The "Sunk squa Quashawam" desires and empowers her
					"ancient and great friend John Scott" to sue for all lands bought and paid for on Long
					Island by the English and the Dutch, to receive satisfaction for them and to sell all
					lands not already sold. There is a dispute over the Quaquantanock lands, in the course of
					which Scott was appointed to go to Hartford to clear up the town's title <pb
						id="VAB8204-045" n="32"/> with respect to the Earl of Stirling's claims; while Southold
					and Southampton unite to sue Scott for costs and damage incurred in connection with land
					titles.</p>
				<p>And again he is accused of fomenting disturbances according to his wonted course among
					the people of Setawket. Against him the governor and council of Connecticut protest to
					Nicolls that Setawket men say their plantation will be destroyed if the claims of
					ownership advanced by him on the ground of purchase from the Indians are allowed; and,
					still further, if the principle of engrossing land from the Indians for private uses is
					permitted, it will ruin the whole townships. Therefore they pray for an order that no land
					be bought from the Indians without consent of the General Court. And from this two things
					appear which throw a light upon the times and the position of Scott. He thought he was
					merely endeavoring to secure his share of this world's goods; and perhaps no one would
					have been more surprised to learn that he was rather a type than an individual, the
					representative of a principle rather than a mere adventurer in land.</p>
				<p>For, in the first place, Scott did not belong to that inner circle, which, in the
					language of the time, were "those who managed." The underlying spirit of his age was
					monopoly. Men formed corporations and associations and secured their position by royal
					patent, which effectually barred all competition within their chosen field, whether Indian
					trade or American lands. Perhaps in each case there was reason in this, but it
					unquestionably roused bitter opposition among the outsiders. The records of the East India
					companies are full of complaints against those "interlopers," as they were called, who
					ventured to infringe the monopoly of the licensed company. The annals of the colonies are
					no less full of complaints against those who, like Scott, acted on the principle of a fair
					field and no <pb id="VAB8204-046" n="33"/> favors, of individual enterprise as against
					chartered privilege. It was his misfortune, throughout his whole career, to find himself
					in opposition to those on whom the crown-- perhaps, in their view, Providence itself--had
					conferred that monopoly against whose restrictions his best efforts beat in vain.</p>
				<p>Had he been a different sort of man, it would be impossible not to feel a considerable
					sympathy with him in his endeavors to break through that charmed circle and establish his
					own fortunes by virtue of his undoubted abilities. But the trouble is in his case, as in
					so many others of like sort, that his character deprives us of that sympathy which we
					might otherwise feel. The martyr is so often inferior to the oppressor in the qualities
					which make him endurable to society in general; and it is his misfortune, if it is not his
					fault, that he destroys by his own actions that hope of common support on which rests
					whatever hope of success he may possess. It is not possible to feel the same admiration
					for the Massachusetts authorities or even for Winthrop which historians like Bancroft
					voice in such fulsome words; for it is now no crime to believe that not all of the early
					settlers of America were immaculate or infallible. Yet however we may sympathize with the
					principle for which Scott stood, it is difficult to condone the private character of the
					man, even though it was no worse than that of the more eminently placed rascals who
					managed to cheat him out of his inheritance and cast him aside as a broken tool.</p>
				<p>Still more, it seems probable that the colonial authorities, with all their
					shrewdness--to give it the mildest name-- in defending their monopoly were, on the whole,
					right. The Indians with whom the colonists dealt had no notion of property or titles; they
					sold the same land over and over again, as often as they found a new purchaser. The <pb
						id="VAB8204-047" n="34"/> ensuing complications where this took place may be read in
					every page of colonial history; and had free competition been allowed it would have made
					an end of all security, and perhaps in many instances of the settlements themselves. For
					to unscrupulous operators in land titles this situation has offered at all times an
					opportunity of which they have never been slow to avail themselves. And of these, as well
					as of the class opposed to monopoly, Scott seems to have been an eminent
					representative.</p>
				<p>How he managed it is apparent from another order of the court, this time in New York. In
					February, 1665, he was ordered to bring in, at the General Court of the Assizes following,
					a certain deed or writing "called by the said Captain Scott a Perpetuity, with the King's
					picture on it and a great yellow wax seal affix't to it which he very frequently showed to
					divers persons, and deceived many therewith." At the same time that the authorities of New
					York took this step, their colleagues in Connecticut were deliberating whether Scott's
					fine would reimburse the colony for the damage he had done, and were considering what
					further steps should be taken in the matter. In addition, he was charged with having
					stolen the instructions to Massachusetts and Mr. Maverick's petition from Lord Arlington's
					office. These actions evidently gave the Colonel matter for serious reflection, and when
					October came, with an order from the New York governor for him to appear before the
					General Court of Assizes and produce the letters patent which he claimed to possess, show
					his authority for the Long Island lands then in dispute, and, finally, to account for his
					other offenses, together with a warrant for his arrest, it seemed that the time for his
					departure had arrived. In point of fact, he had already gone. He gave the sheriff the
					slip, took ship for Barbadoes, and palmed himself off on Col. Morris--notable for his
					later removal <pb id="VAB8204-048" n="35"/> to New York, where he settled in that district
					known as Morrisania--as a Quaker escaping from persecution in the New England colonies! He
					was received, apparently with open arms, and so, like a skilful commander, made good his
					retreat to a new position. Thus ended his career in America, where, as elsewhere, he was
					"a bird of prey and passage."</p>
				<p>But before he went he made his mark on history, and incidentally avenged himself on the
					courtiers whom he considered had cheated him out of his rightful inheritance, especially
					the Duke of York. Though his plan could not possibly have brought him any reward, and thus
					bears little relation to his career as he or we conceive it, it is noteworthy not only for
					its ingenuity and efficacy but for the extraordinary results it produced on the geography,
					and even on the history of the United States. For it seems that to him more than to any
					other man is due the peculiar and unfortunate circumstance that New York does not control
					both shores of the harbor on which it lies. The circumstance finds its first expression in
					the Duke's division of the lands granted him by the King, his brother. In June, 1664,
					before that grant was confirmed, and while Nicolls' expedition was on its way to America,
					the Duke of York conveyed to his followers, Sir John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret,
					members of the Committee on Plantations, by whose advice New Netherland was seized, a
					territory bounded on the north by a line running northwest from the Hudson River at about
					the location of Yonkers, and on the west and south by the Delaware River; in short, the
					district known as New Caesarea or New Jersey. The new proprietors promptly drew up a
					constitution modeled on that of Carolina, and sent out a governor, Philip Carteret, a
					relative of Sir George, who arrived in the fall of that year.</p>


				<pb id="VAB8204-049" n="36"/>
				<p>Such was the news which greeted Nicolls at the moment he found himself in possession of
					New Netherland as governor of the new province. As a faithful servant of the Duke, he was
					furious; and apparently in November of that year he wrote a scathing letter to his master.
					He had, he said, seen the grant which the Duke had made to Berkeley and Carteret for all
					lands west of the Hudson River; and he cannot suppose that either the grantor or the
					grantees could possibly have known how prejudicial it was to the Duke's interest or that
					of New York. He must, he went on, "charge it upon Captain Scott, who was born to work
					mischief as far as he is credited or his parts serve him. This Scott (it seems) aimed at
					the same patent which your Royal Highness hath, and hath since given words out that he had
					injury done him by your Royal Highness, whereupon he contrived and betrayed my Lord
					Berkeley and Sir G. Carteret into a design (contrary to their knowledge) of ruining all
					the hopes of increase in this your Royal Highness his territory, which he hath fully
					completed unless your Royal Highness take farther steps herein."</p>
				<p>Such was the last account against Scott in the North American colonies. One of a little
					previous date may be added to make the story complete. A month before Nicolls wrote thus
					to James, he had written to Morrice, then Secretary of State, that Mr. Maverick's petition
					was "stolen from Lord Arlington's office by Captain Scott and delivered to the governor
					and council of Boston--tho' Scott said Williamson had given it to him." This same Scott,
					he went on to say, "by a pretended seal affixed to a writing in which was the King's
					picture drawn with pen and ink or black lead with His Majesty's hand C. R. and subsigned
					Henry Bennet" had abused His Majesty's honor in these parts and had fled to Barbados. But
					Lord <pb id="VAB8204-050" n="36"/> Willoughby, then governor of that island, had sent word
					he would arrest Scott and send him prisoner to England.</p>
				<p>This would certainly have seemed enough to settle the case of Scott. Pursued by three
					colonial governors, driven from his home by enough counts to keep him in prison the
					greater part of his life, and subject to enough fines to ruin what estate he had left, the
					fugitive would seem to have had small chance for any further activities in the British
					empire at least. Moreover, the Gotherson matter had come up to plague him again. For,
					before he fled to Barbados, Dorothea Gotherson had petitioned the King for an order to
					Francis Lovelace, deputy-governor of Long Island, to consider whether she had any claim to
					land bought there for her son; that her husband had paid John Scott £2,000 and had thereby
					died in debt, his lands had been taken, and though she had brought him an estate of £500 a
					year she was obliged to work for bread for herself and her six children. Scott had gone
					before this matter could be attended to, but it remained, as it proved, to vex and finally
					to wreck his fortunes in another land. Meanwhile, Governor Nicolls issued a special
					warrant to the high sheriff to seize all lands, goods, or chattels "which Captain Scott
					hath any right or pretense to within this government."</p>
				<p>This was not the end of the matter, even in the colonies. Mrs. Gotherson was a persistent
					as well as a greatly wronged woman. A year or two later it appeared she agreed with one
					Thomas Lovelace, kinsman of the deputy, that if he could make any money by the sale of her
					land in Kent which her husband had mortgaged, she would bring a hundred and twenty
					families into Long Island "to ye g't advantage of ye place." Accordingly, when Governor
					Lovelace went to New York to succeed Nicolls in 1668, he appointed a commission, of which
					Thomas was a member, <pb id="VAB8204-051" n="38"/> with "Captain Morris of Barbados," to
					enquire. But they could find nothing. The houses which Scott had built for Gotherson had
					been taken down and moved to Setauket, and given to Mrs. Scott by Governor Nicolls for her
					support after her husband had deserted her. One thing, however, the commission did
					find--Gotherson's son, who had been sold into service by Scott to an inn-keeper in New
					Haven. That individual was willing to release him from his duties as stable-boy for the
					sum of £7; and with that, presumably, Mrs. Gotherson had to content herself for the time.
					And with that, too, as the learned gentleman who wrote an account of Scott's life many
					years ago for the Massachusetts Historical Society declares, Scott disappears from
					history. Not quite--for Scott had found the refuge which he sought in the West Indies.
					There Lord Willoughby, it appears, intended, in pursuance of Nicolls' request, to catch
					him and send him prisoner to England. But again Scott seems to have exercised his
					undoubted charm, drawn upon his credit with Williamson, and emerged presently reinstated,
					and, in so far as possible, rehabilitated; for by the middle of the year 1665 we find him
					with a commission in Sir Tobias Bridge's regiment stationed there.</p>
				<p>It was a fertile field for his talents, for there was much doing in that quarter of the
					world which might well serve as an opportunity to reinstate himself. England was then at
					war with Holland and France; and Barbados, where Bridge's regiment was stationed, was a
					storm-center of affairs. Scott landed there in April. In June he, with Colonel Stapleton,
					commanded the reserve in an attack upon the French stronghold of St. Kitts, concerning
					which he wrote a full account, in accordance with Willoughby's letter to Williamson that
					the latter's friend Scott "had escaped" and would inform him of the flight. Scott was <pb
						id="VAB8204-052" n="39"/> not content with describing his own prowess. He took occasion
					to condemn his brothers in arms, and contrasted their conduct with his own,--he, according
					to this account, having been wounded in the arm, breast and shoulder, and inflicted a loss
					of twenty wounded on the crews of the four boats that tried to take him. Accordingly we
					find him a little later petitioning for rewards. That petition is illuminating. It recites
					that in 1665 and 1666 he was in command of a small fleet and a regiment of foot on an
					expedition against the Dutch of Tobago and at New Zealand, Dissekeeb or "Desse Cuba" and
					"Trinberan" in Guiana. At the latter place, by the help of the Caribbees, he burnt and
					destroyed towns, forts, goods, etc., worth £16O,000, and spent for His Majesty's service
					73,788 pounds of sugar. He therefore asks a reward, which, on the basis of this and
					another petition in which he values his expenditures at £1,620, and includes the loss of a
					ketch valued at £500, he requests £738 at 4½ per cent be charged on the Barbados
					excise.</p>
				<p>Besides these we have another and even more detailed account from his pen of the war, and
					especially of the part he took in it. According to that veracious chronicle, he declares
					that in the month of October, 1665, he "having been commissionated Commander-in-chief of a
					small fleet and a regiment of soldiers, for the attack of the Island Tobago, and several
					other settlements in the hands of the Netherlanders in Guiana, as Morocca, Wacopow,
					Bowromome and Dissekeeb, and having touched at Tobago, in less than six months had the
					good fortune to be in possession of those countries, and left them garrisoned for his
					majesty of Great Britain, and sailed thence for Barbados, where meeting with the news of
					the eruption of war between the two crowns of England and France, endeavoured to persuade
					Francis Lord Willoughby to reduce those <pb id="VAB8204-053" n="40"/> several small
					garrisons into one stronghold, and offered that was the way to make good our post in those
					parts, having to do with two potent enemies, but his Lordship, that was his majesty's
					captain-general in those parts, was of another opinion, and embarked on the unfortunate
					voyage for the reducing of St. Christopher, etc.," in which design he perished by a
					hurricane.</p>
				<p>Besides these, still, we have another and what appears to be a wholly independent
					narrative of the same events, under the signature of a certain Captain Byam, who adds this
					eulogy at the beginning of his story: "In November 1665 there arrived from his Exc<hi
						rend="super">llce</hi> (Lord Willoughby) his Serj<hi rend="super">t</hi> Maj<hi
						rend="super">r</hi> Jn<hi rend="super">o</hi> Scott after his victory at Tobago w<hi
						rend="super">th</hi> a smal Fleet and a regiment of Foote under the Carrecter of
					Major-General of Guiana, Chiefe Commissioner and Commander-in-Chiefe by Land and Sea in a
					few months his great Fortune and gallantry prudent and Industrious Conduct made him master
					of all the great province new Zealand &amp; Desseceub settled a peace with the Arrowayes
					left both Collonys in a Flourishing Condition and well garrison'd for the King of
					England," etc.</p>
				<p>Nothing could be clearer than such a story, supported by the testimony of two witnesses,
					one of whom was the hero in question. All the story is partly true. Perhaps it is all
					true; and perhaps we should not lay too much stress on the fact that the second, though
					written ostensibly by Captain Byam, is only known to us through what purports to be a
					copy--and this copy is in Scott's own hand! The story, such as it is, has been accepted by
					historical scholars of the highest consequence; and in view of this circumstance, two
					other pieces of evidence in the case are not without interest. The first is a
					communication from Sir Thomas Bridge which relates that "Major Scott sent to the governor
					of St. Kitts with a letter and money for <pb id="VAB8204-054" n="41"/> the English
					officers there and to get an understanding of the French strength returned with little
					satisfaction and many complaints. The English officers complained of his imprudent
					carriage in the message and ill deportment in the engagement."</p>
				<p>The second is the record of a court-martial held at Nevis by Lord Willoughby's command on
					January 4, 1667, before Sir Thomas Bridge, Lieut.-Col. Stapleton, Major Androsse and
					seventeen others, on a charge against "Capt. John Scott, late colonel of Sir Tobias
					Bridge's regiment of foot." Its findings begin with the observation that "the said Scott
					is generally knowne to bee a notorious coward, and wherever hee has been employ'd in His
					Majesty's service has brought great dishonour upon our King and Country." From that
					premise it goes on to the specific charges that in the attempt on the mainland fort of
					Morocca "he absented himself at the instant time of stormeing the said Fort"; that when
					the fort was taken and the men were on the way back to the ships, he acted very badly in
					the face of the enemy; that when the expedition came to Barohmah Fort, as soon as it was
					within gunshot he "sculked away alone in a Boat," until the place offered to surrender.
					Thirdly, that at St. Christopher's, where he commanded a foot company, he "left his men
					and sculked under a rock," ran away and stripped himself and swam out to the ship,
					pretending he was wounded. Fourthly, to vindicate himself to the Lieutenant-General, he
					aspersed several officers, especially Captain John Cotter. And finally that for his
					dishonorable actions on the mainland and at St. Christopher's, he had been frequently
					"basted and cudgelled by soldiers under his command at Barbados." All this and more is
					sworn to and corroborated by various witnesses cited before the court, some twelve in
					number, and by the examination of several officers who <pb id="VAB8204-055" n="42"/> were
					not present at the sitting, and on these grounds Scott was unanimously found guilty.
					Moreover, Captain Cotter was given leave to go to England and exonerated from all of
					Scott's charges by Lord William Willoughby, who had succeeded Francis.</p>
				<p>It seems therefore at least possible that Scott was not the hero that he, and his friend
					Byam, through the medium of Scott's pen, painted him, during the entire war, however he
					may have distinguished himself on occasion. And to this again there is somewhat to be
					added. Later in the same year Willoughby sent a letter to Williamson by Scott declaring
					that the latter "had done his duty well since Portsmouth," and later still, in January,
					1668, he writes Williamson again that he will come home and give as good an account of the
					Indies as Major Scott, who he hopes has arrived, and if so has probably told Williamson
					"some truth but not all gospel." Which observation reveals in some sort that Willoughby
					had not the greatest confidence in his late lieutenant's veracity. And that is confirmed
					by the governor's pass to Cotter, which included the somewhat irrelevant remark that if
					Scott had come to trial before the court-martial "his smooth tongue would not have saved
					him."</p>
				<p>In any event, Scott left the service and arrived in England some time in the latter part
					of 1667. That arrival is in a sense characteristic of his extraordinary quality of
					reaching a particular spot at the moment when circumstances were favorable to his designs.
					It had been so in 1660; it was to be so on at least one other occasion; and it was
					peculiarly true in the present instance. In June the Dutch, who were still at war with
					England, had made their raid into the Medway and the Thames. Partly owing to that exploit
					England and Holland had made peace in July. In August Clarendon, who had been made the
					scapegoat <pb id="VAB8204-056" n="43"/> goat for the miscarriages of the war, had been
					driven from place and fled from England. And at almost the precise moment that Scott
					arrived in England, big with the news and the importance of his heroic exploits in the
					West Indies, and the less romantic but perhaps more accurate information that the Dutch
					and French had been defeated in that part of the world, a new ministry was just being
					inducted into office. That ministry, known as the Cabal, numbered among its members
					Scott's old patron, Bennet, now Earl of Arlington, who, with two of his colleagues,
					Buckingham and Shaftesbury, played so great a part in the determination of Scott's
					fortunes thenceforth. Here, as in his earlier advent at the court of Charles II, was a
					situation made to his hand, and he was not slow to take advantage of it.</p>
				<p>His first experience was, however, unfortunate; for the year 1668 had hardly dawned when
					he was arrested for debt and taken to the Gatehouse prison. He promptly appealed to
					Arlington for relief, and reiterated--with some small additions--his recent eminent
					services to the government. In this petition he raises the sum he spent in behalf of his
					native land to £3,000; asserts that he had re-settled Antigua and Montserrat, made peace
					with the Indians before he had been thirty hours in Barbados, and had sailed to England on
					Lord Willoughby's motion, to give the King an account of affairs in the West Indies.
					Moreover, he had saved the King's ships from a hurricane. He had served a gracious Prince,
					he concludes, yet for £30/10, not yet due, he is in jail without influence on His Majesty
					for release and must go from jail to jail.</p>
				<p>It is a pathetic plea, and Arlington was apparently touched by it, for, through some
					influence, Scott's petition for £100 was allowed, and apparently by July or August he
					actually got the money--and how great a feat that was <pb id="VAB8204-057" n="44"/> at
					this precise period of English finance can only be appreciated by a somewhat intimate
					acquaintance with the circumstances of English administration of the time. He got, indeed,
					much more; for by the end of August a royal warrant, countersigned by Arlington, conferred
					upon him a government appointment, the post of royal geographer! For he had approved
					himself, as Buckingham observed in later years, a very useful rogue.</p>
				<p>And with this we come to another remarkable passage in a remarkable life. For a dozen
					years or more Scott had played some little part in public affairs. Now, inspired by the
					situation in which he found himself, and mindful of his unusual gifts and experiences, he
					aspired not to make but to write history. As soon as he was settled in his new
					post--probably even before--he had begun an attempt to justify his appointment by the
					execution of a great work on the "Coasts and Islands of America." This included, among
					other things, a "Discription of Guiana," which was one day to give him standing in the
					world where even he could scarcely have imagined it.</p>
				<p>What, we may well ask, were the qualifications of such a man to undertake this most
					difficult form of literary composition; what was his training, his purpose, and his hope
					of success in that field? That question was to be asked again on at least one occasion of
					great importance; and, as he has given the answer in his own words, it is proper that they
					should be inserted here. For his methods as he described them were so precisely those of
					Herodotus, the father of history--or, according to his enemies, the father of lies--that
					they may well be quoted in their entirety.</p>
				<p>"In my youth," Scott begins his narrative, "I was a great lover of Geographie and History
					in Generall, but aboute the Eighteenth yeare of my age I tooke up a<pb id="VAB8204-058"
						n="45"/> resolution to make America the scene of the greatest actions of my life, and
					there to sett myselfe a worke (if possible) to finde out the Latitudes, the Longitudes,
					and to know the oridginall discovery with the situations of all places both on the
					Continent and in the Islands; as also the names of Persons and of what Nations they were
					who have possessed them, and what fortune each Nation hath had, and (as neare as I could)
					the fortune of the severall governors successively, and of the respective Collonies, the
					most remarkable distempers and diseases, the Commodityes abounding and advantages of
					trade, what places were more or less Tenable of Nature, and what were made strong by
					fortifications, in what manner, and to what degree; Moreover how these colonies have
					prospered or declined in Trade, increased or decreased in number of Inhabitants from
					Europe, and the proper causes thereof; Together with the strength of the severall Indian
					Nations, their customes, Governments, and Commodities, and what advantages may be made of
					them in point of Warr or by Trade. I labour'd likewise to discover the Rocks, Sandes
					Shelves, and Soundings about every Island, and in the Entrance of all Ports, Havens,
					Rivers, and Creeks, as well on the Terra firma as the Islands, my scope at first being
					only for my owne particular sattisfaction, but now I am not out of hope these things may
					be both of some reputacion to myselfe, and a generall advantage to the English Nation, by
					which especially I shall have my end and reckon these eighteene yeares past, by running
					through all manner of dangers (at seve'll times) to make Collections and Observations,
					have been spent to good purpose for my Country, and thereby put mee in possession of the
					greatest fellicity that can befall a man in this life."</p>
				<p>"I had once a purpose," he continues, "to have given you a large discription of all
					America," but considering <pb id="VAB8204-059" n="46"/> the Spanish Indies had been fully
					treated, he decided to confine his book to "new accounts from observations of my owne (or
					such living Testimonies as I could credit) Touching those places which have not been
					sufficiently sett forth by any man before me; Purposely omitting that part of the Spanish
					Indies that I have noe knowledge of ... I chose rather to content myselfe with what (in
					great part) I know, what my owne eyes have seen, and much of what my feet have trodden,
					and my sences brought under an exact inquiry, confineing my selfe with the River amazon on

				<p>Concerning this simple and modest narrative of the historian-errant, there is perhaps
					only one observation necessary. It is that, taken in connection with the extremely active
					life which Scott led during those same years in which he was engaged upon his historical
					labors, one ,can only marvel at his extraordinary industry and concentration and his
					application to such scholarly ideals when his mind must have often been so busy with other
					matters than the pursuit of ultimate truth.</p>
				<p>Perhaps in this connection, if it is not too wearisome, it may be interesting to compare
					with this, and with the narrative of his life up to this point, the preface which he
					composed for this great work. Amid the strenuous activities with which his earlier and
					later years were filled it may be worth a quiet hour to stop, as he did, and contemplate
					the eternities and immensities.</p>
				<p>"Deare Countrymen," he begins: "Forasmuch as man is not borne for himselfe, or to confine
					his Aimes within the narrow compass of his owne poor pleasures or advantages, but being a
					creature of celestiall extract ought ever to be looking upwards from whence he came,
					Proposing to <pb id="VAB8204-061" n="48"/> himselfe an imitation of God, that universall
					goodness after whose image he is made, and after that Glory and greatness in some measure,
					which is absolutely and infinitely inherent only in him, but displayed throughout the
					frame of this wonderfull Globe of Heaven and Earth (which glory consists in the Ample
					manifestation of that goodness by acts of benevolence towards the whole race of mankinde,
					doing good through all generations, teaching us thereby what we ought to doe for one
					another) Therefore Pardon mee (Sirs) if I who, knowing the circumstances of my owne Life
					have reason enough to consider that having been bred much in warrs, &amp; the world might
					judge those imployments might neither give mee time, nor inclinations for such a worke do
					yet nevertheless presume to tell you that I would faine be an humble follower of that
					great Example of publick good. because we are all commanded to follow it and be like him,"
					he has, in brief, begun this book "because it comes attended with all the affections &amp;
					dutyes which I owe unto our Native Country." As to the subject matter, he continues,
					"Peradventure the like may not be seene again, if I perish before the Publication; and
					this is said (I assure you) not in vanity of mind to prize myselfe above others, but
					rather to magnifie God's goodness to me who hath by carrying me through innumerable
					labours and hazards, in various imployments, given me such opportunities as have not been
					afforded to many in times past &amp; will rarely befall any one man hereafter, in that
					part of the world which I intend to discribe."</p>
				<p>This, among its other revelations, shows that Scott's connection with Southwick and the
					Gothersons was, after all, not wholly without its effect upon at least his literary style.
					One part of this entertaining preface is unquestionably true, the like of Scott's
					narrative, even so far as it went, has not <pb id="VAB8204-062" n="49"/> been seen again.
					It is a loss to literature that he was not permitted to complete this great work and that
					only a part of what he did write has seen the light of print; and when one considers under
					what auspices his efforts did finally appear, it goes far to justify his assertions and to
					increase the regret at its incompleteness. But if it is unfortunate that he never
					completed this work, it is perhaps a still greater loss to posterity that he was able to
					enjoy his new dignity so short a time. Three days before Scott was commissioned royal
					geographer, Col. Richard Nicolls, having been superseded as governor of New York by Col.
					Francis Lovelace, sailed for England, where he arrived in the latter part of the year
					1668. Within six months we find, whether in consequence of his arrival or of other
					circumstances, two pieces of evidence material to the case of Scott. The first is a series
					of communications from Dorothea Gotherson to Governor Lovelace and his brother Thomas
					reciting the fact that she had appealed to the King to right her wrongs; that Charles had
					taken pity on her; and that steps had been taken through the Council to communicate with
					Lovelace, with what result we have already seen, in the discovery of her son and the
					attempt to recover some of the property lost through Scott.</p>
				<p>The second is an intimation that on Nicolls' arrival in England he informed the king of
					Scott's career in America, and that upon this Scott "vanished from Whitehall." That he did
					vanish appears from another note from Mrs. Gotherson indicating that she had received
					letters from him, and expressing the hope that he would return from Holland, whither, it
					appears, he had gone. To this may be added a communication from Scott to Williamson
					disavowing all connection with a certain Andrews whom Scott had recommended and who had
					committed some unnamed villainy, with the result that, joined to these other <pb
						id="VAB8204-063" n="50"/> circumstances, Scott completely lost Williamson's favor and
					with it his principal claim to recognition and respectability. It is perhaps small wonder
					that this is accompanied by "a scrap of paper," requesting "prayer for a troubled, sinful,
					and almost despairing soul." He did not return from Holland for reasons known to himself
					and to the English government, and probably not wholly unsuspected even by Mrs.
					Gotherson.</p>
				<p>What those reasons were, and in what activities and society he busied himself is shown,
					among other testimony, by the deposition of a certain John Abbot, an English resident of
					Haarlem. He declared, in later years, that between 1669 and 1672 he had often had at his
					house "one John Scot, commonly called Major General Scot," who went in company with "an
					ancient gentleman, Coll. Wogan," William Cole, Dr. Richardson, and a Mr. Ray, alias John
					Phelps. He deposed further, that Scott had maps and charts of the West Indies, that he was
					a man evilly spoken of, and that in spite of the fact that he held a commission in the
					Dutch army, he had on at least one occasion been soundly beaten by Abbot's servant. Taking
					all these things into account, there can be little doubt that this was the royal
					geographer.</p>
				<p>But who were these new associates, and what was he doing in Holland? The answer is not
					wholly clear, but there is evidence enough to enable one to arrive at an approximation to
					the truth. Wogan and Phelps had been members of the high court of justice which had
					condemned Charles I to death. Dr. Richardson was one of the most active movers in the
					Nonconformist plot which had led to a rising in the northern counties of England in 1663.
					All were proclaimed outlaws and traitors. Their chief business was the fomenting of
					disturbance against the government of Charles II; their chief hope was to overthrow <pb
						id="VAB8204-064" n="51"/> that government; their chief means of support lay in certain
					contributions taken up among the faithful in England under guise of sending aid to the
					Waldensians, the persecuted Vaudois, or the "Poles"; and there is evidence that Scott
					benefitted by this "Polish fund." These men were, in short, the center of a widespread
					intrigue, which had for its purpose the creation of trouble for the English authorities by
					whatever means that could be accomplished.</p>
				<p>They had many friends and correspondents throughout the world, and with Scott's entry
					into this circle he came in touch with the underground politics which played such a part
					in the reign of Charles II, and was thenceforth to condition the late royal geographer's
					career to the end of his life. In this the old Cromwellians had their full share. Upon the
					Restoration, their party had been broken up. Some leaders, like Vane and Harrison, had
					been seized and executed. Some, like General Lambert, whose popularity prevented the
					government from bringing them to the block, were doomed to life imprisonment. Some, like
					Goffe, Whalley, Dixwell and Bourne, found refuge in America. Some, like Ludlow, Sidney,
					and Lisle, fled to Switzerland. A few took service in continental armies. Others, like
					those with whom Scott now consorted in this "Adventure of the Regicides," remained in the
					Netherlands. There they were in close touch with the Dutch government on the one side, and
					on the other with the discontented Nonconformist element in England that had been driven
					first from the church then from politics by the so-called Persecuting Acts of the Anglican
					party during the Clarendon administration, which had thus endeavored to crush
					Nonconformity once and for all. They were a distinct menace to the English government,
					which could take no step without reckoning the possible danger from these men <pb
						id="VAB8204-065" n="52"/> and the aid which they might bring to the enemies of England.
					Many of them had actually taken part in the recent Anglo-Dutch war. At least one
					Cromwellian officer had commanded troops on English soil against his countrymen, in an
					effort to take Harwich fort; while in the famous raid up the Medway and the Thames the
					Dutch fleet had been partly manned, and probably largely piloted, by English sailors in
					Dutch service.</p>
				<p>It was therefore natural enough that a fugitive like Scott should seek and find refuge
					and a welcome among this group. It was no less natural that he should acquire a commission
					in the Dutch service; and it was perhaps most natural of all that he should seek to turn
					his gifts and knowledge to the account of his own advantage in this environment. One need
					not accept Mrs. Gotherson's theory that he used the information which had come in his way
					as commander in the West Indies and as royal geographer to further his fortunes with the
					Dutch authorities; but there was good ground for that hypothesis and it is not easy to
					believe that he found these any handicap in his new venture.</p>
				<p>At any rate, it seems certain that he commanded at least a company in the Dutch army,
					though it is not probable that he derived his title of Major-General from that
					circumstance. It is equally certain that he was implicated with a man named Despontyn in
					various dubious financial transactions relating to that company's pay. He entered into a
					plan to defraud a Jew of a considerable sum; he cheated his landlady. It is not necessary
					to accept the story that he defrauded the States of Holland out of £7,000 or £8,000, and
					that he was driven from the country and hanged in effigy there in consequence; but
					probably only the amount and the disgrace were exaggerated; the main fact seems clear.
					There is, moreover, evidence to show <pb id="VAB8204-066" n="53"/> that he provided his
					new employers with maps, soundings and plans of the defenses of English harbors, and
					information of English naval strengths and designs, and in so far Mrs. Gotherson's
					surmises were justified. And there is only too much evidence that this same Scott,
					"shield-bearer and geographer-royal," as he styled himself, was, during his stay in
					Holland, at once dishonest and dissolute in a large variety of ways not necessary to
					enumerate here.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile English affairs, during the period of Scott's sojourn in Holland, took a fresh
					turn in that devious course which they pursued throughout the Restoration period, and in
					so doing unconsciously helped Scott in determining his own course, in whose direction he
					was ably assisted by the authorities of the countries in which he successively sought
					refuge and a livelihood. His stay in Holland coincided almost exactly with the period
					during which the Cabal remained in power. That period bears a peculiar reputation in
					English history, and one not wholly favorable to its policy or its members. This is not
					surprising, whether we consider the character of some of its members, the policies which
					they pursued in their collective capacity, and, in particular, the fact that their history
					has been written chiefly by their enemies, the Anglicans. Whatever religion they professed
					or despised, they were none of them of the latter party, whose overthrow brought them to
					power, and whose revival drove them in turn from place.</p>
				<p>The first act of their administration had been the signature of the Triple Alliance with
					Holland and Sweden to check Louis XIV's aggressions. Yet they bore no love for the Dutch,
					who were the chief rivals of that interest to which the Cabal devoted its best
					talents--the development of English commerce. That feeling was shared, on different
					grounds, perhaps, by their sovereign, who, in 1670, signed the secret Treaty of Dover with
					his cousin, <pb id="VAB8204-067" n="54"/> the French king, in return for a substantial
					pension. Thereafter events moved toward an Anglo-French alliance and a joint attack on
					Holland; and, at about the time that Scott found his position in Holland becoming
					difficult, his government began to take steps to prepare for war with that power. The
					Nonconformists were conciliated in so far as possible, and many of the exiles were
					pardoned and permitted to return. A royal Declaration of Indulgence gave virtual
					toleration to the Dissenters. The stop of the Exchequer provided the government with a sum
					which, added to a Parliamentary grant, enabled the administration to equip the navy; and
					hostilities began by an attempt to seize the Dutch Smyrna fleet. Louis XIV poured his
					armies into the Netherlands and Holland faced one of the most dangerous crises in her
					troubled history.</p>
				<p>And what of Scott in these busy days of broken alliances and international treacheries?
					The evidence is conflicting, as it well might be. Some of it goes to show that he improved
					his stay in Holland to inform his own government of the doings of the exiles, and carried
					on negotiations between them and the English authorities. Some of it seems to suggest that
					the attack on the Smyrna fleet failed owing to a warning sent the Dutch by Scott. That
					there is ground for believing that all of this is more or less true appears from certain
					testimony that he was employed by Arlington to live at Bruges as a spy; that he was seen
					there by other English agents--notably the first English woman novelist, Apra Behn--in the
					exercise of his profession; that he was paid by the English consul there; and that he
					presently lost his employment for having opened negotiations with the Dutch. And there is
					nothing incompatible with his own character or that of the times and class which he
					adorned in the supposition that he took his profit where he found it, and was paid by both
					sides. In <pb id="VAB8204-068" n="55"/> any event, his stay in Bruges seems to have been
					of few days and full of trouble, for, besides his other misfortunes, he was found
					sketching the fortifications of the place, was driven out and compelled to seek refuge in
					Paris. There he arrived, as usual, at the opportune moment; for England and France, allied
					against Holland, found themselves again in accord, and prepared to employ the services of
					one so recently in Dutch service.</p>
				<p>He did not go empty-handed. As in his earlier exodus to and from the court of Charles II,
					he brought to Paris an interesting collection of curiosities. First among them were the
					maps and plans upon which he always relied, and not without much reason, to give him
					standing in a new community. Moreover, he seems to have secured from various persons
					various small sums of money to meet his unavoidable expenses, a "Silver Belt, a
					Fowling-peece or two, two or three copper-plates of Mapps, one great picture, of great
					value as he pretended, and two swords, one whereof (to magnify its value) he pretended to
					have been Cromwell's." Nor was this all, for we find one Sherwin, the inventor of a new
					method of casting ordnance, writing about this time to the Marquis de Seignelay, French
					Minister of Marine, begging him to recover two little cannon, stolen by Scott, whose
					"intrigues have ruined the whole enterprise" of supplying the new guns to the French
					government.</p>
				<p>Thus equipped, he arrived in Paris at a propitious time to dispose of the information he
					possessed, and he found the French capital a fertile field for the exercise of his
					peculiar talents. He was nothing if not impartial, and he was as little bound by any weak
					scruples of patriotism as the most recent of internationalists. His career, indeed, began
					auspiciously, for as he had earlier informed the English of Dutch designs, and more
					recently enlightened <pb id="VAB8204-069" n="56"/>the Dutch regarding the English plans,
					he was now in a position to provide the French with information regarding both the English
					and the Dutch, and in a fair way, if opportunity presented itself, to gain material which
					could be disposed of, in turn, to England, or even to Holland, if circumstances seemed to
					make it necessary or profitable.</p>
				<p>He set up at first apparently as a map-maker and a geographical expert, with what more
					obscure relations with the French government may be surmised. He had, it would seem, no
					great skill himself in cartography, but he was fortunate enough to be able to find a man
					who could draw, and him he supplied with data from his own knowledge, and, on at least one
					recorded occasion, from his imagination. Meanwhile he strove, not without success, to
					ingratiate himself with those in place and power. He dabbled in alchemy, he even seems to
					have dreamed of getting a French ship and turning pirate. He had some obscure connection
					with a certain Mlle. des Moulins, to whom he wrote letters in French, signed "Jean Scot of
					Scot's Hall," and from whom he received various sums for expenses in journeys made on her
					account. And it may be noted here, as perhaps only a peculiar coincidence but possibly a
					matter of not entirely extraneous interest, that a man of that name sometime in Dutch
					service, sometime secretary to the Earl of Arlington, was hanged in England about this
					time on a charge of treason.</p>
				<p>Scott was more fortunate. He seems to have been employed in some capacity by the Prince
					de Condé, under circumstances of such peculiar character that it seemed necessary to the
					French authorities a little later to deny categorically that he had ever been in the
					immediate service of the French government, without, however, committing themselves to the
					indiscretion of alluding to his connection with Condé. Beyond this there are scattered
					notices of <pb id="VAB8204-070" n="57"/> other and less public activities. He seems to
					have stolen a locket from a certain M. Delavall, a hat from one man, a muffler from
					another. He managed to make the acquaintance of a Catholic nobleman, the Earl of
					Berkshire, then resident in Paris--a connection which was presently to be of some service
					in bringing him again into the public eye; and he seems not to have wholly severed his
					relations with the less obtrusive side of English administration, for there is evidence
					that at least during the year 1677 he was at times in London, in close touch with Sir
					Ellis Leighton, chief agent of the Duke of Buckingham, upholding the French interest,
					denouncing William of Orange, and frequenting the purlieus of the court.</p>
				<p>Thus he passed some busy years. Meanwhile the situation in European, and more
					particularly in English politics, altered, and with it came a corresponding change in
					Scott's position and his relationships. While he had thus busied himself England and
					France had made their joint attack on Holland. On the continent the courage of the Dutch
					held the Anglo-French attack at bay, and though the outbreak of war had been accompanied
					by a revolution which cost the Dutch leader, John de Witt, his life, it brought to the
					head of affairs a greater spirit, William III, whose abilities presently drew together an
					alliance against Louis XIV. The support of England became the prize for which the rival
					groups of allies contended. London was filled with their agents, the French striving to
					hold the English to their allegiance, the Dutch, the Imperialists and the Spaniards
					striving to detach them from the French cause. The Cabal was driven from power, and
					succeeded by the Anglican or Court Party under the Earl of Danby. Little by little the
					English people were awakened to the true significance of Louis XIV's designs. The struggle
					was transferred to the House of Commons, which first <pb id="VAB8204-071" n="58"/>
					summoned Arlington and Buckingham before it to account for the miscarriages of the war and
					their part in the illegal proceedings which had preceded it; and then, under the direction
					of the leaders of the Country Party, in which Buckingham and Shaftesbury came to play the
					principal rôles, turned upon the King and the French policy.</p>
				<p>The result was a complete reversal of parts in English and in Continental affairs. The
					English king was compelled to break with France, to make peace with Holland, and to give
					his consent to the marriage of his niece with William of Orange. That astute prince made
					head against his enemy. The Imperialists, having defeated the Turks, were enabled to throw
					their strength against the western front. The English Parliament voted great supplies,
					authorized the raising of an army and pressed forward to war with France on the side of
					the grand alliance now formed against Louis XIV. In the face of these events the Grand
					Monarque was compelled to peace, and in the month of August, 1678, diplomats assembled at
					Nymwegen to negotiate the great treaty which takes its name from that place.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile the situation in England was complicated by the introduction of a religious
					element. From the beginning of the reign of Charles II the Catholics had bestirred
					themselves to recover what they might of the position they once held in the British Isles.
					The king himself was not unfavorable to their cause. His brother, James, Duke of York,
					with many members of the court, openly embraced the ancient faith; and among the results
					of the anti-French agitation the passage of a Test Act drove him, with his
					co-religionists, from civil and military command. The Catholic minority, like the
					Cromwellians before them, resorted to conspiracy against the government of Charles II. The
					king, who had assented to the secret treaty of <pb id="VAB8204-072" n="59"/> Dover, which
					contained a clause looking toward the re-establishment of Catholicism in England, took no
					steps to combat the movement. The people became aroused to the danger, and their alarm was
					fostered by the leaders of the Country Party. The result was an explosion. At almost
					precisely the same moment that the diplomats assembled at Nymwegen one of the most
					extraordinary episodes in English history began its spectacular course, for the King was
					warned that there was a Catholic conspiracy, famous as the so-called Popish Plot, then on
					foot against his person and his crown, as well as against English Protestantism.</p>
				<p>To that warning, drawn up in the form of an elaborate memorandum by two men, Titus Oates
					and Israel Tonge, he paid little heed. But when, two months later, a London justice of the
					peace, Sir Edmundberry Godfrey, before whom Oates had sworn out a copy of his information,
					was found murdered, the London mob, the English people and in particular the Whig party,
					under the able leadership of Shaftesbury and Buckingham, were roused to a frenzy,
					unparalleled in English history. The whole great mystery was thrown at once into politics.
					The Whigs saw in it an opportunity to dispose of their rivals, especially the Duke of
					York, whom they hoped to exclude from the succession to the throne. So far as may be
					judged from this distance, the ambitions of Shaftesbury lay in the direction of
					overthrowing Danby and making the accession of the Duke of York to the throne impossible,
					with whatever dreams he may have had of directing English affairs himself as the head of a
					dominant party in the state. What designs the Duke of Buckingham entertained are still
					more difficult to determine, but it seems not improbable that among them was some wild
					project of becoming, if not king, at least Lord Protector of the realm, to whose crown he
					pretended to possess hereditary claims.</p>


				<pb id="VAB8204-073" n="60"/>

				<p>But this much is certain. Almost if not quite alone of all the characters who have played
					a part in English history the brilliant and erratic Buckingham surrounded himself with a
					group of bravos, which comprised some of the greatest scoundrels left unhung in England.
					There was that Christian who became the model for the villain in Scott's novel of <hi
						rend="i">Peveril of the Peak</hi>. There was Colonel Blood, who had achieved eminence by
					his all but successful attempt to steal the crown and sceptre from the Tower some years
					before. These were fair types of the lower order. Among those of higher rank was Lord
					Howard of Escrick, perhaps the most finished rascal of his time; and, not to call more
					names, there was the Duke's representative in Paris and at times elsewhere, Sir Ellis
					Leighton. For while Shaftesbury relied on his wits, on the famous Green Ribbon Club which
					formed the active principle of the Whig party, and on the "brisk boys" of the London mob,
					the Duke, whether his designs were deeper or his morals more blunted, was not so nice in
					his taste in supporters.</p>
				<p>Another group was perhaps more respectable in its personnel, if not more scrupulous in
					its designs. About the Duke of York had grown up a Catholic cabal among whose membership
					were numbered such names as Lord Bellasis and Lord Powis; Lord Petre; the Duke's
					secretary, Coleman; and a company of lesser agents, among whom a section of the Jesuits
					were the ablest though not the most conspicuous. What their aims were we have already
					suggested, the succession of James to the throne, and the elevation of Catholicism to
					equality if not supremacy in the state.</p>
				<p>In such a golden age of conspiracy nothing could have been more natural, indeed one might
					almost say inevitable, than that Scott should have found some part to his liking, <pb
						id="VAB8204-074" n="61"/> and, what was always to his liking, his interest. Just how he
					came into touch with Buckingham we know, but the means are certainly peculiar. For he
					seems to have been recommended to Leighton about 1676 by Peter and Richard Talbot, Irish
					Catholics then resident on the continent for reasons best known to the English government,
					and with some obscure relation to the Duke of York: Leighton, in turn, brought Scott to
					the attention of Buckingham, who found him, as he said, a very useful rogue. There may be
					some clue to this mysterious connection between Scott, Leighton and the Talbots in the
					fact that Scott had commended himself to the Earl of Berkshire by professing himself,
					according to the testimony of one of the Earl's servants, as belonging to the same
					communion as that of the exiled nobleman, that of the Catholic church.</p>
				<p>At any rate he was soon a member of the company of choice spirits enrolled under the
					banner of Buckingham. In September, 1678, the Duke seems to have visited France,
					incognito. There at Abbeville he met Scott and "such company as ought to be seen in
					disguise," and probably at that time made such plans as were soon revealed in Scott's
					actions. For in November we find Buckingham writing to Louis XIV desiring to be of use to
					that monarch, especially for "the last favor" from the French King's hands. The bearer,
					Mr. Scott, he goes on to say, will tell him orally the message he sends. This was
					accompanied by another letter to M. de Pomponne, in the same tenor and by the same hand.
					All of which, ostensibly, had to do with a plot to assassinate Louis.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile in England the Popish Plot agitation under skilful manipulation had assumed the
					dimensions of a national panic. Oates and Tonge became popular heroes. Every Catholic fell
					under suspicion, and arrests were made <pb id="VAB8204-075" n="62"/> right and left. The
					Earl of Powis, Lord Petre, Lord Bellasis, Viscount Stafford and Lord Arundel of Wardour
					--the principal men named in Oates' information--were taken into custody, and presently
					impeached. Coleman and six other men--almost certainly the wrong ones-- were tried and
					executed as quickly as the machinery of the law could be set in motion. Many more were
					accused and hard put to it to defend themselves. Parliament passed the Test Act excluding
					Catholics from office, Danby was impeached, and by March, 1679, the Duke of York was
					compelled to seek refuge in Brussels.</p>
				<p>Thus began that great episode which so greatly disturbed the course of English politics
					in the years 1678 and 1679 and diverted English attention even from the Peace of Nymwegen,
					which the French King had meanwhile been compelled to sign with his enemies. It need
					hardly be said that the Whigs, under the lead of Shaftesbury and Buckingham, embraced the
					opportunity thus afforded them to press hard their attack upon the Duke of York. Every
					device of political agitation, every means of furthering the Plot was relentlessly used by
					them; every informer encouraged, every "discovery" exploited. In turn, after Oates and
					Tonge, there came other witnesses on the scene, Bedloe, Prance, Dugdale, and others less
					notable, a choice collection of criminals, conspirators and perjurers, to give evidence
					concerning the Plot and the murder of Godfrey, to be rewarded for their services, and, in
					general, to save the country from the evils which threatened it.</p>
				<p>With such matters stirring in the world, this was no time for such a man as Scott to be
					idle; and we find him, in consequence, going back and forth between England and France,
					busily engaged, apparently on Buckingham's errands. Here too we get finally a glimpse of
					what sort <pb id="VAB8204-076" n="63"/> of man he was in his external appearance. On
					October 19, 1678, traveling at Gravesend under the name of Godfrey, he is shown in the
					flesh. "A proper well-sett man in a great light coulered Periwigg, rough-visaged, haveing
					large haire on his Eyebrows, hollow eyde, a little squintain or a cast with his Eye, full
					faced about ye cheekes, about 46 yeares of Age with a Black hatt &amp; in a streight
					boddyed coate cloath colour with silver lace behind." Thus for the moment we have him,
					held by the order of the Admiralty Secretary, Pepys, who did not then apparently know who
					or what he was, save that his actions had led to suspicion.</p>
				<p>By whatever method, he seems to have got safe away, but a month later (November 8, 1678)
					a royal warrant addressed to Col. Strode, the Lieutenant of Dover Castle, directed him to
					seize Scott as soon as he should land at Dover. For his numerous journeys in the preceding
					months in various guises and under various names, usually Godfrey or Johnson, had made him
					suspect to the English government, especially in view of his unbridled tongue. With all
					his gifts, Scott's volubility made him peculiarly unfitted for the rôle of a conspirator.
					He had continually boasted himself a friend of Buckingham, continually acted in "violent
					and overbearing fashion," was often "full of Guinneyes," "without any visible estate to
					support himself with," not seldom drunk, and known to carry with him maps, plans and
					estimates of naval and ordnance matters. Thus, wherever he went he was a marked man, and
					one, under the circumstances, to be watched and, if possible, apprehended. Despite all
					this he was not caught, and it was not until the following spring that he came again into
					public life.</p>
				<p>The circumstances were, like most circumstances in his life, extraordinary. In March,
					1679, the Earl of Berkshire <pb id="VAB8204-077" n="64"/> died in Paris. Some weeks after
					that--to be exact, on April 28 or 29, a fortnight after Danby had been committed to the
					Tower, and at the moment that Parliament had passed a resolution against the Duke of
					York--there arrived at Folkestone a man who called himself John Johnson. On his way to
					London, it seems, he was arrested at Dover and there compelled to give an account of
					himself, which he was, apparently, by no means loath to do. He was, he said, a pensioner
					of the Prince of Condé. He had formerly commanded the Prince's regiment of horse in the
					French service and had surveyed the Prince's land in Picardy and Burgundy. His name was
					Scott, the occasion of his return was to see his native country, his profession that of a
					soldier, his landing at Folkestone only to see the boatman that had transported him in the
					preceding October, "whom he understood to be in great trouble for carrying him over." He
					offered to take the oaths of Supremacy, Allegiance, and the Test.</p>
				<p>This was perhaps the more desirable, inasmuch as it appeared from his testimony that he
					had been most solicitous for news relating to Parliamentary votes of money to raise a
					fleet and an army, and peculiarly inquisitive regarding naval and ordnance estimates. To
					gratify that curiosity, it appeared that a certain Captain Newman finally drew up for him
					in a little book "a collection of the severall estimates from the offices of the navy and
					ordnance," the charges, the members, the rules, the force and the state of the coast
					fortifications, especially of Portsmouth, Plymouth and the Isle of Wight. Whereupon the
					Colonel disappeared for five or six weeks, returning in funds and bringing with him a rich
					wardrobe and some sort of a paper "under the French King's own hand." All this was in due
					time set forth in a deposition by Captain Newman himself, though his testimony was
					apparently not <pb id="VAB8204-078" n="65"/> available until too late to be of much use
					for the purpose for which it was taken.</p>
				<p>Accordingly, Scott was carried to London. There he told a curious story, and produced a
					still more curious document. The Earl of Berkshire, he said, having long been ill, sent
					for him in March to advise about a physician. One was procured, but it was too late, and
					the Earl, having had Scott brought to him, sent the servants away and confided to him that
					there had been "a foolish and an ill design" carried on in England of which he had known
					nothing till Lord Arundel, Mr. Coleman and others had told him it could not miscarry, and
					that he should be "looked on as an ill man if he did not come in in time." He had heard
					nothing about killing the King or he would have revealed it. Lord Bellasis was an "ill
					man"; "he and others were accustomed to speak ill of the king, indeed very irreverently."
					He refused to tell Scott who the others were, made him promise to tell the King, and so
					continued: "My Lord Stafford was all along a moving agent-- though not very malicious ....
					My Lord Powis his covetousness drew him in further than he would have gone. --My Lord
					Peeter . . . was ever averse to all things of intrigue in this matter." And so, Lord
					Cardigan being at the door, he dismissed Scott, urging him not to forget this, "nor the
					business at Rohan." This, with some circumlocution and much elaboration, was the message
					Scott brought to London.</p>
				<p>It is not easy to discover what, if any, benefits or injuries occurred from this curious
					episode to Scott or any one else. The most recent historian of the Popish Plot is himself
					somewhat at a loss to account for it, since, as he observes, Scott "ran counter to the
					testimony of Oates as to the designs against the King's life, he never sought reward as a
					professional informer would have done, he gave <pb id="VAB8204-079" n="66"/> no evidence
					against those condemned for the Plot, and his name does not appear in the secret-service
					lists." He concludes that he must have had some knowledge of Berkshire's correspondence
					with Coleman from the nobleman himself, and that "a scoundrel following in the track of
					Oates and Bedloe would never have concocted such a story"--hence it is "probably genuine."
					Moreover he adds, like the worthy member of the Massachusetts Historical Society who fifty
					years earlier contributed to the biography of Scott, "Nothing more was known of him." This
					he qualifies a little in a foot-note recording that Scott testified before the House of
					Commons later that Pepys had given information to the French court regarding the navy "but
					the affair was never investigated."</p>
				<p>What, then, can be made of this? As it has been observed of an earlier episode, all of it
					is partly true, perhaps part of it is all true. Scott had known the Earl of Berkshire; the
					Earl of Berkshire was a Catholic; he had had some communication with the Catholic party in
					England; he was now dead. That much is certain. Oates' testimony, now fairly well known,
					had implicated Lord Bellasis, Lord Petre, Lord Arundel of Wardour, the Earl of Powis and
					Viscount Stafford. They were, as a matter of fact, then prisoners in the Tower. Coleman
					had been tried and executed for treason, and the five Popish Lords impeached. All of this,
					and much more, was matter of common knowledge. Thus far we are willing to go with the
					chronicler of the Plot, or with Scott, or with any man who had read or heard of the events
					of those busy days between August, 1678, and April, 1679--and there must have been very
					few men who had not. But it would hardly require any very intimate acquaintance with those
					circumstances, any power of divination, or any very profound ability to draw up such a
					statement as that which Scott <pb id="VAB8204-080" n="67"/> brought to the attention of
					the government, for all of it, save Scott's connection with the Earl of Berkshire, had
					ceased to be even news. And while we may admit, with Mr. Pollock, that the surprising
					thing about this information is its moderation, we may not, in view of Scott's history, be
					willing to agree with him that this is any necessary proof of its truth or of Scott's
					importance as a witness.</p>
				<p>In any event, every one is agreed that nothing came of it. The Long Island real estate
					dealer was not destined to occupy a niche in that temple of fame presided over by the
					pious Dr. Oates--at least for the present. And this negative conclusion seems justifiable
					on the ground of certain other testimony not wholly impertinent to the case. For a Mrs.
					Escott, sometime servant to the Earl of Berkshire, testified presently that Scott showed
					her master a map of the places in England which were to be taken by the French, that he
					often entertained the Earl with "stories of ye cheats hee has put upon ye world in several
					places," that they both agreed that innocent blood had been shed over the Plot, that Scott
					went to mass and passed as a Roman Catholic, that Benson, "a rogue," also came to see the
					Earl, who a month before he died "was so deaf that no stranger spoke to him but as shee
					went to him and hallowed it in his ears." Which testimony, inasmuch as it was taken in
					another matter, may perhaps be not unworthy to set beside--or even against--Scott's
					entertaining narrative of Berkshire's last hours, and may, perhaps, even modify somewhat
					the importance attached to Scott's testimony by Mr. Pollock.</p>
				<p>However that may be, Scott no longer appears as a witness to the Plot proper. None the
					less he was not idle. For scarcely had he emerged from this exploit when he began to
					figure in another and scarcely less interesting <pb id="VAB8204-081" n="68"/> episode
					which grew directly out of that frenzy. This was the attack made on Samuel Pepys,
					Secretary to the Admiralty, and on Sir Anthony Deane, his colleague, for furnishing
					information to the French government concerning English naval affairs and, incidentally,
					for Pepys' alleged Catholicism, which, under the Test Act, would have cost him his place.
					Here Scott was cast for a leading part.</p>
				<p>The plot developed clearly and rapidly. On the 27th of Ocetober, 1678, ten days after the
					discovery of Godfrey's body, a certain Captain Charles Atkins laid before Secretary Henry
					Coventry information against a friend and namesake of his, one Samuel Atkins, clerk to
					Samuel Pepys, which, however vaguely, seemed to point to some obscure connection between
					the accused and Godfrey's murder. Three days later he appeared before the Privy Council.
					On November 1 he swore to his statement before a justice of the peace, and Samuel Atkins
					was promptly seized, carried before the committee of inquiry of the House of Lords, where,
					in spite of every inducement to give testimony unfavorable to the Duke of York and his
					party, he indignantly denied the whole story. Thence he was sent to Newgate. A new
					informer, Bedloe, was pressed into service against him, other witnesses summoned, and on
					February 11, 1679, he was brought to trial. There the case collapsed. The witnesses were
					vague and unsatisfactory, the prosecution weak, and at the crisis of the trial Atkins
					produced an alibi so strong that the case was dismissed, an effort to prove the accused a
					Roman Catholic broke down ignominiously, and he was triumphantly vindicated on every
					count.</p>
				<p>But the men behind this case, Shaftesbury and Buckingham at their head, did not rest
					here. Scarcely had Atkins been acquitted on the ground of the alibi, which had been
					prepared by his master, when the attack was directed <pb id="VAB8204-082" n="69"/> against
					Pepys himself. It was some time getting under way, but once it began it assumed formidable
					proportions. On the 20th of May, 1679, Mr. William Harbord, M.P. for Thetford, reported to
					the House of Commons from the Committee of Enquiry into the Miscarriages of the Navy "some
					miscarriages of Sir Anthony Deane and Mr. Pepys relating to Piracy &amp;c." These related
					ostensibly to the fitting out of a privateer from government stores six years before,
					securing for her a French commission, and employing her against the Dutch, with whom
					England was then at war. But it appeared almost immediately that the matter was far deeper
					than this. For the first witness and the first piece of evidence submitted to the
					committee and by them to the House was Colonel Scott and his testimony.</p>
				<p>That gentleman, as always, provided an interesting narrative. "Having been acquainted
					with several great men belonging to the navy," he began, "by their death he was now
					discharged from privacy, things being settling in England." "M. Pelisary, Treasurer
					General of the French King's navy," he deposed, "had shown him draughts of English
					ship-models, the government of the Admiralty, the strength and condition of the English
					navy, its methods of fighting, maps and soundings of the Medway and Kent shores, and of
					the Isle of Wight, plans of Sheerness and Tilbury, all signed by Mr. Pepys, who, it
					appears, received for them some £40,000. But," he added, with his wonted caution, "there
					is a mystery in this, more than I dare speak of." With that regard for religion and that
					high sense of patriotism which he showed at all times in his career, Scott testified that
					hereupon he had said to Pelissary, who was a Protestant, "I hope these rogues that have
					betrayed their country are not of our 'Religion.'" Pelissary answered, "They are of the
					Devil's Religion; let us drink off our wine."</p>


				<pb id="VAB8204-083" n="70"/>

				<p>Such evidence, despite its clear and convincing presentation, it may well be imagined,
					did not go wholly unchallenged. There being some efforts "to take off Scott's testimony,"
					Harbord observed that he would like to present two other witnesses. The story of one of
					them at least could hardly have afforded him much comfort, since the witness merely
					deposed that five years before he had been refused the command of the frigate <hi rend="i"
						>Jersey</hi> by Pepys, and further that a short time before he had heard Scott declare
					that Pepys was "a great betrayer of his country and in time he would make it appear, and
					that Pepys was one of the Arch-Traytors of the Kingdom." To this he added that he had
					"heard Pepys commend the Catholics for their constancy in Religion"--which last was, save
					at this time, perhaps, no hanging matter.</p>
				<p>With that we come to the real root of the matter. Passing by the charge that Pepys had
					sold his country's secrets to France, Harbord pounced on the charge of Papacy. "There had
					been," he said truly enough, "reflections upon Pepys formerly as to his Religion, and by
					collateral proof I shall much convince the House that he is not of our Religion. I am
					sorry," he added, "I must say it of a man I have lived well withal." That there had been
					rumors of Pepys' Catholicism--as of that of every man in any way connected with the Duke
					of York, who was Lord High Admiral--was true enough. What Harbord omitted to say that
					neither on the occasion he mentioned nor on any other had there appeared any ground
					whatever for such a charge.</p>
				<p>That ground now appeared in the evidence of John James of Glentworth, Lincolnshire,
					sometime Pepys' butler, now, for obvious reasons, not in that service. He deposed that
					there was one Morello who used to say mass at the Queen's Chapel, St. James's, Somerset
					House and Whitehall. He <pb id="VAB8204-084" n="71"/> had heard this man say that he had
					studied at Rome. "He had Beads and Pictures, and a private door to his room. He used to
					carry a pistol and a dagger and went often into St. James's Park, and went to Pepys's
					house at Chelsea. He was frequently shut up with Pepys in his closet singing of Psalms
					often till three o'clock in the morning. He was a learned man and would dispute with Pepys
					in Philosophy. When a Proclamation was out for Papists to go out of Town, Pepys helped him
					away with his Papers and Books." When James added to this the statement that Pepys had
					said there was no employment in the navy for any man save by favor of the Duke the case
					was complete.</p>
				<p>In brief, it was sought to prove that Morello was a dangerous man--as must appear to the
					most casual reader of this damning indictment! James' story was true. At any other time
					and under any other circumstances the fact that one had as a friend a man who shared his
					tastes in music and learning or even that he sat up until three in the morning singing
					psalms with him, would have been laughed out of court as proof that he shared that
					friend's religious views or that he was a danger to the state. That men obtained
					employment in the navy by favor of the Lord High Admiral was hardly surprising, much less
					ground for an accusation of either treason or Popery. But at this precise moment men were
					being sent to the block on evidence no less flimsy. Sir John Hotham rose promptly to add
					that he had spoken to Oates in the lobby and that Oates told him he knew Morello as a
					Jesuit who had "importuned to have charge of the English business." Another leader of the
					Country Party, Garroway, declared this was "evidently one of the branches of the Plot."
					"We have a Land-Plot," said he, "this is a Sea-Plot." Sergeant Maynard declared this was
					almost as bad as the charges against the Lords in the Tower, and that the papers should be
					put in the Speaker's charge.</p>



				<pb id="VAB8204-085" n="72"/>

				<p>Then Pepys spoke. First he traversed Harbord's whole statement. He had, he said, been a
					member of Harbord's committee, he had attended its meetings, and he had never heard there
					any accusation either from Scott or from James. He denied that the Admiralty or he himself
					had ever known about the alleged privateering scheme detailed by Harbord. "As for the
					charge of Col. Scott (Lord! Sir.) ...This Gentleman I know not, nor ever saw: I know
					neither his name nor quality, where is his abode or dependencies," unless he was the man
					who under the name of Godfrey was sought by and escaped the officers not long since at
					Gravesend, Deal and Dover, but in whose London lodgings the Lord Mayor found "papers of
					ill importance .. . just such papers as he accuses me of." All charges made by Scott Pepys
					solemnly and categorically denied. As to James, he turned him away for being in the
					housekeeper's room at three o'clock Sunday morning. As for Morello, he was sent to Pepys
					by one Hill; he was a good scholar and a master of music, harmless and moderate in
					opinions, and he could and would at the desire of the House appear to clear himself. Deane
					followed in the same strain. To Scott's charges he replied that he had, in fact, built two
					boats for the French King--to be used on the Grand Canal at Versailles in three feet and a
					half of water! He declared, moreover, that a member of the House lately in Paris named
					Scott as one giving intelligence to the French court.</p>
				<p>Then followed a sharp debate. Sir Joseph Williamson, Scott's old friend and patron,
					although he refrained from all mention of Scott, must have had him in mind, for he
					vigorously seconded Deane. Sacheverell, the Country Party leader, Garroway, and Harbord
					pressed the charge. Sir Francis Rolle added a touch of Rabelaisian humor. <pb
						id="VAB8204-086" n="73"/> Sir William Coventry rose to observe he had had James as a
					butler, that he did not love to do ill offices to one who had served him, but that James'
					service "was not so direct as to recommend him to a friend." Coventry's brother Henry,
					then Secretary of State, contributed two interesting pieces of information. The first was
					that Scott had absconded from London in the preceding October under a misapprehension. The
					government was not looking for him at all but for Conyers, a Jesuit, but Scott's flight
					gave ground for suspicion against him. The second was that Scott had been employed by the
					Prince of Condé to survey his lands. And to this Harbord added two other bits of
					biography--or romance--that Williamson had told him Scott was the ablest man in England,
					and that he had a testimonial from De Witt [who was dead] that he had commanded eight
					regiments of foot for the relief of Flanders. He averred further that a great man had told
					him that some had tried to corrupt Scott to bear false witness against him, "but Scott
					detested it."</p>
				<p>The upshot of the matter was that Pepys and Deane were committed to the custody of the
					Sergeant-at-Arms, with the understanding that they be examined two days later. On that
					occasion Harbord made another attack on them, and they were committed to the Tower. There
					they remained for ten days. On June 2 they were brought before the King's Bench, where the
					Attorney-General refused to allow them to be admitted to bail. Somewhat later, in spite of
					the fact that Scott meanwhile swore to an information on the lines laid down in his
					testimony before the Commons, the Attorney-General changed his mind. The prisoners were
					permitted to offer security in the sum of £30,000--a huge amount for those days--and so
					regained their liberty. In the following February they were released from that obligation,
					Scott having refused <pb id="VAB8204-087" n="74"/> to recognize the truth of his
					deposition and James having confessed that he had concocted his story under Harbord's
					instigation. Nor is it without some small significance in this connection that about this
					time the Duke of Buckingham recommended to Sir Thomas Leet and Mr. Vaughan one J. James,
					sometime in his service, for the post of storekeeper at Woolwich--which casts a certain
					amount of light upon this episode. And so ended the Adventure of the House of Commons.</p>
				<p>What induced Scott to bring these charges of treason and Popery against Pepys? The answer
					is not difficult to guess. The Popish Plot frenzy was at its height. It seemed to
					Buckingham, Shaftesbury and their Whig supporters that, with its aid, they might not only
					be able to displace the Tories in the conduct of affairs, but even exclude the Duke of
					York from the succession--with all the possibilities that such a victory might entail. But
					why attack Pepys? To this three answers have been given. The first is that, ten years
					before, Pepys had been commissioned by the Duke of York to gather evidence in the matter
					of Mrs. Gotherson's appeal to the King for justice against Scott, that it was on the
					strength of this testimony that Scott was driven from place and court, and thereafter
					nourished a grudge against Pepys. The second is the general explanation that Pepys was, in
					his capacity of Secretary of the Admiralty, very close to the Duke, who, until the passage
					of the Test Act, had been Lord High Admiral; that a successful attack on Pepys might well
					involve James, and in any event would have a powerful tendency toward weakening the Duke's
					position before Parliament and the country.</p>
				<p>The third is the answer which, in later years, was given by Scott himself, an answer
					which is perhaps as good an explanation of his own conduct and of the Plot in general <pb
						id="VAB8204-088" n="75"/> as can be found anywhere. "Their Design," said he "was to
					destroy the Government and make themselves Kings, or rather Tyrants, and for that end did
					all they could to bring an odium and hatred upon his Majesty and Family, and by their
					fictions delude a Giddy and unthinking people. Their party was of three sorts. Those that
					wanted office and were disappointed. Those that were enemyes to the Government of Church
					and State, and Fooles that the other two brought over to be of their side."</p>
				<p>And to which of these groups did Scott belong? If we had not his own confession, it would
					be easy to guess. Despite his manifold protestations it is fairly apparent that he was no
					zealot for either church or state; and hitherto, save in a larger sense, he had been a
					knave rather than a fool. In this affair, he admitted, he "acknowledged himselfe a Toole,
					much used, as well as a Cabinett Counsellour." "One that had hoped to be [Pepys']
					successor in the Secretarye's Employment," he declared, "had putt him upon contriving
					[Pepys'] destruction." The design was to take Pepys' life, "but the said person found he
					was not likely to succeed in case they had proceeded." And, he added, Shaftesbury had made
					great promises to him to further this design.</p>
				<p>The scheme was not unpromising. Pepys was a devoted adherent of the Duke of York. Though
					not himself a Catholic, he was no fanatical Protestant. Holding a lucrative office, and
					being a highly efficient public servant, he naturally had enemies. He was thus, under the
					circumstances, a shining mark. But in all the mistakes of a mistaken career, Scott never
					committed a greater error than when he joined in the attack on the Secretary of the Board
					of Admiralty. Pepys was what he was because of his qualities. He had risen by his
					abilities, he had maintained himself not so much by favor as by his courage and <pb
						id="VAB8204-089" n="76"/> intelligence. He had not dealt with dishonest contractors,
					surly sailormen, and shifty courtiers, for fifteen years without acquiring a fairly
					thorough acquaintance with the world and its wickedness, together with some knowledge of
					how to meet the exigencies of life. Moreover, he had an extraordinarily wide acquaintance;
					and, above all, he was, by the accident of fate, set in the precise position, as it
					chanced, to deal with a man like Scott. He had for many years been in the closest touch
					with the navy--and he turned at once to his friend, Captain Dyer. He was the intimate
					friend of the Duke of York, who was the grantee of New York--and he despatched a letter at
					once to the Duke's appointee, Governor Francis Lovelace, for a record of Scott's
					activities in that quarter of the world. He wrote Mrs. Gotherson for information; and to
					Savile, the English ambassador in Paris; and just at this time, by chance, Thomas Lovelace
					turned up in England and agreed to testify for Pepys--or at least against Scott. Pepys had
					married the daughter of a French Huguenot refugee-- and he sent his brother-in-law,
					Bartholomew St. Michel, post-haste to France to secure evidence. Thence after nine months
					he returned, not only with depositions but with witnesses. Besides this, Pepys entrusted a
					Captain Gunman with a similar errand in Holland; and employed a well-known secret-service
					agent, Puckle, on the same task. He wrote to a score of individuals himself. He put into
					action his intimate knowledge of London; he sent to the port towns, where his acquaintance
					was naturally extensive; and he enlisted the services of his many and intimate friends. As
					a result, it seemed that every one Scott had ever injured--and their name was
					legion--presented himself by letter or in person to contribute to this grand assize.</p>
				<p>The consequence was what might have been foreseen. In the Pepys manuscripts in the
					Bodleian Library and in <pb id="VAB8204-090" n="77"/> his own collection, which he
					presented to his college in Cambridge, there are two full volumes of manuscripts, marked
					the Mornamont Papers. Probably nowhere in the world is there so complete a record of the
					activities of a private individual in one place as these manuscripts contain of the doings
					of John Scott. Every twist and turn of his dishonest career, every piece of villainy,
					every shift and device of his shifty and devious life, every exhibition of cowardice,
					dishonesty, untruthfulness, every scheme he entertained, every rebuff he suffered, every
					disgrace and punishment inflicted on him, is there recorded. His obscure origin and his
					poor pretense of gentility, his disreputable actions in America, his cowardice and
					courtmartial in the West Indies, his treachery in England and on the continent, his
					discreditable relations with the governments of the Netherlands, France and his own
					country, his thefts, his plots, his private debts and dishonesty, his efforts at bigamy
					(for he seems to have aspired to the hand of Lady Vane!)--everything, from triple treason
					to the evasion of a board bill, is there set down. Were it not for the fact that so many
					of its statements are corroborated by independent testimony then unknown to Pepys and his
					informants we might almost doubt its accuracy. It is a damning record; and it reveals,
					more clearly than any mere statement can express, one great outstanding fact. There was no
					man in the British Empire, no man in the whole world probably that Scott would not have
					done better to let alone than Samuel Pepys. Reading its manifold testimony to the utter
					worthlessness and untrustworthiness of the man, one is inclined to the belief that of the
					three categories into which Scott himself divided those who entered into the machinations
					of the Popish Plot, he belonged to the third, he was not only a knave, he was a colossal
					fool.</p>



				<pb id="VAB8204-091" n="78"/>
				<p>And whatever else the Popish Plot accomplished, whatever effect it had upon the Duke of
					York and Pepys, however it affected the course of English history, it did one other thing.
					It made an end of John Scott. It is commonly said that the matter was "allowed to drop."
					As a matter of fact, Scott went into hiding, and probably left England for a time. For
					Samuel Pepys was not a man to let such an attempt upon his life go wholly unnoticed, once
					he was clear of the preposterous charges brought against him; nor were the men of the
					court party likely to err on the side of leniency. For the moment, indeed, they did
					nothing against those who had engineered this tremendous attempt to alter the course of
					the English government. The Whigs were still too strong. But when Shaftesbury's last coup
					had failed; when the eloquence of Halifax had defeated the Exclusion Bill; when another
					election had put the House of Commons in the hands of the King and the Whig leader had
					sought refuge in Holland, they struck. A stringent Test Act was passed against the
					Presbyterians; the Scotch Covenanters, who had risen in revolt, were cruelly suppressed;
					and the Duke of Argyle tried and condemned for treason, saved his life only by flight. The
					Duke of York was despatched to Scotland to stamp out the remaining embers of opposition,
					and the King's natural son, the Duke of Monmouth, found his triumphal progress in the
					north cut short by imprisonment. The Duke of Buckingham retired from public life, and the
					Whig cause descended from politics to conspiracy.</p>
				<p>And, at this precise moment, the Lord delivered Scott into the hands of his enemies. With
					the fall of his fortunes, he had begun to drown his sorrows more and more in drink. He had
					always been quarrelsome, he now became what he seems never to have been before either to
					soldiers or servants--dangerous. One evening, being farther gone <pb id="VAB8204-092"
						n="79"/> than usual, he killed a hackney-coachman named Butler, for refusing to carry
					him home to his lodgings from the public-house where he had been spending the evening. The
					occasion was too good to be lost. He was arrested. Immediately two powerful influences
					joined issue over him. On the one side Pepys promptly bestirred himself. He wrote to his
					clerk and friend Hewer, concerning Scott, "whome God is pleased to take out of our hands
					into his own for justice. For should he prevail with the widdow for forgiveness (which in
					some respects I could wish might be prevented) there is the King's pardon behind, which I
					am confident he is able to make relating to the state as well as us, that it might well
					enough atone for this his last vilany. Nor do I doubt but to save his owne life he will
					forget his trade and tell the truth, tho' to the hazard of the best Friends he has, which
					pray let Sir Anthony Deane think of, and of putting in a caveat against his getting any
					pardon from the court (if he should attempt it) till we are first heard."</p>
				<p>Pepys was right. Scott escaped, leaving this time even his famous charts and papers
					behind him. These were promptly appropriated by Pepys and added to the collection already
					secured by the Lord Mayor on the occasion of Scott's earlier flight. Together they formed
					a notable body of literary and cartographical remains. Included among them were accounts
					of proceedings in Parliament, lists of ships, much miscellaneous information relating to
					the army and navy, notes on alchemy, even some poetry. There was the unique copy of the
						<hi rend="i">Help to the Indians,</hi> which by this almost miraculous chance was thus
					preserved to puzzle bibliographers and blacken Scott's reputation among them. There was
					the beginning of his history and description of America; and it is probable that through
					Pepys these came into the hands of his friend Sir Hans <pb id="VAB8204-093" n="80"/>
					Sloane and so ultimately into the British Museum collections, where they still remain.</p>
				<p>Scott himself took refuge in Norway, supported, it was declared, by those who feared his
					return to England. There he was seen in the summer of 1683 by a certain Captain Gelson,
					who promptly wrote of his meeting to Pepys, and of his account of the Popish Plot which we
					have read. It is small wonder that Pepys consulted with Deane as to how they might bring
					him back and so manage affairs that, to save his own skin, he would tell what he knew and
					so ruin "the other party, notably Herbert and other rogues." That purpose they were not
					able to accomplish. He remained safely on the continent, pensioned, it was supposed, by
					these same "rogues" for many years. He did not even dare to return in 1688, when the
					Glorious Revolution brightened the lives of so many patriots. Not until 1695 did he show
					his face in England again, and even then he promptly met with arrest and imprisonment in
					Newgate for coming from France without leave. But he was now a harmless, broken man,
					against whom even Pepys was not willing to move. Moreover, his friends were now in power.
					His old sponsor, Harbord, had been made a privy councillor after the Revolution,
					vice-treasurer for Ireland and finally ambassador to Turkey. He was now dead, but there
					were enough men left of the party which Scott had served to heed his appeal, backed, no
					doubt, by his threats. In the summer of 1696 he was pardoned and, in the words of another
					of his biographers, we are again informed, "we hear no more of him." This, as it was to
					prove, was very far indeed from the fact, but at any rate he seems to have passed shortly
					thereafter from the scene of his earthly activities. And so, for the third time, it would
					appear that was the end of John Scott.</p>
				<p>Finally, what of the family whom he deserted? <pb id="VAB8204-094" n="81"/> Concerning
					them thereare many references. His wife, as we have seen, was given certain of his
					possessions to keep her from starving after his flight. Not to enquire too closely into
					her character and career, she ultimately married a resident of Southampton. There were two
					sons, the elder John, and a younger who rejoiced in the name of Jeckomiah. The former,
					about the time of the Popish Plot, came to England, like Japhet, in search of his father,
					whom, however, he did not find. It is probably to him that this edifying letter was
					addressed. The younger became, in turn, a "Captain," and his somewhat extravagant conduct
					still forms a picturesque page in the annals of Southampton.</p>

				<p>Such is the story of the life of this extraordinary character during those years when he
					played an active part in the affairs of this world for good or ill. It may be there was
					something good in it. I have not been able to find it, for though he lived long and
					touched many sides of life <pb id="VAB8204-096" n="83"/> it seemed always to be the wrong
					side. Yet to it, as to so many other tales, there is an epilogue. From the days when he
					first met the Gothersons and conceived the idea of linking his obscure and anonymous
					origin to that of a family of place and consequence in the world as he knew it, to his
					last endeavors, he never lost sight of this self-imposed gentility. He continually
					described himself as John Scott of Scot's Hall in Kent, in the face of all the facts, and
					of the bitter opposition of that family which sought every means to disavow the
					relationship. He invented a name for his imaginary English domains, Mornamont, and it was
					under the sarcastic title of the Mornamont Papers that Pepys bound up the collections he
					made of Scott's activities when he was defending himself against Scott's charges. He took
					the trouble to have a new and garbled page inserted into a history of Kent to bolster up
					his claim. But it was never allowed--until it was too late. Among the little ironies of
					his ironical history it is worthy of note that when Scott was at last pardoned by the
					government of William III at the solicitation of those who had used him for their
					purposes, he finally achieved his ambition. For that paper describes him as John Scott,
					late of Scot's Hall in the county of Kent, <hi rend="i">Gentleman</hi>. Of all his
					pretensions, this alone was left to him. Almost at once he died; and if he departed not
					wholly in the odor of sanctity, he bore with him at least a distinct aroma of gentility to
					comfort him in his last moments.</p>
				<p>Nor is this all, or even the most entertaining part of the epilogue. Much the most
					important chapter remains--the chapter which relates the adventures of his posthumous
					reputation. If, from whatever limbo he entered on his departure from this world, he could
					have beheld the fortunes of his memory, he would have been filled with exceedingly mixed
					emotions. For two hundred years his <pb id="VAB8204-097" n="84"/> name occurs nowhere
					without some reference to his dubious character and his undoubted rascalities in America,
					in the West Indies, and in those European countries which witnessed or suffered from his
					activities. As late as 1882 a certain G. D. Scull issued an account of what he calls "the
					troubled life" of Dorothea Gotherson, for circulation among her descendants in America,
					and this in the following year he expanded into a volume, which included her writings.
					That volume contains a full if not very accurate account of John Scott and his practices
					toward the Gothersons-- so long does the smart of a land-swindle endure. Some fifteen
					years later Scott was included in the <hi rend="i">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>,
					purely, it would seem from reading its brief and somewhat inaccurate narrative of his
					life, on account of his various villainies, and perhaps as a horrible example. So far he
					had fared as badly at the hands of the historical muse as he had at the hands of his
					outraged contemporaries. But his revenge was ultimate and complete. For as he finally made
					good his claims to the recognition of his gentility by his government, so he seems finally
					to have vindicated his veracity before the bar of history in a manner so surprising and
					unexpected as to deserve more than a passing mention.</p>
				<p>It will be remembered that in the month of April, 1895, the Venezuelan authorities
					brought to a head the long-standing dispute over the boundary between British Guiana and
					Venezuela by the arrest of two members of the British Guiana police for trespassing upon
					Venezuelan territory. The men were released and made their report to their gov-
					government; and Venezuela at once appealed to the United States for aid in the controversy
					which they foresaw would ensue with the British authorities. President Cleveland was
					persuaded, by an appeal to the principles of the Monroe Doctrine, to take up the case, and
					in December of that year <pb id="VAB8204-098" n="85"/> sent to Congress his famous message
					declaring that any attempt by Great Britain to enforce her claims upon Venezuela without
					resort to arbitration would be regarded by the United States as just cause for war.
					Congress supported the attitude of the President, and, in pursuance of the determination
					of both sides, commissions were promptly appointed by Great Britain and the United States
					to investigate the whole question. Each commission engaged the assistance of expert
					lawyers and historians; the United States employing on that work the talents of Professor
					George L. Burr, of Cornell University, and Professor J. Franklin Jameson, then of Brown
					University, the editor of the <hi rend="i">American Historical Review</hi> and more
					recently director of the historical division of the Carnegie Institution. The English
					government appointed a similar body, under the direction of Sir Frederick Pollock; and
					each side set to work to prove its case. The earliest settlements of the Dutch upon the
					Essequibo and the adjacent lands were investigated, the earliest maps collected and
					compared, and an amount of light shed upon the beginnings of European occupation in that
					quarter of the world which was of the utmost value and interest to historians.</p>
				<p>And, conspicuous among the witnesses thus summoned to the bar of history was Colonel John
					Scott! For it will be remembered that he not only wrote the beginnings of a projected <hi
						rend="i">Discription of America</hi>, but a <hi rend="i">Relation</hi> of his own
					valiant achievements and adventures in precisely that obscure corner of the world now
					suddenly made the test of good faith and friendship between the two great Anglo-Saxon
					nations which had earlier had the privilege of sharing the blessings of Scott's residence
					among them.</p>
				<p>His testimony did not, indeed, finally determine the question at issue, though he was a
					material witness. But the result was curious in the extreme so far as Scott's <pb
						id="VAB8204-099" n="86"/> fortunes were concerned. Each side found in his statements
					some confirmation of its contention. The Americans-- and it may be noted that he was not
					so favorable to their views--were somewhat prone to rake up the old colonial scores
					against him. The English, despite the account in the <hi rend="i">Dictionary of National
						Biography,</hi> were rather more inclined to admit his testimony without troubling much
					about searching the records for evidence of his character. Each side seems to have more or
					less tacitly assumed that whatever his deeds or misdeeds elsewhere, his account of what he
					saw in the West Indies was, on the whole, tolerably credible. And though the Dutch
					historian Netscher was rather inclined to doubt Scott's geography as well as his history,
					his views were not seriously entertained by either the American or the English
					investigators in whose hands rested the preparation of evidence in the Venezuelan case. In
					consequence, Scott cuts a better figure before this court than before any of the numerous
					tribunals which summoned him as defendant or witness during his lifetime.</p>
				<p>More was to follow. Some six years after the Venezuelan controversy, a relative of Sir
					Frederick Pollock's, John Pollock, published the most elaborate account of the Popish Plot
					which has yet appeared, a work marked, on the whole, by admirable spirit, much knowledge,
					and remarkable ingenuity. In that narrative Scott plays, if not a leading, at least a
					conspicuous part in building up the argument to which Mr. Pollock addresses himself. He
					does not, indeed, commit himself irrevocably to the contention that the Colonel was an
					unimpeachable witness. But, as we have seen, he lays great stress on the fact that Scott
					did have genuine knowledge of the Earl of Berkshire's correspondence, that "the simplicity
					and directness of his relation points to its substantial truth"; and that the moderation
					of his narrative is a further proof of its genuineness. He <pb id="VAB8204-100" n="87"/>
					goes farther still. No one looking for the rewards of a professional informer, he says,
					would have acted as did Colonel Scott; no scoundrel following on the track of Oates and
					Bedloe would ever have concocted such a story; and, in brief, "His information may be
					accepted as genuine." Here, then, we have a clean bill of health. To Pollock, as to those
					who drew up the English side of the Venezuelan case, there was no Scull, no Mornamont
					Papers, not even a <hi rend="i">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>.</p>
				<p>Nor is this all the tale of his long-belated vindication. Some years after the Venezuelan
					controversy was determined, an English historical scholar, the Rev. George Edmundson, than
					whom there is probably no better authority in his particular field, contributed an article
					to the <hi rend="i">English Historical Review</hi> entitled "The Dutch in Western Guiana."
					In the forefront of his contribution he sets out that the American scholars who gathered
					the evidence in the Venezuelan case had endeavored, not without a considerable measure of
					success, to throw discredit on Scott's testimony in its bearing upon the history of Dutch
					colonization in Western Guiana. He continues: "A careful examination of all available
					evidence has led me to form an entirely different opinion upon the trustworthiness of
					Scott." For he declares, "The credibility of a writer relating otherwise unknown
					historical facts depends upon (I) his nearness to the events narrated, (2) his personal
					access to sure sources of information, (3) his motives in writing, (4) his proved accuracy
					in cases where his statements can be verified." All these tests, he concludes, are
					"absolutely satisfactory in the instance of Major Scott." He was in fact the commander of
					the English expedition of 1665-6; and, as Mr. Edmundson says, "he tells us in his preface
					that he had always been a great lover of geography and history, and that from an early age
					he had purposed to <pb id="VAB8204-101" n="88"/> write a large description of all America,
					also that he had personally been upon no less than one hundred and twenty-six islands in
					the Atlantic Ocean, and had travelled over (among other places) a great part of Guiana."
					Whereupon Mr. Edmundson quotes Scott's description of his Herodotean method of research
					and concludes: "It is clear then in the narrative given by Scott of the early history of
					the Dutch colonies in Western Guiana that we are dealing with the narrative of a
					contemporary, familiar with the localities about which he was writing, conversant with all
					the literature upon the subject, including documents and journals in manuscript, and
					having exceptional opportunities for personal commune with men intimately acquainted for a
					long period with the country and its history. It is further important to note that the
					work, which was never published, and of which only a fragment was committed to paper, was
					a long-cherished design, the preparation for which was scientifically thorough, and
					carried on for years; and that it is impossible to attribute to the writer any motives of
					political partisanship, or any other aim than that put forth by himself 'of giving new
					accounts from observations of my owne.' More than this, his claim is fully borne out by
					the accuracy which is shown by him in those parts of the narrative which can be
					historically verified."</p>
				<p>Thus history, like time, whose chronicler it is, brings its revenges. At the hands of
					this learned and reverend gentleman Scott has finally come into his own, even though it
					has taken more than two centuries for him to find any one to believe him so
					whole-heartedly. Perhaps Edmundson is right, perhaps Scott did tell the truth--"some truth
					but not all gospel" is what Willoughby wrote of him, and that judgment still holds after
					two centuries, despite the Pollocks and Mr. Edmundson. It is impossible not to feel a <pb
						id="VAB8204-102" n="89"/> certain regret that such talents as he unquestionably
					possessed should not have somehow worked to better ends. Had he only succeeded somewhere,
					had he secured the grant of Long Island, had he been able to retain his post of
					geographer-royal--but the conjectures are futile. He broke on the rock of the Gotherson
					affair, and that not only deprived him of the sympathy of his own generation, and of its
					successors, it revealed qualities which would at almost any time have made his permanent
					success impossible.</p>
				<p>None the less he is a considerable figure. That he should have done so much to determine
					the fate of Long Island and New York, that he should have contributed to the settlement of
					the boundary between New York and New Jersey while he was alive is remarkable enough. But
					that two centuries after his death he should take such an active part in the adjustment of
					the boundary between Venezuela and British Guiana and cut such a respectable figure in the
					history of the two nations with which his life was so intimately and so scandalously bound
					up, passes the bounds of what we usually regard as probability. What his tongue could not
					accomplish for him while he was alive, his pen did for him among posterity; and if he
					failed in all else it ensured for him a safe corner in a great controversy, from whose
					records he may henceforth look out with some of his old confidence upon a world which,
					with all his wit, he failed to quite deceive while he was still a part of it. Viewing all
					this, it again becomes apparent why so many men appeal from the harsh judgments of their
					contemporaries to the serene tribunal of history.</p>
