            <byline>Willard H. Smith</byline>
            <p>By the close of the Civil War, Schuyler Colfax of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, had become one of the most popular leaders in the Republican party. Elected
                    to the national House of Representatives on the tidal wave of anti-Nebraskaism in 1854, he rose
                    rapidly to a place of party leadership.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> His position as speaker of the house
                    during the troubled years of 1863 to 1869 and his selection as the running mate of Ulysses S. Grant
                    in 1868 are evidence of this fact. But the part which Colfax played in shaping reconstruction policy
                    in the years following the Civil War has usually been underemphasized by historians. Indeed, there
                    has been a tendency to forget the part which Colfax played, for good or ill, in the whole Civil
                    'War period partly because of his involvement in the Credit Mobilier scandal. Then, too,
                    the driving, vindictive Thaddeus Stevens is usually the one held most responsible for the
                    development of radical reconstruction policy, at least so far as the House of Representatives is
                    concerned. But without the aid of Speaker Colfax and others, Stevens' activity would have
                    been of no avail. Colfax was not merely a follower of Stevens in this regard, as some aver,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> but was himself responsible to a considerable extent for radical
                    reconstruction. Although he was speaker of the House and therefore was not expected to take an
                    active part in congressional debate, he played an important part in the formation of reconstruction
                    policy.</p>

            <p>Colfax belonged, of course, to the group known as radical Republicans, though lie was perhaps not
                    quite as extreme as a few members of the group. Like other Radicals he thought at the time of the
                    assassination of Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> that Andrew- Johnson was "cast in a sterner mold" than was his
                    predecessor and that he would make treason odious.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> He was convinced, too, that
                    "the chiefs of this gigantic rebellion of our times" were responsible for the
                    assassination of President <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the summer and fall of 1865 passed, the new President carried forward the political reconstruction
                    of southern states under a plan very similar to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s. Colfax, on a trip by stage coach to the west coast during this time, had
                    little to say by way of criticism of the President's policy until on the eve of the meeting
                    of the Thirty-ninth Congress in December. As a matter of fact, his own earlier position might well
                    have given him pause before deciding to support any program of radical reconstruction. His view was
                    that no act of secession could annihilate the existence of a state; on the contrary he insisted that
                    the sovereignty of such a state still remained with the loyal people. "If the other theory
                    is true," he added, "that a paper act of Secession is a suicide of a State, then
                    the heroic Andrew Johnson has been sitting in the U. S. Senate illegally all winter as a Senator
                    from <placeName>

                    have forgotten entirely these sentiments.</p>
            <p>In October, 1865, Colfax wrote a friend that, while it would be pleasant for southern congressmen to

                    important in our history. A careful student of reconstruction has said that the Thirty-ninth
                    Congress, which met December 4, 1865. stood next to the First in importance.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On November 18, a few days after arriving in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Colfax, in response to a serenade, made an important speech on reconstruction policy.
                    It was evidently a pre-arranged affair. He noted that men from the South who, at the adjournment of
                    Congress the past March, were "struggling to blast this nation from the map of the
                    world" proposed to enter Congress in December to "resume their former business of
                    governing the country they struggled so earnestly to ruin." He observed that the
                    constitution gave to each house the exclusive right to judge the qualifications of the election
                    returns of its members, "and I apprehend they will exercise that right." He then
                    went on to state that President Johnson, in the absence of any law passed by Congress, had
                    prescribed certain requirements which must be met by southern states wishing to be restored to their
                    former relations in the Union. Colfax considered these regulations "eminently wise and
                    patriotic." He felt, however, that additional terms should be imposed on the southern
                    states.</p>
            <p>Stating that the Declaration of Independence must be recognized as the law of the land, he added that
                    Negroes as well as whites must be protected in their rights of person and property and must have the
                    right to testify and sue in the courts of the land. Another condition which the speaker would impose
                    was that of having the new state constitutions ratified by the people. A clear majority of the
                    people in each state, he added, must give evidence of their earnest and cheerful loyalty. He would
                    require also that congressmen be elected who could take the oath which stated that they did not
                    voluntarily take part in the rebellion. He thought there was danger of too precipitate action.
                    "Let us rather make haste slowly," he said, "and we can then hope that
                    the foundations of our Government when thus reconstructed on the basis of indisputable loyalty, will
                    be as eternal as the stars." He concluded his speech with an avowal of faith in the
                    President and optimistically expressed the belief that the executive <list type="footnotes">

                    given close attention by all parties. This was one of the first serious jolts given to presidential
                    reconstruction. Although the speaker said he could not anticipate the action of Congress, it was
                    obvious that he was doing that very thing. The <placeName>

                    regarded in a measure as the key-note of action of the Republicans of Congress." He said
                    the speech indicated that southern congressmen would not be admitted on the floor of Congress at the
                    time of organization, that mature deliberation would characterize reconstruction, that the
                    organization of the Republican party would not be abandoned and that the question of negro suffrage
                    "will not be made primary, but will [be brought forward] in due time."<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>The scene on the opening day of the Thirty-ninth Congress was an interesting, not to say anxious,
                    one. It was known that Southerners would be on hand to demand their seats and that some members of
                    Congress would plead their cause. Long before noon the galleries and corridors were filled with
                    anxious throngs. At the appointed time the clerk of the house, Edward McPherson, called the roll for
                    the election of the speaker but refused to read the names of the representatives of the seceded
                    states. Despite the furious protests of some members, the Republican majority ignored the claims of
                    the southern gentlemen to their seats and proceeded with legislative business. Colfax was re-elected

            <p>After being escorted to the speaker's chair by Representatives Brooks and Justin S. Morrill,
                    the speaker reminded the House of the serious legislative tasks before it. He continued: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Perhaps in no way did the speaker wield greater influence in the shaping of congressional policies in
                    those days than in the appointment of committees. At that time, it should be recalled, the speaker
                    had the sole power of appointment. While strong pressure was exerted upon Colfax to get members upon
                    various committees and while he no doubt listened to advice, it seems that he kept his own counsel
                    in the matter. According to one source close to Colfax, "not five men in the House knew who
                    a single chairman was to be."<hi rend="sup">24</hi> These committees were Radical in
                    composition and great care was exercised in their appointment. Colfax himself later spoke of

            <p>For the next few months after the opening of Congress, it seems that Colfax tried to prevent an open
                    break with President Johnson. Possibly he was influenced somewhat by the sentiments of his friend,
                    Horace Greeley, who, radical though he was, asked the speaker "to take care that we do
                    nothing calculated to drive the President into the arms of our adversaries. Let us respect his
                    convictions and thus impel him to respect ours."<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meantime, the President had delivered to Congress his first message which was able, moderate,
                    and conciliatory. He even pointed out that each house was judge of the elections, returns, and
                    qualifications of its members.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> While the President had the aid of George
                    Bancroft in the framing of this message, he would not have been himself had he accepted any
                    sentiment in the message in which he did not believe. Furthermore, he had earlier indicated his
                    belief that a limited extension of the franchise to the more able Negroes would be desirable.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> During the ensuing holiday recess of Congress, Colfax addressed the <placeName>

                    </placeName> legislature and asked for continued confidence in the President. "Hints of
                    distrust always beget alienation," he said. A few days later in an address at Poughkeepsie, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, he was optimistic enough to say that "no rupture would occur between Congress
                    and the President, and the Union will be constructed in such a manner as will be mutual for ages to
                        come."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, forces were also at work which made a harmonious development of a moderate and
                    reasonable reconstruction policy difficult. No one person or group of persons is wholly to blame for
                    this failure, though the Radicals must bear a very large share of the responsibility. Some were
                    influenced by one motive and some by another. It is not necessary to conclude that humanitarianism
                    was wholly absent from the group, but it must be admitted that the more sordid desire for political
                    gain and economic advantage <list type="footnotes">

                    many of them exaggerated, of the mistreatment of the Negroes at the hands of southern whites greatly
                    inflamed radical opinion. Finally, the lack of diplomacy and tact on the part of the President in
                    dealing with men made harmony still more difficult to attain. <hi rend="i">Colfax himself seemed
                        actuated</hi> by this whole complex of forces rather than by any one factor. Serious and
                    impartial study of his life makes it difficult, if not impossible, to avoid the conclusion that a
                    humanitarian desire to help an unfortunate people was one factor which motivated him. But it must be
                    quickly added that he was sufficiently shrewd as a politician to know that harping on the rights of
                    the blacks and waving the "bloody shirt" was good politics in northern Indiana.
                    Since he came from a growing industrial community, it is easy to think that he might have desired to
                    hold up the re-entrance of southern influence into our national councils until the financial and
                    economic program of northern industrialists was better established. While it seems that this was to
                    some extent a motivating influence in his life, Colfax was western as well as northern and thus no
                    consistent pattern of evidence can be found on this point.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Hence, whatever the
                    forces were, the pressures produced by them made it difficult for bigger men than Colfax to keep
                    their balance in this all-too-heated period.</p>
            <p>By April, 1866, the break between the speaker and President had occurred. To a friend, the former

                    his position more emphatic, wanted his name called as a member of the House. The Radicals greeted
                    with applause the announcement of his affirmative vote.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Shortly thereafter, in
                    response to a serenade by fellow-Hoosiers, he not only defended congressional reconstruction, but
                    also said that the record that his party had made "will shine with brighter glory on our
                    Country's page than any other in the annals of our history." Terming the Civil
                    Rights Act as the American Magna Charta, he added that the people must look to Congress and to
                    Congress alone for "legalized reconstruction." Colfax concluded as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>You will ask, perhaps, what is my policy of reconstruction. I will tell you in a few words.
                            It is the policy of reconstruction laid down by Andrew Johnson with such emphasis and
                            earnestness in his speeches made to the public between the month of June, 1864, and the

            <p>The tendency of Colfax to assume that Johnson had greatly shifted his position between 1864 arid 1866
                    was a common error of the Radicals. It is true that Johnson was by the latter date using less
                    vindictive language about southern "rebels," but that was simply because he
                    realized that the war was over while the Radicals apparently did not. In a letter on April 21, the
                    speaker wrote: <text>

                            our own, and as we turn for light does it not flash upon us that He again requires the
                            nation to conquer its prejudices? that He, so far above us, who has put all human beings on
                            an equality before Divine law, demands that we should put all on an equality before human

            <p>The sequel proved such was the case. The new reconstruction legislation, passed over the
                    President's veto on March 2, 1867, provided for virtual military government of the southern
                    states until they adopted and ratified constitutions which provided among other things for negro
                    suffrage and the disqualification of ex-Confederate leaders. This and supplementary legislation had
                    the hearty support of Colfax and, together with the Tenure of Office Act passed at the same time,
                    had the effect of maneuvering the President into a position of virtual helplessness. Quite properly
                    he struck back at this unconstitutional disruption of our check-and-balance system, but to no avail.</p>

                    Particularly unique was the fact that the valedictory address of the speaker of the closing Congress
                    and the inaugural of the speaker of the next should be given in the same hour and by the same man,
                    for it was understood that Colfax would be elected speaker for the third time. In his inaugural
                    address the speaker praised the work of the preceding Congress and said it was their duty
                    "to so make history that posterity shall rise up and call us blessed." He thought
                    it would be fortunate for the new Congress if, at its end, it could "point to a record
                    which will shine on our historic page like that of the Congress which has just expired."<hi rend="sup">42</hi> Unfortunately, "posterity" has not been able to agree with

                    departments. In demand as a public speaker on various occasions, Colfax used his oratorical powers

                    from the battlements of heaven," also accepted the situation; but he did not get back into
                    the courts of heaven. Lewis T. Powell, who called himself Payne, the would-be assassin of William H.
                    Seward, also accepted the situation; but he was hanged. And so, said Colfax, might any unrepentant

            <p>As to the President, whose recent action in asking for the resignation of Secretary of War Edwin M.
                    Stanton had added fuel to the flames, Colfax arraigned him for failing to execute the laws<hi rend="sup">45</hi> and for violating his oath. He thought the chief executive ought to have,
                    "like all others, who are charged with offenses, the opportunity before that tribunal made
                    by the Constitution, to vindicate himself from these grave charges of the people against
                    him." Colfax continued, "I can say of our President, in the language of holy writ:
                    ‘May his days be few, and may another take his office,’<hi rend="sup">46</hi>
                    I mean, of course his official days." He praised Stanton in high terms and promised that
                    after Congress met the secretary would come back to the Department of War. The President, continued
                    the speaker, "has no right to have a policy," except that contained in the laws.
                    Colfax's remarks on these points, as well as those on negro suffrage, were all that the
                    most intense Radical could desire. In fact, in answer to the charge of Radicalism, the speaker
                    replied: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>The fall elections in a number of states in 1867 went against the Republicans. It was the most
                    serious reaction since 1862 and caused no little concern. For Colfax and others, however, the
                    election reverses did not mean a backing down on reconstruction. His considered judgment as voiced

            <p>In the meantime, Congress had reconvened at its usual time. The big question before the congressmen
                    during this session was the impeachment and trial of the President. While there had been some talk
                    of impeachment for nearly two years, the movement did not gain serious headway until the regular
                    meeting of the Fortieth Congress in December, 1867. As indicated above, Colfax was already in favor
                    of impeachment. When the Chicago <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> published some misleading statements in
                    regard to his position on impeachment, he wrote the editor that he was impatiently waiting for
                    Congress to meet in order that that body might send Stanton back to the War Department and that it
                    might furnish a proper tribunal before which the President could defend himself against grave
                    charges. He added that while he did not believe<quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Mr. Johnson dared to fulfil the threats against Congress now being made by his Washington
                            organs, apparently in his name, yet whoever did dare to destroy the Legislative department
                            of the government, by revolutionary force, whether President, Cabinet Minister, or citizen,
                            would be tried for his treason, and punished as a traitor, with his feet, not like traitors
                            of the present rebellion, on the earth, but in the air.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>

            </p>
            <p>When the Senate voted in January, 1868, that the reasons Johnson gave for the removal of Stanton were
                    not sufficient, the secretary secured the keys and went back to his old office in the War
                    Department. A large delegation of House members, headed by the speaker, called on Stanton to ask him
                    to remain at his post under all circumstances. Colfax stated that<quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>since the passage of the tenure–of–office law Mr. Stanton had become an
                            officer of the people, and not removable without the consent of the Senate; that he ought
                            not to resign unless the people demanded it and that the people wanted and expected him to
                            retain his place.</p>
                    </quote> The speaker then referred to him as the Thermopylae, the pass of the greatest value to
                    congressional reconstruction and as the one on whom the safety of reconstruction rested. He was

                    praised Stanton as one who carried his colors openly and as one who represented more than anyone
                    else the policy of Lincoln and the spirit of the people who crushed the rebellion and who were
                    determined that that victory stand to give peace to the country.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> It thus
                    appears that Colfax was one of the leaders in the plot to "use" Stanton in the
                    cabinet.</p>
            <p>In February, 1868, the long–threatened action against the President took place. When the
                    House resolved that "Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, be impeached of high
                    crimes and misdemeanors in office," the speaker asked to have his vote cast in favor of the
                        resolution.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> The fact that the House first voted to impeach and <hi rend="i">afterward</hi> formulated their reasons typifies the sorry character of the whole
                    disgraceful proceeding. The committee which Colfax appointed to report articles of impeachment was
                    headed by Thaddeus Stevens. Most of the articles centered around the alleged violation of the Tenure
                    of Office Act by the attempted removal of Stanton. Not since the assassination of Lincoln had
                    Washington and the country as a whole been so excited as it was during these days. The wildest
                    rumors of violence were afloat. Even the speaker seems to have been affected by them. For example, a
                    Mr. Kennedy, the chief of the New York police, wrote to the speaker to the effect that some
                    nitro–glycerine had disappeared from New York and that he did not know where it had gone
                    unless to Washington. "The chivalrous and timid speaker," wrote Secretary Welles,
                    "at once laid this tremendous missive before the House, and the consternation of the
                    gallant band of Radicals became excessive."<hi rend="sup">55</hi> Before impeachment
                    proceedings were started, Colfax wrote to James A. Garfield in Europe:<text>

            <p>Colfax shared the confidence of the Radicals in the certainty of the President's conviction.
                    "Impeachment <hi rend="i">will</hi> succeed. Have faith," he wrote in the spring
                    of 1868. If it failed, he continued, a "suffering and till now forbearing people"
                    knew that Johnson would be "for the remaining year an uncontrolled despot, worse than ever
                    before, with civil war probably in the fall, when he would have all the Rebels vote down South
                    &amp; exclude the loyal colored people."<hi rend="sup">58</hi> Like other Radicals the
                    speaker blamed "that persistent nullifier of law" for all the ills of the country
                    and thought that with Senator Benjamin F. Wade in the presidency "we may hope for revived
                    prosperity, just reconstruction, and national peace."<hi rend="sup">59</hi> It seems,
                    however, that the prosperity which the Radicals were particularly interested in reviving was that
                    which comes from office–holding. Senator Wade in the president's chair could
                    give the initial impulse and negro votes in the South could guarantee its continuance.<hi rend="sup">60</hi>

                    pause to some people who thought that Wade in the presidential chair would be little improvement
                    over Johnson. It appears that some had hoped it might be possible for Colfax, next in line after

                            <p>"Now is the time to educate the South into a new school of politics. If we fail
                                to embrace the present opportunity for building up true Republicanism there, we need not
                                be surprised if the old rebel leaders sway the new as they did the old

                    Johnson still more certain in that those having an antipathy to Wade would not need to fear about
                    their votes for conviction making the senator President.</p>
            <p>The story was even circulated to the effect that Wade, Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts, and
                    Colfax had made a bargain along these lines: Wade was to vote for conviction and then resign, thus
                    leaving the presidency to Colfax. Wilson and Colfax, who, with Wade, were candidates for the
                    Republican vice–presidential nomination, were then to step out of this race and leave the
                    price to Wade. In an interview, with the Washington correspondent of the Providence <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>, however, Senator Wade declared that he had never thought of resigning as
                    President. Thus, while not a few would probably have preferred Colfax to Wade, it is not likely that
                    these stories of a deal were taken seriously.<hi rend="sup">61</hi> Even though the conviction of
                    Johnson would have made Wade President, which through the patronage power would have given him an
                    advantage in his race for the vice–presidency, Colfax seems not to have been deterred by
                    these considerations in his hope for conviction.<hi rend="sup">62</hi>

                    shared their intense dislike, not to say hatred, for the seven courageous Republicans who, with the
                    Democrats, voted against conviction. Balked at this point, they were determined to make the election
                    of 1868 another referendum on reconstruction. While some still raised questions about
                    Grant's solidity on reconstruction, for most of them he had become Radical enough to be
                    "let … into the church."<hi rend="sup">63</hi> Colfax himself had
                    earlier been in a receptive mood and was talked about for first place on the ticket, but long since

                    that, since all the leading candidates met that qualification, reconstruction policy had no bearing
                    on the vice–presidential nomination.</p>
            <p>In addition to the factor of personal popularity, Colfax himself admitted the influence of the
                    Methodist conference held at the same time and place<hi rend="sup">65</hi> in bringing about his
                        nomination.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> The fact that Colfax was a temperance man probably heightened
                    the regard of the Methodists for him.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> Colfax himself did not take an active
                    part in the campaign until October. Since Grant was not inclined toward public speaking and Colfax
                    was, the greater burden fell upon the latter. His usual strategy in his speeches was to rekindle the
                    Civil War prejudices, defend congressional reconstruction, and praise both the hero of Appomattox
                    and the record of the Republican party. His waving of the "bloody shirt" was quite
                    pronounced. In one speech he praised the scalawags and the carpetbaggers as the "best men
                    of the South" —those whom these<quote rend="blockquote">

                    </quote> At Detroit, again waving the "bloody shirt," Colfax asked his audience
                    whether there was a man there who was going to vote Democratic. If so, he said, he wanted to say a

            <p>In another effort the nominee said the Republican party stands upon God–given principles
                    and allies its cause "with the Eternal throne itself." He would not wonder, he
                    added, "if in the ages of Eternity they [Negroes] may sit in higher places than their
                    miserable defamers."<hi rend="sup">70</hi> These excerpts are sufficient to show the type
                    of campaign which Colfax waged. The issue of finances he seems to have side–stepped, for
                    the reason perhaps that many western Republicans were themselves enamored with the greenback
                    "heresy."</p>
            <p>With his election as vice–president, Colfax ceased to be an active influence in the
                    further development of reconstruction policy. Indeed, its main outlines had long since been formed.
                    In the occasional addresses given he continued to defend radical reconstruction; and despite
                    occasional rumors of difference between him and his chief, he seems to have been a strong defender
                    of the Grant administration against a growing number of attacks. Poor reward was it then in 1872
                    when, for various reasons,<hi rend="sup">71</hi> the Republicans failed to renominate Colfax and
                    selected instead Henry Wilson. On March 4, 1873, he retired from public life under the Credit
                    Mobilier cloud and never sought to vindicate himself through re–election to any office,
                    though to his dying day he protested his innocence. Colfax remained regular in his party
                    affiliations in 1872, as indeed he did throughout his life, despite the treatment he received at the
                    Republican convention that year, and despite his friendship for Greeley and the support given the
                    Liberal Republican candidate by many of his friends. As to reconstruction, it was difficult for
                    Colfax, Radical that he was, to follow the more moderate policy of his party under President
                    Rutherford B. Hayes. As a good friend of Hayes, however, he wrote the newly inaugurated President
                    that "whether conciliation will concilate or not, I and glad, &amp; so are the vast
                    numbers, that it is to be tried…"<hi rend="sup">72</hi>

            <p>A sounder scholarship since Colfax's day has shown that on many phases of reconstruction
                    policy Colfax and the other Radicals were wrong and their political opponents were right. But in
                    maintaining that position, Colfax was simply a representative of his section; and for good or ill,
                    he was an important influence in moulding the position taken by his section and by Congress.</p>

            <p>In recent years much emphasis has been placed on certain possible subtle purposes involved in the
                    framing of the Fourteenth Amendment. Such writers as Charles and Mary Beard have emphasized
                    suspected economic motives in such a vivid manner that some writers have come to ignore other and
                    possibly more potent factors. While their interest has been largely absorbed in the possibility of
                    framers' seeking to safeguard corporations against hostile legislation, they have tended to
                    minimize the rather clear evidence concerning immediate political objectives. Scholars have been
                    inclined to refrain from an analysis of what most framers and party leaders in general hoped to
                    achieve by means of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
            <p>The evidence for such a study, found in the private letters and public speeches of participants as
                    well as in the newspaper comment of the period, leads us down an open road with easily seen
                    milestones to the following conclusions:<list type="simple">
                  <item>1. That the basic purpose of Radicals in 1865 and 1866 was party control.</item>
                  <item>2. That they desired negro suffrage as a means to this end.</item>
                  <item>3. That when efforts to secure negro suffrage through executive action in 1865 had failed,
                            Radicals turned to Congress and used popular agitation to bring pressure to bear on that
                            body.</item>
                  <item>4. That it soon became evident that public opinion would not sustain such a step by
                            Congress in 1866.</item>
                  <item>5. That Radicals then came to realize that some statement of policy must be framed which
                            would offer to all Republicans a common meeting ground and which would present an attractive
                            platform to voters then clamoring for a restoration plan.</item>
                  <item>6. That the Fourteenth Amendment, this political platform, was not a Radical document but
                            one that compromised all Radical purposes in the name of temporary political expediency.</item>
                  <item>7. That its object was not to settle the issue of reconstruction, but to postpone a
                            settlement, while maintaining party control, until such a time as public opinion would
                            endorse what was deemed necessary for party security—negro suffrage.</item>

            <p>With the return of peace in the spring of 1865, divisions already present within the Republican party
                    were accentuated by the new problem of restoration. Now that the Negro's freedom from
                    slavery was assured, the extreme faction known as Radicals began intensive agitation for his
                    enfranchisement. This was deemed politically expedient; for representatives from restored states,
                    selected by an unchanged electorate, could be expected to cooperate with the existing congressional
                    minority of northern Democrats.</p>
            <p>For a time it was thought that Abraham Lincoln's successor might help the Radicals achieve
                    their purpose through executive power and influence. Before long, however, Andrew Johnson's
                    North Carolina proclamation indicated that too much dependence on his support would be unwise. Delay
                    was then urged, while strenuous efforts were made to create a public sentiment calculated to
                    influence the Thirty–ninth Congress for negro suffrage. Wendell Phillips had already
                    urged Charles Sumner to "begin on agitation—we will see that it reaches the
                    Senate doors by December."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Nevertheless, until a more propitious
                    moment, it was thought best by many to maintain the outward appearance of party unity. Possibly the
                    administration might yet be drawn into the Radical orbit. The cabinet itself included at least three
                    members who favored the extremists' program.</p>
            <p>Several congressmen who later figured prominently in the framing of the Fourteenth Amendment
                    committed themselves definitely in favor of negro suffrage in the summer of 1865. John A. Bingham of
                    Ohio, George S. Boutwell of Massachusetts, Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, Jacob M. Howard of
                    Michigan, and William P. Fessenden of Maine expressed their approval during this time. All were to
                    serve on the joint committee which shaped the amendment. Stevens and Fessenden were chairmen of the
                    House and Senate portions respectively. The latter presided at its joint sessions. These men took
                    their stand for black voters more on the basis of national safety through continued control of the
                    Republican party than on broad humanitarian principles.</p>
            <p>Howard of Michigan wished to "put it on the ground of public safety and necessity."
                    He urged New Englanders, with their record of humanitarian arguments, to refrain <list type="footnotes">

                    James Harlan, voiced his support, but declared that negro suffrage could not be expected for some
                        time.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Henry Winter Davis, as zealous as any for the colored vote, shared
                    Harlan's lack of optimism. On such an issue, he was convinced that the Radicals would
                    "certainly be beaten." Despite these fears, Davis predicted that delay would allow
                    the old "coalition" to regain power.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Gloomily he voiced his
                    fear that Johnson's policies would consign "the great Union, or Republican party,
                    bound hand and foot, to the tender mercies of the rebels." Continuation of the present
                    system without negro suffrage seemed to him to mean simply political suicide for his party.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In answer to those who feared improper use of the ballot by the Negro, Ben Butler expressed this
                    practical Radical analysis: "If the master votes right, let the negro vote with him. If the
                    master votes wrong, then we gain the chance that the negro may not vote with the master. That chance
                    is worth something. Thus we gain and can lose nothing by giving the negro the right to
                        vote."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By late summer most Radicals had given up the President as useless for their purpose. Despite this
                    reaction, they feared to break openly with Johnson and conservative Republicans, for this would
                    accomplish what they most dreaded—the return of Democrats to power. They preferred to
                    continue their crusade privately while apparently remaining in harmony with the administration. Men
                    of this conviction, like Harlan of Johnson's cabinet, were prepared to accept the nearest
                    thing to negro suffrage that could be obtained.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>When elections in northern states where negro suffrage was an issue gave evidence of popular
                    disapproval, most congressional leaders came to accept the more prudent course of falling back to
                    less extreme positions till a better opportunity should offer itself.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
                    Consternation over these early election returns brought forth the kind of letter that James A.
                    Garfield wrote to Salmon P. Chase: "If we shall not be able to maintain the fight on the
                    suffrage question alone—should we not make a preliminary resistance to immediate
                    restoration and thereby gain time?"<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Radical speakers and the Radical
                    press qualified their previous unequivocal statements and began privately to urge the preparation of
                    the public mind for negro suffrage by methods which they termed "education."</p>
            <p>Frightened Radicals, subdued by the feeling that the time was not ripe for negro suffrage, showed a
                    growing tendency to consider the use of "other topics, nearer to the popular appreciation
                    … to unite enough to prevent final action for the present."<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some thought it less possible to nullify Democratic votes in the South by negro ballots than to
                    reduce the voice of the entire section in Congress. Formerly blacks had been reckoned at
                    three–fifths of their actual number, but as freedmen they must be counted on an equal
                    basis with others, thus swelling the representation of recently rebellious states. To many in the
                    North this would not be tolerable. By presenting to seceded states the alternative of negro suffrage
                    or reduced representation as a condition of restoration, the problem might be solved.</p>
            <p>Among the several proposals to achieve this end, a plan to change the basis of representation from
                    population to voters received wide support for a time. This was soon dis– <list type="footnotes">

                    affect all sections of the North equally. Any tampering with relative representation among loyal
                    states was recognized as political dynamite.</p>
            <p>Other popular topics eagerly grasped by those politicians seeking substitute issues included the
                    guaranteeing of all national obligations. These would embrace pensions and other claims as well as
                    bonds. Although no opposition to such payment is apparent, Radicals built up a phobia that the
                    return of southern representatives to Congress, where their coalition with northern Democrats was
                    predicted, would lead to repudiation. One purpose of this movement is obvious upon examination of
                    Radical statements that negro suffrage in the South would effectively counteract these dangers.
                    Agitation for financial guarantees progressed so far that the secretary of the treasury begged its
                    instigators to pause lest the national credit suffer.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Sentiment for
                    disqualification of ex–Confederates, though a natural growth, well suited Radical
                    purposes. The movement to guarantee civil rights, sponsored originally by the more conservative
                    Republicans, received emphasis from Radicals only when state elections indicated that suffrage would
                    not serve as a party platform.</p>
            <p>In fact, negro suffrage had been so completely withdrawn in favor of other more acceptable topics
                    that Schuyler Colfax, speaking a fortnight before Congress convened in Washington, refrained from
                    any reference to negro suffrage.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> This seems especially significant since he
                    was soon to be elected speaker of the house, and his words were to be widely circulated as the voice
                    of the Republican majority.</p>
            <p>As Congress assembled, the movement to amend the Constitution precipitated a veritable avalanche of
                    proposals centering around the negro problem. John Greenleaf Whittier's greeting

                    of securing the "perpetual ascendency of the party of the Union." Specifically,
                    Stevens hoped to reduce the South's representation in Congress by "about
                    thirty–seven" or "to divide the representation and thus continue the
                    Republican ascendency."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even those who were not eager for negro suffrage appreciated the value of reducing Southern
                    representation. While Radicals wished to obtain negro suffrage as the price of southern recognition
                    in Congress, the more moderate desired, as a matter of safety, to reduce the South's quota
                    of representatives. It seemed, too, as the <hi rend="i">Nation</hi> pointed out, that it probably
                    would not encounter executive opposition and would be "an entirely safe issue for this
                        Congress…"<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Most Radicals realized the inopportuneness of an election campaign based on negro suffrage. Signs all
                    pointed to the failure of such a move. James G. Blaine later wrote of the "ample excuse for
                    the reluctance of leading statesmen to adopt it as a condition of reconstruction, and force it upon
                    the South by law before it had been adopted by the moral sense of the North."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Radicals liked to hear the babble of voices offering multitudes of panaceas, for that meant
                    precious months of delay. "This discussion will go on for months," wrote Sumner,
                    "nor do I think it desirable to stop it. At last the evidence as reported will show the

            <p>Colfax, speaker of the house, was just as aware of the political dangers of disunion and of taking a
                    position in advance of the people. Scrawled beneath a group of suggestions which he turned over to
                    the joint committee were these words: "On reflection I think the more <hi rend="i">general</hi> you make your plan when first presented the stronger it will be, avoiding carping as
                    to details and verbage. Then if it strikes the public mind of Congress and the country favorably the

                    requires." Colfax had first thought that the amendment should be ratified by conventions.
                    He had later crossed out that word and had substituted "legislatures." His reason
                    for this change is not known, but his analysis of the political situation indicates a possible
                    motive. Interestingly enough, Colfax, while wishing to avoid a popular test of the amendment in
                    northern states, wished to provide that a majority of southern voters must approve. It is suggestive
                    of Speaker Colfax's outlook that the suffrage question is not even mentioned in his
                        proposals.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Another communication of the speaker indicates that he would
                    have liked to postpone many issues till the next Congress, when he hoped that Radicals would be
                    stronger in both houses.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> There seems to have been a recognized danger of
                    pressing for too much too soon.</p>
            <p>When Stevens faced the House to urge the adoption of the joint committee's resolution on
                    representation—which would deprive the South of votes in that body in proportion to
                    Negroes denied the vote—he freely predicted that should the amendment fail, the whole
                    government must fall into secessionists' hands in the next election.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This amendment was much less than the suffrage that Stevens desired, but he was practical enough to
                    be satisfied with what Sumner called a half–way measure. Fessenden, who defended the
                    proposal against the attacks of the Massachusetts senator in the other house, admitted that the

            <p>Ultra–Radicals, who still hoped for direct suffrage, worked from the beginning to kill the
                    proposed representation amendment, identical in principle with that later incorporated in the
                    Fourteenth Amendment. A number of conservative senators drifted into the opposition also, not
                    because they personally opposed it, but because evidence of a contrary public sentiment caused them
                    first to hesitate, then to take a timid stand against it. The press was generally critical from the
                    beginning. Correspondence of public men, especially from the West, contained a large volume of
                    adverse comment. Even some of Sumner's friends advised that public opinion would not allow
                    more drastic measures: "You will defeat the only constitutional measure that can be enacted
                    at this time tending to the consummation of your wishes in regard to universal

                    the Senate, voted for the measure, several Republicans voting with the opposition Democrats.
                    Fessenden lamented the loss of the representation measure, "for we can get nothing so good.

            <p>Something was needed to regain lost prestige and to rally hesitating Republicans of all faiths into a
                    solid front. Congress was being criticized for its failure to present a plan of reconstruction. All
                    it had done, said the <hi rend="i">Nation</hi>, was to report a series of measures forming no part
                    of any "well-defined plan, and not based upon any well-defined principle."<hi rend="sup">41</hi> "The people are clamoring <hi rend="i">more for a policy</hi> on
                    this subject, than they could suffer from a bad one," wrote one of Stevens'
                    correspondents. Delay in formulating such a policy seemed dangerous since the President had one
                    already before the people. "We are in the position on this subject that a party is that has
                    no candidate in the field."<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>James H. Lane of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> was quoted as saying that the Republican party could now be saved only by admitting at
                    least some states soon enough to satisfy Johnson's demands.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Many
                    alarmed voices testified to the need of compromise in order to hold the party together and of action
                    in order to hold popular support.</p>
            <p>Newspapers reflected their correspondents' observations that Radicals had begun to realize
                    the inadequacy of talk and the necessity for action. Recognition of this criticism of delay is seen
                    in the speech made by Colfax on the night of April 10. He announced that "Congress had only
                    just received all of the official documents" revealing southern conditions and was at last
                    ready to define its policy.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this point Robert Dale Owen appeared with his highly publicized plan of postponing negro suffrage
                    until 1876 and reducing southern representation prior to that date. Stevens was principally
                    impressed by the possibility of its passage. He told Owen that the required majority in Congress or
                    among the states could not be mustered for immediate negro suffrage.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Though
                    Sumner did not favor the Owen plan, he also admitted that a measure for negro suffrage could not
                    pass in 1866.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

                    <hi rend="i">Times</hi> reported that the principal division had been between those determined to
                    obtain negro suffrage and those "willing to throw the question overboard."<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Various state congressional delegations had been meeting from time to time to determine what stand on
                    public issues would be supported by their constituents. Just before the alleged differences of
                    opinion on the joint committee, such groups representing midwestern states were reported to have
                    accepted the strategy of avoiding extreme policies because they might easily bring defeat.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> Stevens told Owen that some House members had informed him they would support
                    no plan containing "a nigger in the woodpile."<hi rend="sup">50</hi> Fessenden
                    later disclosed that the "first proposition had been voted down in committee because it was
                    thought that Congress and the people of the Western States would not accept it."<hi rend="sup">51</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The influence of these meetings is further suggested by the instance of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> delegation which met and came to certain conclusions as to what was safe as an election
                    platform. Roscoe Conkling and Wiley P. Harris of the joint committee, which had not then agreed on
                    any plan, were of this group. The delegation endorsed a constitutional amendment reducing
                    representation in proportion to denial of the suffrage to any class, prohibiting payment of the
                    rebel debt or compensation for emancipated slaves, and excluding from federal office all high
                    officials of the Confederacy and those convicted of mistreating prisoners.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> A
                    comparison of these points with those included in the Fourteenth Amendment seems to indicate more
                    than coincidence.</p>
            <p>A complete change of the amendment formerly agreed upon took place on April 28. Stevens told Owen

                    importance as a condition of reconstruction. It is indeed interesting that on the same day that the
                    committee dropped all ideas of enforced negro suffrage, it also agreed to make restoration
                    permissible, instead of compulsory, by substituting "may" for
                    "shall" in a proposed restoration bill. At the same time, the committee rejected a
                    motion to make its present recommendation the sole condition of restoration.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>
                    Apparently the dominant group had decided on a program of delay, rather than of surrender, on the
                    issue of suffrage.</p>
            <p>The amendment was certainly no victory for anyone, least of all the Radicals. James W. Grimes, who
                    represented a view similar to that of Fessenden, confessed that though acceptable, it was
                    "not exactly what any of us anted. "<hi rend="sup">56</hi> How well the committee
                    had achieved compromise is evidenced by the results of unofficial polls and the analysis of
                    political observers. Some disappointment is revealed; nevertheless, also evident was a general
                    willingness to accept the proposition as reported.</p>
            <p>Even Sumner seemed inclined to support it.<hi rend="sup">57</hi> Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase,
                    radical as he had been on many points including negro suffrage, took a rather conservative view and
                    gave it general approval, although he thought that "overloading the ship with amendment
                    freight" was a mistake.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> A part of the Radical press expressed
                    unenthusiastic support, but lamented that timid souls had exercised too much influence. Stevens
                    himself was criticized for willingness to sacrifice principle for public support. Certain it is that
                    the amendment was far from the real objective of Stevens in regard to reconstruction. Apparently the
                    spectre of defeat in the approaching elections inspired unwonted timidity in the minds of many
                    important Radicals.</p>

            <p>Fessenden did not claim unusual virtues for the amendment but thought it the best that could be
                    agreed upon and still be acceptable to the people. These considerations had been deemed the most

                    friends and so few enemies that it might be considered "feeble." The only reason
                    for accepting such a document would be "fear of doing worse and an unwillingness to
                    dissolve Congress and go to the people without some tangible scheme of a restoration of the whole
                        Union."<hi rend="sup">63</hi> Press comment very generally recognized that the
                    discarding of Radical dogma indicated that political necessity had dictated compromise.</p>
            <p>Years later Carl Schurz wrote, with the wisdom of hindsight, that although there had appeared to be
                    danger to the party, perhaps it had not been as great as most had thought. According to Schurz,
                    Radicals believed that political defeat would ruin all chances of realizing their program.
                    Consequently, the amendment had been devised as a compromise, a "mere expedient"
                    in order to save themselves and press toward their real goal when it seemed more attainable.<hi rend="sup">64</hi>

            <p>Stevens, in opening the debate in the House, confessed that the amendment fell far short of his and
                    the committee's wishes. "I believe it is all that can be obtained in the present
                    state of public opinion," he added. After carefully surveying the whole situation,
                    "we did not believe that nineteen of the loyal states could be induced to ratify any
                    proposition more stringent than this." Because of the earlier defeat of the proposed

                    These statements are somewhat official, for Stevens, the leader of the House representation on the
                    committee, read them in one of the few written speeches ever delivered by that grim old Radical.</p>
            <p>The section of the proposed Fourteenth Amendment disfranchising ex-Confederates drew most of the
                    attacking fire. This, it was feared, would appear too partisan and would ruin all hope of
                    ratification. How important the section in question was to Radical leadership is demonstrated by
                    Stevens' angry words in closing the debate: Without this provision "that side of
                    the House will be filled with yelling secessionists and hissing copperheads. Give us the third
                    section or give us nothing," he challenged.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> Although the section
                    passed the House, it was killed in the Senate.</p>
            <p>As much modified as the amendment now had been in the direction of less radical measures, many
                    constituents urged Republican senators to vote down the proposal before it brought them defeat at
                    the polls. A member of the Central Committee of the Union Party in <placeName>

                    northern states would. The next presidency would be lost if this amendment were insisted upon, wrote

            </p>
            <p>Political leaders who predicted alteration of the amendment in the Senate knew whereof they spoke: An
                    informal caucus agreed to strike the disfranchising section and to substitute a provision
                    disqualifying ex-Confederate leaders from public office<hi rend="sup">68</hi>—a much
                    milder measure.</p>
            <p>Senator Howard, who took charge of the amendment in the Senate, clearly stated that he and others of
                    the committee had preferred negro suffrage but that it was really a question of what could be
                    ratified. The <placeName>

                    committee, be induced to ratify a suffrage proposal. He did not support the disfranchising section,
                    and advised its deletion which the caucus was supposed to have already approved.<hi rend="sup">69</hi>

            <p>In another party meeting, Sherman's proposals to amend in order to meet Johnson's
                    objections were seriously considered for long hours.<hi rend="sup">70</hi> One newspaper
                    correspondent wrote of hearing "strong talk on the part of members of the necessity of

            </p>
            <p>Finally, having spent a large part of three days in party discussions, the Republican majority
                    emerged, bound by party pledges, to support caucus measures and to reject all others. Even so, the
                    final majority was only three more than the required two-thirds.</p>
            <p>In asking the House to approve the Senate changes, Stevens emphasized that great haste had been
                    necessary to prevent the overwhelming of loyal men in Congress by secessionists. He urged his
                    listeners to be satisfied with what was obtainable in order to prevent the demoralization of the
                        party.<hi rend="sup">72</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The committee report, showing the need for the amendment, had not been presented to Congress prior to
                    its acceptance of the amendment. It was not written for Congressional consumption but was admittedly
                    designed to serve political purposes. Its campaign value was recognized by all. The <hi rend="i">Nation</hi> termed it "an able state paper drawn up with the consciousness that upon
                    it a great party must take its stand, and that upon its reasoning Congress must depend to maintain

            <p>As further evidence that dominant politicians were absorbed in their purpose to win the approaching

                    guarantees, a few outstanding cases may be cited. Despite strong pressure of a political nature, no
                    move to promise restoration was made. All bills to pledge this had been shelved as soon as a Senate
                    substitution for the third section made ratification possible as the sole condition of readmission.</p>

                    were framed with a purely political purpose; winning the election, not restoring the Union seemed
                    the dominant object.</p>
            <p>Though the admission of <placeName>

                    </placeName> delegates implied that general readmission would follow ratification, most leaders of
                    Congress spoke of the amendment as a condition of restoration, but not necessarily the final terms
                    of Congress. Stevens, Sumner, and others carefully avoided such statements. Leading journals
                    gradually shifted from expectation of reunion to admission that Congress was not bound to recognize
                    southern states on ratification of the amendment.</p>
            <p>By the next year, after the elections of 1866, these same leaders were saying that, had the states
                    ratified immediately, they most certainly would have been admitted. In 1866 Howard of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> had definitely repudiated any implied promise;<hi rend="sup">75</hi> but the next
                    summer, when drastic reconstruction measures were being adopted, he stated that, had the amendment
                    been ratified, "the rebel states would today have been represented in
                        Congress."<hi rend="sup">76</hi> James G. Blaine is another good example of this
                    change-about for political reasons. In later years he wrote that, had the South ratified in 1867, it
                    would have been immediately restored; but in 1866 he had said that the elections "have not
                    determined that the privilege of representation shall be given those states as an immediate
                    consequence of adopting the amendment." He testified that the measure to readmit on this
                    single condition had been "absolutely kicked under the table in both branches" and
                    that the joint committee had helped to dispose of it.<hi rend="sup">77</hi> Stevens, with his usual
                    practical political view, recognized that a difference of opinion on this point existed in the party
                    in 1866; and he preferred to avoid it. "Why distract the party?" was his
                        attitude.<hi rend="sup">78</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no question but that ultra-Radicals did not desire ratification. Nor is there any question
                    that they would have opposed admission on this condition alone. They still <list type="footnotes">

                    They openly proclaimed that the amendment did not go far enough. Nevertheless, if the election could
                    be won with it as a platform, they might then interpret the confused campaign issues as a mandate to
                    proceed as they desired. This they did, using southern rejection to clinch the argument.</p>
            <p>Although several purposes can be clearly seen in early proposals for a Fourteenth Amendment, the
                    finished product found most of these either compromised or lost in the necessity of framing
                    something which all could approve. The most important purpose in the minds of most framers and
                    members of the Republican party in Congress was undoubtedly that the amendment might furnish a
                    popular platform in the political campaign of 1866. That was the immediate aim, and politicians
                    traditionally have been willing to risk ultimate hopes for present advantage.</p>

            <p>The <hi rend="i">Prehistory Research Series</hi> published by the Indiana Historical Society offers
                    as its next issue (Volume 11, Number 4) a treatise entitled <hi rend="i">Mortuary Customs of the
                        Shawnee and Other Eastern Tribes</hi>, by Mrs. Erminie Wheeler Voegelin of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Voegelin determined upon this study as a result of the discussions held at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Archaeological Conference in 1935. At these meetings the problem of tribal
                    identification of certain prehistoric sites occurred throughout the discussions. Several times the
                    Shawnee were mentioned as possible inhabitants of certain of these sites. Mrs. Voegelin had been
                    doing ethnological field work with the Shawnee in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>, and at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> conference she began to wonder if a student of present-day tribal cultures might
                    contribute data which would bear upon the identification of late prehistoric sites. Specifically,
                    would not the analysis of one feature of Shawnee culture, such as mortuary customs, if proven to
                    have a stability of its own and studied in the light of Shawnee affiliations with neighboring
                    tribes, aid in the identification of Shawnee prehistoric sites?</p>
            <p>Upon this one feature of Shawnee culture, mortuary customs, Mrs. Voegelin gathered data from
                    present-day informants and searched the literature widely for all historical references. The
                    complete accounts obtained from the informants in the field are given in an appendix. Mrs. Voegelin
                    divides her study into an analysis of the Shawnee burial complex, a study of the cultural
                    affiliations of the complex, and an intensive comparative analysis of the burial customs of
                    twenty-eight eastern North American tribes. Sixteen tables are included. From this comparative study
                    she traces the probable movements of the Shawnee in the "late" prehistoric period
                    from the northeastern Great Lakes region into the Southeast and then northward into their locations
                    at the beginning of the historical period. From ethnographic evidence she shows that the Shawnee
                    were probably not the inhabitants of the Madisonville site often attributed to them. Also, by
                    comparative study she shows that there is little evidence for relating the stone-box grave burials
                    found in such <pb n="364" id="VAA4025-039-4-048"/> quantities in the <placeName>

                    notes, and a bibliography.</p>

            <head>THE LETTERS OF GODLOVE S. ORTH, HOOSIER WHIG</head>
            <byline>Edited by J. Herman Schauinger</byline>
            <p>With the election of William Henry Harrison to the presidency in 1841, the Whig party took charge of
                    national affairs. His nomination also helped the party in Indiana, but its triumph in the nation and
                    the state was short-lived. Its connection in Indiana with internal improvements, which proved so
                    disastrous after the panic of 1837, was to return to haunt its members during the forties. The death
                    of Harrison left the national party without adequate leadership and it divided into its various
                    factions. For it was a party of compromise, made up of diverse and incompatible elements, and so was
                    destined to disintegrate and to disappear from the scene. The rise of the slavery issue and the
                    appearance of the Liberty and Free Soil parties was to hasten this disintegration.</p>
            <p>Much has been written about the Whig party in the national arena, but comparatively little about its
                    activity in various states. Often national careers began in state politics, and some were terminated
                    by the concurrence of leaders in the various states, who, although not known in national circles,
                    were important political figures at home.</p>
            <p>The letters of Godlove S. Orth in the period of the 1840's illustrate these points. The
                    letter of August 16, 1845, contains an interesting description of the differences among Indiana
                    Whigs. Other letters reveal the seriousness of the internal improvement issue. Orth's
                    distrust of General Zachary Taylor is also clearly stated, and finally the discouragement caused by
                    frequent defeat and the appearance of the Liberty party is evident. This correspondence is essential
                    to any study of the Whigs of this state, for it reveals some of the backstage events of Hoosier
                    politics of the period.</p>
            <p>They are not without significance in understanding national events. With the approach of the
                    presidential election of 1848, the attention of the state politicians was drawn in this direction
                    and the virtues and deficiencies of Henry <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>, Zachary Taylor, Winfield Scott, and other leaders were discussed.</p>
            <p>Godlove S. Orth was born on April 22, 1817, at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lebanon</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>. In 1839
                    he came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, where <pb n="366" id="VAA4025-039-4-050"/> he was admitted to the bar. He was
                    taken under the wing of Judge John Pettit, who made him his protégé and
                    partner. Orth entered politics in 1840, stumping the state for Harrison. He was in the state senate
                    from 1843 to 1848 and in 1845 was president of that body. His name was presented for the
                    governorship in 1846, but he withdrew in favor of Joseph G. Marshall.</p>
            <p>After the Compromise measures of 1850 he joined other parties, until finally he helped organize the
                    Republican party in Indiana. The story of this phase of his career will be told in the second group
                    of letters which will appear later. Orth was elected to the 38th Congress in 1862 and served
                    continuously through the 41st Congress. He gradually joined the extreme Radicals and voted for the
                    most stringent reconstruction bills. In March, 1875, he was appointed minister to <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="au">Austria</region>-<country reg="hu">Hungary</country>
               </placeName>,
                    holding this position until May, 1876. He resigned to accept the nomination for governor, but again
                    withdrew, this time in favor of Benjamin Harrison. He died December 16, 1882.</p>
            <p>The recipient of most of these letters, Schuyler Colfax, was born in <placeName>

                    also took an active part in forming the Republican party in Indiana. He was in Congress from the
                    34th to the 40th session and in the last three was speaker of the house. He was nominated for the
                    vice-presidency in 1868. He became involved in the scandals of the Grant administration,
                    particularly in the Credit Mobilier scandal.</p>

                                    as Sample<hi rend="sup">2</hi> is beaten, and in a District that has the strength to
                                    support him.</p>
                        <p>My first prediction has been verified—and the result of this election,
                                    more than ever, strengthens my belief in my other prophecies. Indiana is a Whig
                                    State—and by proper and well directed effort, we shall be able to elect
                                    our candidate for Governor next summer.</p>
                        <p>To accomplish this much depends upon the course of the Whig's members of the
                                    Legislature next session, and of the Whig editors during the campaign. In the first
                                    place we want no "Legislative address". These addresses do no good
                                    whatever, and are pregnant with evil. They are used, in garbled extracts, by our
                                    opponents, to mislead and deceive the ignorant and unwary, the sentiments that may
                                    accord with one section of the State, are obnoxious in another.</p>
                        <p>In this State, we have various phases of public opinion; the enterprising Yankee of
                                    Northern Indiana, despises the sluggish and inaminate North Carolinian, Virginian,
                                    and Kentuckian in the Southern part of the State, while the latter in return,
                                    regarding the "patriarchal institution" as the direct gift of God
                                    to man, looks upon the freeman who toils with his own hands and proclaims a belief
                                    in the patriotic sentiments of his fathers, as a fanatic and a fool. So on the
                                    question of State policy, one section is Improvement, the other Anti—one
                                    portion is willing and able to submit to a taxation sufficient to redeem our ruined
                                    credit—another portion, who have no avenue to market for their produce,
                                    will not yet submit to anything of the kind. In fact they are unable to bear their

                                    battling to raise public opinion to its level, we must come down a little, slacken
                                    the stern rule when necessary, meet public opinion, even if only midway at the
                                    desired goal—in a word, we must "stoop to conquer".
                                    This, I confess, is not, high-strung Whig doctrine, but the rising generation of
                                    young &amp; ardent Whigs, if ever they desire to participate in the honors and
                                    emoluments of their country, must deviate, for a time at least from the track, so
                                    often trod, and that so inevitably leads to defeat. Look at the campaign of
                                    '40, straight-laced Whiggery could not have excited a single throb of noble
                                    enthusiasm in the breasts of the people, but old things &amp; old politicians
                                    were either laid aside, or compelled to follow in the wake of a new sect or species

                                    to express no preference until about the first of December—and then go it
                                    strong. If you find him favorably inclined I should be pleased to see him adopt this
                                    course. Has he written to you yet—</p>
                        <p>I cannot see how I can get along without you at the Capitol this winter—at
                                    least not unless the prospect is more favorable than at present—I suppose
                                    one or two of my Pennsylvanian friends (Hapi[?] or Koehler) would consent to attend
                                    the Convention as delegates from your County. However faithful they would be, still
                                    they are unversed in party machinery—and you may still be needed there,
                                    in the event that I cannot by the 1st January assure you that
                                    "all's well"—</p>
                        <p>I shall go to Inds about the 20th of next month—and shall to the utmost of
                                    my ingenuity, make every possible interest turn to my advantage. The <hi rend="i">ruffles</hi> you may rest assured will be "doffed" and to

                        <salute>Dear Schuyler,</salute>
                        <p>I write in much haste, in the midst of professional and family engagements incident
                                    to my departure for the Capitol.</p>
                        <p>I shall leave in two or three days—and if anything can be gathered at that
                                    focus I shall apprize you of it fully.</p>
                        <p>The "Journal" there, acts a prudent part in not siding with any
                                    particular individual—tho' I learn, sub rosa, that J. D. D.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> is in favor of Johnson Watts.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> I think
                                    however there is nothing to fear in that quarter.</p>
                        <p>Judge McDonald was the most formidable man yet named—but his positive
                                    declination smooths matters there.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>H. S. Lane while attending Court here two weeks ago, assured both my friends
                                    &amp; myself that he would go for me decidedly—A. S. White will not
                                    consent to the use of his name at all.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> So that the field at
                                    present looks quite clear, if old Watts does not stir up better than I anticipate.</p>
                        <p>Barnett, in a recent letter, pledges himself to go for me all lengths, but advises me
                                    by no means to be a candidate—talks about defeat, broken down politicians
                                    etc etc—He is soured &amp; disappointed &amp; has some reason to
                                    feel so.</p>
                        <p>Col. Sands writes to me very encouragingly &amp; says that my name takes well
                                    there and believes the whole <hi rend="i">pocket</hi> will go for
                                    me—promises to be active etc.</p>
                        <p>Looking over the whole pond I am inclined to believe every thing looks as fair as
                                    could be expected. The first act in the drama has thus far been well
                                    played—a favorable impression, without dictation, has been produced.</p>
                        <p>Now for the second—County Conventions are called in many of the Counties
                                    and what part should my friends take—Have delegates
                                    instructed?—or merely see that the right men are appointed. I prefer the
                                    latter and so advised Grubbs &amp; others. Instructions may produce
                                    heartburnings and difficulties—two or three prominent Whig Counties
                                    should pass <hi rend="i">complimentary</hi> resolutions and might, perhaps, express
                                    a mere preference without positive instructions.</p>
                        <p>The adjoining Counties, so far as I have learned, including White Co. will go for me
                                    in the Convention.</p>

                        <salute>(Colfax) My Dear Sir,</salute>
                        <p>Friend Grant handed me your welcome letter this morning. He arrived here in good
                                    health, though the prospects of his election are rather gloomy. I am sorry it is so.
                                    He is a fine young man and I shall do all in my power to elect him.</p>
                        <p>I arrived here five or six days since and am intently engaged in surveying the
                                    political world as exhibited in this metropolis. The Locos<hi rend="sup">17</hi> are
                                    in trouble—domestic dissensions are rife and threaten to make serious
                                    inroads upon the hitherto unterrified Democracy. It seems to be admitted that
                                    Whitcomb cannot be elected U.S.S. without the aid of Whig votes—which God
                                    forbid! By prudence we may profit by their follies.</p>
                        <p>The "old hunkers"<hi rend="sup">18</hi> among the Whigs are in a
                                    perfect quandary—their announcement of old Col Watts, has failed to meet
                                    with the responsz they fondly anticipated—the truth is, every sensible
                                    man cannot but regard his nomination as the precursor of certain
                                    defeat—his own friends admit that he cannot canvass the State, and a
                                    silent campaign will produce nothing but disaster. On this subject the Whig press
                                    should speak out at once, boldly and fearlessly—there is no time to
                                    lose—and my word on it the people will sanction your course. It is
                                    admitted here now that the contest lies between the Col &amp;
                                    myself—and much of course will depend upon the prompt and energetic
                                    action of my friends.</p>
                        <p>You mention Watts connection with the order of Masons as likely to injure his
                                    election. You must mention this matter carefully. Their ramifications extend to all
                                    portions of community and they are jealous of the peculiar rights and privileges of

                        <p>Defrees has as yet spoken to me but twice—he appears cool &amp;
                                    distant, and no doubt "ill at ease". A highminded impartial paper
                                    here, would desire to do ample justice between all the rival candidates, yet he has
                                    had scarcely the magnamity to notice my name in his columns and he no doubt feels he
                                    has done me wrong. Your letter to Farquhan has done some good—the idea
                                    that Watts cannot carry St. Joe—troubles them awfully. <hi rend="i">But F

                        <salute>My dear Colfax—</salute>
                        <p>I should long since have answered your last—and censure myself for this
                                    seeming negligence on my part. But the excitement incident to the eleclion of U.S.
                                        Senator<hi rend="sup">22</hi> and the subsequent unlooked excitement attendant
                                    upon the election of President of the Senate entirely unhinged my mind &amp;
                                    rendered it almost unfit for anything like epsistolary correspondence. You have
                                    learned the result of both elections. In the latter the Whigs did
                                    wrong—we ought never to have submitted to any compromise whatever. the
                                    Locos had voluntarily vacated the Chair &amp; we were under no obligation to
                                    fill it for them. I advised, entreated, and urged the Whig Senators to stand firm,
                                    if need be, until the first Monday in August next. 23 good &amp; true men stood
                                    by my side, under <hi rend="i">written pledge</hi> to that effect, but one faltered,
                                    Henry of <placeName>
                                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                                    </placeName>, who ought to have been the last man to falter, if he had suffered his
                                    memory to go back a year or two.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus situated we were compelled in order to avoid ineffable disgrace, to effect a
                                    compromise by which I am to retain the chair until the last week of the Session and
                                    then to vacate in favor of a Loco. This is mortifying, but after the stand we had
                                    taken it is perhaps better than to have permitted the election of a Loco.</p>

                        <p>The position thus assigned me will be no detriment, as I imagine, to my prospects in

                        <p>The time is drawing rapidly towards the 9th and when I contemplate the great
                                    responsibility which I must assume in the event of my nomination—my heart
                                    fails within me. I fear I have not the experience, ability and force of character
                                    sufficient to carry me through the canvass, and if I fail the party may be stranded
                                    for years in this state, and myself (which however is comparatively a small
                                    consideration) doomed to a political death—beyond the hope of a
                                    resurrection—but things have gone too far and it would be more difficult
                                    now to retract my steps that to press forward to the goal.</p>
                        <p>In my intercourse I am very reserved on the question of nomination—though
                                    my name is hourly—and frequently in my hearing named in such
                                    connection—I never speak of it unless it is broached by others and then I
                                    treat the matter with indifference, except among my personal friends.</p>

                                    decidedly on the decline. And their only hope now is (I think) to persuade Joe

                        <p>Should Marshall be here &amp; agree to accept of the nomination I will not suffer
                                    my name to go before the Convention—it would be presumption in me to do

                                    conference between Defrees &amp; myself did not amount to much—the
                                    first offer was to run on the ticket with Watts, which I promptly &amp;
                                    positively rejected—the second was that I should go on the ticket with
                                    Dunn—to which I replied that Dunn might with <hi rend="i">more
                                    propriety</hi> go on the ticket with me—the third offer was to go on the

                                    &amp; that Marshall would pledge himself to canvass the state. I told him (D)
                                    that I would not canvass the State for any man but myself at least not without

                                    most cordially assented, and thus ended the conference.</p>
                        <p>The truth is, D. is against me—but thank God—he is
                                    powerless—even his position, which ought to give him a great influence,
                                    is being regarded here by many good Whigs, as an unfortunate one for the party.</p>

                                    prevented me writing to you as soon as I had promised.</p>
                        <p>I reached home a few days since and am now in the bosom of my family enjoying a
                                    felicity that is broken only by the thought that I must ere long leave Home
                                    &amp; its endearments to mingle in the angry and exciting scenes of a heated
                                    political canvass.</p>
                        <p>I heartily wish myself out of it, and to remain a private Citizen but destiny seems
                                    to point to a different course of life and I must obey. You may regard this as
                                    merely moralizing, but these thoughts I assure are prompted by r,he circumstances
                                    that now surround me. Wife, boy, &amp; all the endearments of the Family

                                    contest—our policy is to effect an indifference in the presence of the
                                    enemy and to prevent an undue excitement, while at the same time it becomes us to
                                    watch well the work of organization. County, township, &amp; school district

                                            interests. He made certain proposals to the General Assembly which were
                                            turned down by that body. The final action of the Assembly was not very
                                            creditable, as it tried to evade the question. After a struggle, a bill was
                                            passed, but it was carelessly drawn and impossible to execute. No bonds were

                                    will require labor, but the result will amply repay us. For we cannot disguise the
                                    fact that a majority of the voters of Ind are against us, especially on general
                                    policy. And this brings me to say that we must avoid as much as possible all merely
                                    national politics. Whitcomb's course on the Judiciary—his
                                    neglect of the interests of education—his noncommittal course on all
                                    questions of importance, &amp;c &amp;c must be rung loud &amp; long
                                    throughout the campaign.</p>

                                    especially along the line of the W. &amp; E. Canal—and I fear it will
                                    enure to Whitcomb's benefit. I voted against the bill for various reasons,
                                    but mainly because it does not provide sufficiently for the adjustment of our
                                    Indebtedness. Rut should the people take it into their heads (and Whit. will use his
                                    utmost endeavors) to believe that it is a "plan" for the payment
                                    of our debt, it must strengthen him—for he claims all the credit of the
                                    paternity of the measure. Write to me fully on the subject. I feared
                                    this—and so told the Whigs in the Leg., but the advice was not heeded. If
                                    nothing had been done this winter, what an awful reckoning had there been against W.
                                    I may be wrong, but I should like to know how to tack on this question. We dare not
                                    oppose the bill now because 1st it is the law of the land—and 2nd a
                                    majority of the votes in favor of the bill are Whigs!</p>
                        <p>If anything beats us, it will be this measure, though it may possibly turn out
                                    differently &amp; doom to oblivion the prime movers of the plan. These
                                    people—are queer sort of folks—At all events I think the Whig
                                    papers had better not laud the measure too highly.</p>
                        <p>I shall canvass the State generally &amp; shall spend the last 3 weeks of the

                        <p>Joe Marshall is a strong team and he goes into the canvass with strong hopes and a

                                    thorough organization. This <pb n="380" id="VAA4025-039-4-064"/> is all important
                                    and I trust you will see it carried out in your region of the State.</p>
                        <p>Something considerable can be made in those counties where the majority is largely
                                    against us, as in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                                    </placeName>—by not running a ticket for the Legislature—and
                                    inducing rival loco candidates which can easily be done. Last year in Carroll Co
                                    Holmes made 175 votes by this management.</p>
                        <p>Another thing I wish you to impress upon the Whigs through the State &amp; that
                                    is to bring our County tickets out as early as possible. It will save much hard
                                    feeling &amp; the people now readily acquiese in the nominations—it
                                    will also prevent so many aspirants, &amp;c but you can at a moment see this
                                    advantage.</p>
                        <p>An editorial on this subject might do good. It is best to say but little about
                                    Whitcomb until June or July—&amp; then to open rich—the
                                    materials will be furnished. It might not be amiss after a while to tell the folks
                                    that Joe Marshall had a considerable patrimony in <hi rend="i">slaves</hi> left
                                    him—all of whom he has emancipated &amp; provided for in this State.
                                    But I have scribbled about enough.</p>
                        <p>The State Convention went off very well &amp; had Joe M. refused the nomination
                                    friend Watts &amp; myself would have had the field alone &amp; the result
                                    you can easily guess. But it is better as it is—and if successful now an
                                    apprenticeship of 3 years will convince the people that I am the very man they want
                                    after Joe….</p>

                        <salute>Dear Sir.</salute>
                        <p>I herewith decline a canvass for the office of Lieut, Governor.</p>
                        <p>The success of our principles, in which I feel a deep and abiding interest, as well
                                    as justice to myself, demand of me the step I have taken.</p>
                        <p>My sincere regret for the course that circumstances have compelled me to adopt, is
                                    much alleviated by the reflection, that the Party may find an abler man to fill my
                                    place, and one who will concentrate upon himself its ENTIRE
                                strength….</p>

                        <salute>Dear Colfax</salute>
                        <p>Your welcome letter has this moment been received.</p>
                        <p>I claim the credit for having <hi rend="i">first thought</hi> of your name in
                                    connection with the office of State Auditor.</p>
                        <p>So soon as it was known here how the Legislature stood I fixed upon you in my minds
                                    eye as the man to fill that place—for many very many reasons.</p>
                        <p>I know you are sufficiently qualified—you are deserving of the station,
                                    2nd we want a good &amp; prudent Whig at the Capitol—to
                                    watch—to plan—to mature and to execute the purposes of the
                                    Whig party.</p>
                        <p>I go for you with all my might &amp; soul &amp; shall spare no exertions
                                    between this &amp; the meeting of the Legislature to accomplish so desirable a
                                    result to me as your election. Correspond freely with your friends. I shall do the

                        <p>But you must not urge Stanfield too strongly, better not at all<hi rend="sup">34</hi>—his election might &amp; no doubt would prove fatal to you.</p>
                        <p>It would be used against you. But Stanfield cannot be elected Speaker.</p>
                        <p>He is much of a gentleman &amp; very clever. But his Knowledge of parliamentary
                                    rules is too limited as well as his acquaintance with the members &amp;
                                    throughout the State generally—to ensure success.</p>
                        <p>But this Auditor matter I am right after &amp; shall use what little influence I

                        <salute>My dear Colfax—</salute>
                        <p>I am almost ashamed to appear before you for my long silence indicates neglect
                                    &amp; almost utter forgetfulness. I can only say "strike but
                                    hear!" The truth is, the full terms of our Court—and an office
                                    full of neglected business, the result of my late campaign—have pressed
                                    and still press so heavily upon me—that I am compelled to postpone the
                                    claim of private friendship to the more urgent call of professional duty. I have
                                    however not neglected your interests if I have been remiss in answering your ever
                                    welcome letters. I have written to Holloway, Ellis, Davis, <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>

                                    I also wrote a long letter to Collins of New <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                                    </placeName> (in reply). He is a candidate for Treasurer, and I think is likely to
                                    be a successful one. I pressed upon him the advantage of a Union between the North
                                    &amp; South in the election of Treasurer &amp; Auditor, told him if his
                                    forces were united with yours they would be formidable—and by harmonious
                                    action might prove successful.</p>
                        <p>But the battle is to be fought at the Capitol. Members do not like to pledge
                                    themselves by letter. When once on the ground I can tell in two days how the land
                                    lies. I shall be at <placeName>

                                    keeping aloof from cliques &amp; bargains, shall do all in my power to secure
                                    your election. But if the signs are unpropitious and there is no possibility of your
                                    election my advice to you will be not to suffer your name to be <list type="footnotes">

                        <p>I would have written to you two weeks since but after so long silence &amp; so
                                    much neglect on my part I could not, until the present moment, command moral courage
                                    sufficient to introduce myself in your presence. Before I left home I was engaged
                                    upwards of two months in attending our Courts &amp; therefore deferred writing
                                    until I should reach the Capitol. When I got here a press of business in the Supreme
                                    Court made me again defer until the meeting of the Legislature when another
                                    postponement took place. All of which actings and doings have fully convinced me of
                                    the truth of the apothegm that "delays are dangerous." Although
                                    negligent in my correspondence I had not forgotten you &amp; stood ready at any
                                    moment in connection with your friend Stanfield, to urge your name &amp; claims
                                    to the office of State Auditor. Tom no doubt has written you fully on this subject.
                                    At your request we did not present your name to the Whig caucus, but determined
                                    among ourselves &amp; a few other choice friends—to await the result
                                    of the caucus—and if the party could not rally on their candidate, in
                                    joint convention, to throw out your name, roll up our sleeves, engage in the general
                                    melee—and trust to <placeName>

                                    these reasons—</p>
                        <p>1st Douglas Maguire (who is a whole souled faithful soldier in our course, and who
                                    tho' often defeated, has never thrown away his musket or deserted our

                                    from about 46 members, being a majority of the Whigs—the other Whigs were
                                    either in favor of G. P. R. Wilson or else indifferent. The result was that Maguire
                                    could not be defeated in caucus.</p>
                        <p>2nd The friends of Hamick of <placeName>

                                    Maguire—4 nothing could be done with them &amp; in consequence the
                                    friends of Collins of New <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                                    </placeName> for fear of incurring the displeasure of Maguire's friends
                                    dare not form any coalition, and their desire to keep Wilson's friends from
                                    going against him preventing any coalition in that quarter.</p>
                        <p>3rd I was so situated personally, as to be compelled to go for Biddle my full
                                        length.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> Biddle is my warm personal friend—and
                                    soon after the August election made an appeal to me which I dare not
                                    resist—and on the other hand Wright was supported by my most bitter
                                    enemies and his election would have interfered very sensibly with my practice in
                                    White, <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Jasper</region>
                                    </placeName>, &amp; Carroll Counties which are in his circuit. If any other
                                    person, but Riddle, had been a candidate against Wright I could have made a heavy
                                    draught on his friends. So you see there was no earthly chance of doing anything
                                    only in the event of breaking up the caucus arrangement, and that was a very
                                    hazardous attempt—as it might have elected all the Locos, a result that
                                    would have been fraught with incalcuable mischief to our party. As it
                                    is—we present to our constituents an undivided front, besides electing
                                    most excellent men.</p>
                        <p>I should have preferred the election of Collins to that of Haman. Collins would have
                                    been an active &amp; efficient aid at the Capital.</p>
                        <p>Defrees is in danger. The Locos are determined to put the printing to the lowest
                                    bidder &amp; a few <hi rend="i">soft</hi> Whigs are going with them.</p>
                        <p>Semans is also a candidate &amp; <hi rend="i">strange to say</hi>, will not
                                    submit his claims to a Whig caucus. He holds out because the Locos have promised to
                                    go for him in case they cannot elect Chapman.</p>
                        <p>It would he a severe blow to Defrees personally as well as to the party to have the
                                    printing confined to Loco hands.</p>
                        <p>In the way of legislation there is as yet nothing of special importance. The <placeName>

                                    bonds—and if ever it becomes a law will deprive the state from even

                        <salute>Dear Colfax—</salute>
                        <p>The Dispenser of all Good no doubt punishes all transgressions. Since my return from
                                    the Capitol and indeed while there I most shamefully neglected my friends. I have
                                    not written a letter for two weeks, except on business, but today, having the hand
                                    of sickness heavily upon me—in the shape of a severe cold—I
                                    snatch a few hours, from the taking of medicine &amp;c to devote to my
                                    friends—and consequently shall be able to scrawl <hi rend="i">some</hi>
                                    half dozen of letters.</p>
                        <p>The session this winter was very exciting and to me very
                                    unpleasant—parties were not only divided according to the old landmarks
                                    of Whigs &amp; Locofoc—but to this was added, in increased bitterness
                                    and asperity the line of "<placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                                    </placeName> &amp; Anti-<placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                                    </placeName>."</p>
                        <p>So far as our duty as Whigs devolved upon us, we discharged it faithfully, honestly
                                    and efficiently, electing Whigs, good and true, to every office—thus
                                    giving an earnest to the Whigs of the State that union, harmony and perserverance
                                    will always enable us to accomplish much if not, an entire
                                    revolution—while to our brethen throughout the Union it speaks in a voice
                                    of encouragement and comfort preparatory to the great contest of 1848.</p>
                        <p>The Presidential Election of 1848 is destined in my estimation to be one of exceeding
                                    interest and will be fought with an energy bordering on desperation. I hope to God
                                    it will be the last struggle of Locofocoism for ascendency in this Government. And
                                    upon a calm survey of the issues that must necessarily enter largely—yes
                                    almost exclusively into that campaign—I cannot but come to the conclusion
                                    that the result will be crowned with victory to the Whigs. Victory once
                                    obtained—a good man placed at the head of government—our
                                    principles diffused into the operation of every department of that
                                    government—and that victory will secure a permanent establishment of the
                                    Whig policy. By that victory we satisfy the great mass of the people &amp; we
                                    destroy the charm of our opponents which gives them SO much power, the
                                    "cohesive power of public plunder." That charm once broken the
                                    scattered remnants of Locofocoism can never be gathered and mustered into a
                                    respectable minority—much less a party that with the advocacy of their
                                    present principles can ever hope to attain power.</p>
                        <p>This matter is well Known to their leaders, and they dread a discomfiture in the
                                    Presidential Election.</p>
                        <p>They may lose State after State—but until this opposition is properly
                                    concentrated and brought to bear upon the general election of the whole
                                    country—the immense patronage of the Gov. will give them strength
                                    &amp; energy. To combine this local and scattered strength of <pb n="385" id="VAA4025-039-4-069"/> the Whigs, we must lay aside local
                                    prejudices—overcome local influences and unite upon some distinguished
                                    individual to whom every part &amp; portion of our extended Country can point
                                    with confidence &amp; exclaim "This is our man!" With such a
                                    feeling, cheered on by an enthusiasm the legitimate result of the advocacy of a good
                                    cause—we must &amp; will succeed. But I shall tire you.</p>

                                    patriotism. I will not talk about this new bill. I regard it as even worse, far
                                    worse than the old. The grand objection to all this <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                                    </placeName> arrangement, with me is this—that it contemplates only a
                                    partial settlement of our debt—and cripples us as to the balance. This
                                    new Bill however obviates that difficulty by repudiating in plain language all the
                                    bonds that cannot or do not come into this arrangement. <hi rend="i">This is most

                        <p>You have no doubt observed the furious attacks of Maj Semans—on me, since
                                    my return. To an unsuspecting individual who had not a peep behind the curtain, it
                                    would seem that the valiant major's rantings were the spontaneous outbursts
                                    of pure patriotism. The contrary is the truth and if he persists in his course much
                                    longer I shall pull the veil of sanctified hypocrisy from him &amp; expose his
                                    naked deformities to public gaze. Here, where we are both known his assaults fall
                                    harmless to the ground. At a distance the effect is doubtless otherwise.</p>
                        <p>He has hated me for several years—and this winter a new cause of dislike
                                    was created. He was a candidate for State Printer. Knowing that a majority (yes
                                    nearly all) of the Whigs preferred Defrees, he refused to go into
                                    caucus—but threw himself into the arms of the Locofoco's and
                                    wished to use my colleague &amp; myself as tools in his hands to distract the
                                    Whig party &amp; consummate his corrupt intrigues. I refused and hence his
                                    course. Again, if the Bondholders accept the law, they will have a snug little
                                    office (the Receiver of tolls at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>

                                    has been promised the Major for his "Patriotic" exertions in their
                                    behalf. How does Bro: Stanfield like to be branded as a deserter because forsooth he
                                    happened (along with some dozen of us) to leave the Capital a few days prior to
                                    adjournment. A thing as common an occurrence as the annual session.</p>
                        <p>Will Standfield be a candidate for re-election? He makes a useful member. And is one
                                    of the most clever and social men with whom I have ever been acquainted. I likewise
                                    formed a favorable opinion of Capt Day your Senator. Bating his Locofocoism he has
                                    much of the milk of human kindness in his composition.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Colfax—</salute>
                        <p>I was pleased to receive your last and shall cheerfully comply with your request.
                                    First, 2s to Maj. Semans—His ravings have not disturbed me, nor have they
                                    produced the least ruffling in the smooth waters of Tippecance. Here he is known and
                                    duly appreciated—and his Quixotic assaults are perfectly harmless. I make
                                    no effort whatever to conciliate his good will, because I do not need
                                    it—when I do, I can, as on former occasions either buy, or drive, him to
                                    my support. His paper is just on the verge, the mere outskirts of the Whig party,
                                    and in this County and Congressional District he has no influence to wield either
                                    for or against us and our principles. With none of the intellect or shrewdness of
                                    Greely, he is devotedly attached to all his (Greely's) crotchets and
                                    believes that Fourierism, Magnetism, Witchcraft, etc. etc. are the acme of social
                                    and intellectual attainment.</p>
                        <p>As to the new Whig paper, we are determined to have one ere long. A Mr. Hull of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> is here now and negotiating for the purchase of the Journal office. If
                                    he fails in this I think he will receive sufficient assurances to enable him to
                                    commence a newspaper.</p>
                        <p>You ask my opinion of the Hero of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Buena Vista</settlement>
                                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> I regard him as a very clever good sort of a
                                    man, without any of that pre-eminent talent called Genius, but possessed of strong
                                    common sense—an iron will that "scoffs at the yoke of
                                    rule," and a heart fearless and brave. I have somewhat studied and compared
                                    his military movements (tho' I do not profess to be as well versed in
                                    Military matters as the late Genl Crary of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                                    </placeName>) and while they exhibit great prowess and indomitable
                                    heroism—I think they lack that finished and exquisite touch of science to
                                    which the profession of arms has attained at the present day. He is fighting an
                                    enemy greatly our inferior—the miserable remnant of a once proud and
                                    valiant people—priest ridden and every tie of patriotism torn asunder and
                                    extinguished by domestic broils and dissensions.</p>
                        <p>The Mexican of the 19th Century exhibits none of the peculiar traits of the powerful
                                    Aztec or the chivalric Castilian.</p>
                        <p>An hundred causes have produced national degeneracy and they are far behind the
                                    present nations of the earth in every department of the arts and sciences. A people
                                    thus situated can offer but little resistance to the advancement of the vigorous
                                    Saxon, especially when their army is not furnished with the necessary subsistence to
                                    support life itself. I need not be told that numbers ought to supply these
                                    deficiencies—they will not do it—but rather add
                                    others—for the best contested field by the Mexicans was at Palo Alto.</p>

                        <p>He deserves much of his country for his services and so do the officers and men under
                                    his command for the sacrifices they have made and the perils they have suffered in
                                    this most unholy war.</p>
                        <p>You say that Taylor is a Statesman and a Scholar and a fit man for the Presidency and
                                    that he should be the candidate of the Whig party in 1848—for that
                                    elevated office. I will not take issue with you on these points—for if he
                                    possesses those qualifications—his personal history has eschped my
                                    notice. I have always understood that he entered the army at the early age of 19 and
                                    has remained there ever since. That he has never filled any civil office or
                                    conducted any national negotiation. If he be a Statesman it has come to him in an
                                    easy manner, by instinct, and not by the usual mode of twenty years public services
                                    and laborious investigation. <placeName>

                                    for the exercise of the highest and most cultivated intellect and the most thorough
                                    researches into the political and social history of the world. <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, was no Statesman; he was a goodman—Jefferson was more of a
                                    philosophic dreamer than anything else. The elder Adams stands out in American
                                    History as the foresmost of those spirits that are entitled to that ennobling
                                    appellation. The Statesman and the soldier are never combined. Caesar had some
                                    pretension to that combination. Napoleon knew not how- to govern man, but on the
                                    battle field when the fierce storm of war raged most fearful. Wellington, a great
                                    military Captain, able to sustain himself in the Peninsular War and to overthrow at
                                    Waterloo (by the timely aid of Blucher) the mighty cohorts of Bonaparte and his old
                                    guard with the Bravest of the Brave at their head—but follow Wellington
                                    to the House of Lords and he is a perfect cipher—commanding respect only
                                    for his military career.</p>
                        <p>Taylor I think is no Statesman, such an one as should be placed at the Head of the
                                    most powerful nation on Earth, but he may be a scholar. On this head I am ashamed to

                                    party—I want a man whom I know to be a Whig, who by a long life has shown
                                    his devotion to, and his appreciation of, our principles. The contest for President
                                    should be regarded as a contest of principle—and its object, their
                                    triumph.</p>
                        <p>The principles of the Whig party are well known and settled and
                                    defined—unlike those of our progressive neighbors stable and fixed and
                                    not subject to be moulded at the will or caprice of any individual to suit his
                                    wishes or to meet the peculiar circumstances that may surround such individual.</p>
                        <p>Taylor may be the steadfast advocate of those principles. But having been in the Army
                                    ever since his eligibility as a Citizen I presume he has never exercised the
                                    elective franchise in his life. <pb n="388" id="VAA4025-039-4-072"/> The <placeName>

                                    enlighten us as to the principles of National policy that find favor with him.</p>
                        <p>But it is said he will permit the Whigs to use his name, and that in the excitement
                                    (enthusiasm if you please) of his victories we can elect him. Most gracious

                        <p>I have come to a different conclusion as to his availibility, admitting we as Whigs
                                    should support him simply on that ground.</p>
                        <p>A mere military man is not the man for the Whig party—nor for the Country
                                    at large. In reply to this I may be referred to Jackson &amp; Harrison. I
                                    cheerfully accept the reference—and am willing to test his availibility
                                    by a comparison with both those worthies.</p>
                        <p>Jackson achieved a brilliant victory, one which made every heart throb with patriotic
                                    ardor and raised him high in the affections of the people. He was not thought of for
                                    President by either politicians or people until 1822 &amp; 3. In 1824 he was a
                                    candidate, his military career was before the people, he was urged by his friends as
                                    a military man and met with defeat. After that contest his friends shifted the
                                    scene, the Hero of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                                    </placeName> was somewhat merged in the politician—he became the
                                    personification of new doctrines and new ideas of national polity and he succeeded.</p>
                        <p>Harrison rendered important services to the Government in suppressing Indian
                                    incursions upon our frontiers and in repelling British aggression. He received for
                                    this at the time the welcomed plaudits of a grateful people and sunk into the
                                    retiracy of a mere county clerkship. In the spring of 1835, his friends brought his
                                    name to the notice of the American people for the Presidency. The victories of the
                                    Thames, of Miegs, and of <placeName>

                                    after the labors of 18 months campaign his friends were doomed to witness a defeat.
                                    He was again forgotten, until the meeting of the <placeName>

                                    Cabin men) did much to elect Harrison. Besides he was somewhat of a Statesman and a

                        <p>But I have spun out my letter to too great a length. I have spoken as I always do
                                    candidly, not hastily but after mature and deliberate and impartial reflection.</p>
                        <p>I think my dear Sir—it is all idle to think of making a Whig President out
                                    of Taylor. He deserves well of his country. Let him have the united thanks of that
                                    country. Do not divide it by arraying in partisan warfare one half of it against
                                    him.</p>
                        <p>We have good Whigs, able men, acknowledged Statesmen, the pride of our Country
                                    &amp; the ornament of the World—men who deserve well of us as a party
                                    and equally well of the Nation as patriots. Do not put them aside for a man of
                                    yesterday—whose very name was unknown until it was revealed to us by the

                        <p>As Whigs as Americans we owe it to ourselves to the nation and to the World to select
                                    good men &amp; true for so responsible a station—and should we fail,
                                    we will still exhibit to the universe that spectacle on which Angels &amp; Deity
                                    love to look, the spectacle of the good man struggling against fate.</p>
                        <p>Forgive the freedom with which I have spoken for if you are a Taylor man you may not

                        <salute>Dear Colfax—</salute>
                        <p>You will doubtless be surprised to receive a letter from the hills of the old
                                    Keystone. I am an a visit to my friends. I left <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                                    </placeName> about the middle of August—and your letter of the 27th was
                                    forwarded and reached me last evening.</p>
                        <p>I never received your answer to my Anti-Taylor letter &amp; hence the <hi rend="i">stoppage</hi> in my correspondence. I anxiously awaited a reply to that
                                    letter and when West was in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                                    </placeName> enquired of him what could be the reason of your silence. The mystery
                                    is now solved. I trust in future no such remisness will occur.</p>
                        <p>A remark in you letter I want you to take back, as we Hoosiers say—it is
                                    this, "if your old feelings of friendship toward me still exist"
                                    &amp;c. Is there anything in my conduct towards you that for a moment warrant a
                                    doubt of my sincere attachment to you? If so, I regret it exceedingly. You are among
                                    the few I have always regarded as my truest friends and whose good opinion I would
                                    under no circumstances have forfeited. Receive this as evidence of renewed &amp;
                                    continued friendship, attachment &amp; regard.</p>
                        <p>I shall return to Indiana in the course of 10 or 15 days—and shall of
                                    course go for you with all my might. You may safely calculate on at least one vote

                                    Taylor—the feeling against slavery &amp; its further extension is too

                                    an utter abandonment of all our principles &amp; the prostration of our

                        <p>Your favor of the 14th inst. has been duly received but in the confusion consequent
                                    to an adjournment of a Hoosier legislation—I have thus far been unable to
                                    answer it.</p>
                        <p>You have doubtless received the action of the Whig State Convention. It strikes me
                                    the proceedings were characterized by the proper feeling. Everything was harmonious.
                                    The Taylorites attempted to obtain an expression in his favor, but they found the
                                    feeling to be aversed to any expression.</p>
                        <p>I am truly glad to learn that the Whigs of the North take the noble stand of
                                    requiring Taylor to pass the ordeal of a National Convention &amp; to require an
                                    expression of his political opinions. These opinions must accord with the well known
                                    principles of the Whig party.</p>
                        <p>But this Mexican war and its probable termination and the consequehces of such
                                    termination will all have a important bearing upon our candidate.</p>
                        <p>If peace is declared and that peace brings with it a portion of Mexican territory as
                                    indemnity we must have a Northern man for our candidate—as the question
                                    of slavery will then be presented to the people of this Union in a shape that cannot
                                    be avoided.</p>
                        <p>The recall of Scott—unparallelled as it is in the history of the
                                    World—that a victorious general should be arrested and tried in the heart
                                    of the eremies Country is creating such excitement here—and will give him
                                    many new friends.</p>
                        <p>P. S. Will you please send me a copy of the President's messages &amp;

                        <salute>My dear Colfax—</salute>
                        <p>I have a few moments leisure to drop you a few lines. I suppose you are making
                                    preparations to start for Phila, if not, it is true you should for you must by all
                                    means attend the National Convention. It will be an important Convention to the Whig
                                    party of the Union—and requires all the prudence &amp; moderation
                                    &amp; wise councils that can be commanded throughout the country. I take it for
                                    granted then you will attend.</p>
                        <p>It is entirely out of my power to go, even were I a delegate—as our
                                    Circuit Court sits in June. I shall take the liberty however of giving you a few
                                    suggestions in relation to the situation of the Party &amp; the proper course to
                                    be pursued—Knowing that the suggestions will be kindly
                                    received—and due allowance made for any imperfections they contain.</p>
                        <p>Genl Taylor's name cannot be presented to the Convention, or if presented,
                                    cannot be acted on, unless that mass of intelligent Whigs are willing to stultify
                                    themselves—discard all their cherished principles—and forsake
                                    the faith of their fathers—What! shall this party combining as it does
                                    the moral force &amp; intellectual pride of the Union, <pb n="391" id="VAA4025-039-4-075"/> professing a set of conservative &amp; liberal
                                    principles—that have stood the test of severe scrutiny—this
                                    party that is at this moment stronger than at any prior period of its
                                    history—shall this party disband &amp; follow the wake of one who
                                    disdains a nomination at their hands and who is unwilling to pledge himself to a
                                    support of a single one of their principles. Never, Never—I was not
                                    mistaken when I wrote you on this subject a year ago and the lapse of that period
                                    has but confirmed my impressions—–and demonstrated that the
                                    party never would rally around him. <hi rend="i">Even Defrees has deserted him!</hi>
                                    and the action of the Whigs of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> Penna &amp; N. York places the seal upon his pretensions. Who then
                                    should be nominated? A firm, decided, <hi rend="i">available</hi> Whig! <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                                    </placeName> has presented his <hi rend="i">petition</hi>, and claims a hearing.
                                    This distinguished citizen deserves well of his country, and of the party who
                                    proudly claim him as the "embodiment" of their measures. But the
                                    splendor of his genius and the brilliance of his life ought not to dazzle us or lure
                                    us by false lights from our duty. While we owe much to <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                                    </placeName>, we must not forget that we owe more to ourselves. And in canvasping
                                    for a candidate we should act as fearlessly as though he had not entered the lists,
                                    our love for him ought not cause us to place ourselves as well as himself in a false
                                    position. In a word, ought <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                                    </placeName> to be nominated. If he can be elected he ought by all means to be the
                                    candidate.</p>
                        <p>But can be be elected? He is getting old and age brings upon him, as upon all
                                    mankind, its infirmities. His last letter exhibits a melancholy evidence that his
                                    gigantic intellect is beginning to be shrouded by the curtains of declining years.
                                    This to many of his friends would be a serious objection. Add 3 or 4 years to his
                                    age—and he will present the appearance of <hi rend="i">an old man</hi>,
                                    with all the imperfections of age clustering thick around him.</p>
                        <p>Again, what has transpired to make him <hi rend="i">personally</hi> stronger than he
                                    was in 1844. My acquaintance &amp; experiences proves to me that he has not
                                    gained a single vote to my knowledge, while I know of many he has lost. The Whig
                                    Party, I grant you, is stronger than it was then, or rather I should say there are
                                    portions of the opposition detached from the main body—which could be
                                    brought to unite with us—but that union can only be effected by the power
                                    of attraction. Is it reasonable to suppose that men who have voted against <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                                    </placeName> for twenty years will now vote for him? Opposition to <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                                    </placeName> is a part of their nature—and however much they dislike the
                                    measures of the administration, their hostility to <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                                    </placeName> is still greater. Men whose first votes were against <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                                    </placeName> and who have always voted against will not change—but if a
                                    new man is presented they may be brought to co-operate with us.</p>
                        <p>Again, with <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                                    </placeName> our candidate, we enter the contest dispirited &amp; disheartened.
                                    We regard his chances of success, at best, but problematical. This state of feeling
                                    is tantamount to defeat. Those states that voted against <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                                    </placeName> in 44 will do so again, except perhaps N. York. This is admitted by his
                                    most devoted friends. Take Indiana then for instance, and how would the matter
                                    stand. We enter the contest with certain defeat awaiting us here—and can
                                    we under these circumstances make the necessary efforts to maintain even our present
                                    position in our state politics. The Legislature of next winter has <pb n="392" id="VAA4025-039-4-076"/> many important offices to fill, US
                                    Senator—Prest of State Bank—Secretary of State &amp;c
                                    &amp;c. We can secure the Legislature if we have the right man as our candidate
                                    for Prest. but even then it will require the utmost exertions. With <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                                    </placeName> I am sorry to confess it, we would be in a hopeless minority. Shall we
                                    then risk our state elections &amp; ascendancy for the slight hope of carrying
                                    N. Y. Can we carry N. York—I dont know. Greely says we can, but so he
                                    thought in 1844. One thing is certain, the foreign vote has increased very largely
                                    and <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                                    </placeName> can never receive this vote. Nor will the Barnburners go for him. There
                                    is no reason why they should.</p>
                        <p>Again—There are many persons aspiring to the Presidency—each of
                                    whom carries in his train a long list of <hi rend="i">expectants</hi>—these will all feel mortified &amp; disappointed in
                                    the event of Clays nomination. Again, the younger portion of the Whigs regard the
                                    peculiar friends of <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                                    </placeName> as the old Hunkers, who are to share all the "spoils of
                                    office"—and thus they are deprived of one great incentive to
                                    action—and their action, young, vigorous, &amp; enthusiastic, gives
                                    to a campaign much of its spirit &amp; eclat. All these things combined, and
                                    many others might be named, force me reluctantly to the conclusion that <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                                    </placeName> is not the man for the crisis.</p>
                        <p>Next as to Corxin.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> I admire him much, but it is useless to deny
                                    the fact that there is at present too much war feeling in the Country, to try his
                                    fortunes.</p>
                        <p>McLean is a good man but too far removed from the
                                    "B'hoys." There is no <hi rend="i">music</hi> in him.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Crittenden, Badger, Clayton, Seward &amp;c &amp;c are
                                    about par—Not the men upon whom the Whigs of the Nation could be expected
                                    to rally.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now my dear Sir, I have no doubt you are ready to exclaim, "Orth disposes of
                                    all these men rather summarily, who does he say is <hi rend="i">the

                                    is a good, substantial &amp; reliable Whig. Second—because not being

                        <p>I have but a moments leisure to write you. Our Court is in session and I am very
                                    busy. I write you at the request of the Central Committee &amp; several of our
                                    citizens White, Clark, Gregory—</p>
                        <p>Semans you know is out against the nominations &amp; we want to get the right
                                    kind of a man to become the permanent editor of a Whig paper here. We have come to
                                    the conclusion to prevail on you to come here and either buy out Semans or else
                                    start a new paper. The former would be preferable. Semans asks
                                    $2500—Cash $1000—&amp; the residue
                                    in payments. We would undertake to raise at least $500 of the first
                                    payment &amp; perhaps more. I am satisfied if you come at this junction of
                                    affairs you can make a fortune here. This is the best point in the state for a good
                                    paper.</p>
                        <p>I should like if you could come down immediately on receipt of this. I think
                                    satisfactory arrangements could be entered into without much
                                trouble….</p>

                        <salute>Dear Colfax</salute>
                        <p>Yours of the 6th inst has been duly received. I trust ere this you are packing up
                                    your <hi rend="i">duds</hi> preparatory to a permanent location in this flourishing
                                    city, where I promise you a hearty welcome &amp; a fair prospect of pecuniary
                                    independence.</p>
                        <p>It will be out of my power to visit the North prior to the August election, as my
                                    engagements here, professional &amp; political, will demand all the intervening
                                    time. I promise myself however, the pleasure of a visit to the North, sometime in
                                    September.</p>
                        <p>I regard the nomination of Taylor as most unfortunate for the Whig Party. His
                                    nomination is in utter disregard of that strong and rapidly increasing feeling of
                                    hostility to human slavery, so prevalent among the great body of Northern Whigs, and
                                    a abandonment, partial at least, of those principles which have heretofore graced
                                    our banner.</p>
                        <p>Does he stand pledged to carry out the doctrines of the party that are thus
                                    authoritatively called upon to yield him their support? and <pb n="394" id="VAA4025-039-4-078"/> where does he stand on the important question of the
                                    extension of slave territory? All these things considered force me to the belief
                                    that his nomination is most unfortunate for the Party and equally so whether the
                                    contest ends in defeat or victory. If it ends in defeat the party will be scattered
                                    to the four winds of heaven, and will not in our day, if ever, be rallied again as
                                    the once proud &amp; powerful Whig party of the nation. If we succeed, it will
                                    not be a <hi rend="i">Whig triumph</hi>, based upon Whig principles, hut will be a
                                    triumph obtained by the aid of disaffected Democrats, who will leave us so soon as a
                                    favorable opportunity presents itself of re-uniting with their former associates.</p>
                        <p>Whether defeated or victorious we drive from us many, yes hundreds of the <hi rend="i">veq best portion of the party</hi>, who disgusted at our inconsistency
                                    will never return, for they feel as though the broad platform upon which they have
                                    heretofore battled has been abandoned for the bare prospect of availability.</p>
                        <p>And is Taylor's nomination a sure harbinger of victory. I do not so regard
                                    by any means. Look at the state of things as at present existing, with every
                                    appearance of their continued &amp; increased existence up to the November
                                    election. The independent movement loses us certainly the following states, <placeName>

                                    Bronchitis, so as to forbid public speaking, but for the last few days I feel
                                    somewhat better, and desirous of doing my part in the canvass—I shall try
                                    and fill the appointments herewith enclosed. I start tomorrow for Fort Harrison and
                                    vicinity. The Whigs here are dispirited and go into the contest very reluctantly.
                                    The result will be a falling off of the Whig vote. The God's truth is Old
                                    Zack is not the right kind of Whig for this meridian, still we shall attempt to do
                                    our duty.</p>

                        <p>I snatch a few moments from the press of professional engagements to reply to your
                                    kind letter, which reached me a day after my arrival home.</p>
                        <p>I was exceedingly gratified with my Northern trip, and am only sorry I cannot visit
                                    Southern Indiana. I met many warm &amp; devoted friends who by their kind
                                    attentions have laid me under renewed obligations, while at the same time I formed
                                    many new &amp; desirable acquaintances, and if I have been the humble instrument
                                    in converting a single Whig from the errors of <placeName>

                                    Locofocoism I shall feel fully repaid for all my loss of time and personal
                                    inconvenience. At Laporte I found the Whigs ready to enter the contest with proper
                                    zeal—had a good audience and a refreshing season. Laporte contains good
                                    Whigs &amp; I doubt not they will give a good account of themselves. I went to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                                    </placeName> rather discouraged. I felt unwell and secretly hoped there might be no
                                    audience to hear me, but shortly after my arrival our friends called on me and by

                                    amends. At <placeName>

                                    increase. On Saturday they had their granderally (the Barnburners) and strange to

                                    Freesoilers 126 &amp; all told, and not a single speaker from a distance. The
                                    God's truth is they have made a perfect fizzle of it, and from this meeting
                                    we date their downfall. I assert confidentially that V. B. will not get 400 votes,
                                    and many who ought to know dont allow them over 300. While the meeting was
                                    progressing 5 Whigs came to my office &amp; told me although they voted the
                                    freesoil ticket in August they were now against V. B. 3 of them are openly for Zack

                                    The truth is, hundreds of doubting Whigs all over the Country are fast coming to the

                        <p>Your favor of the 4th inst strange to say only reached me two days since.</p>
                        <p>Of course you have received all the Legislative news of importance ere this, and the
                                    only thing pertaining to this Department of Government, that you have not heard,
                                    consists of local bills &amp;c &amp;c and I shall not trouble you in
                                    enumerating them.</p>
                        <p>Whitcomb's election has caused some bitter feelings between the several
                                    branches of the democracy, but this of course is only temporary. I believe the Whigs
                                    took a prudent course in voting for Smith on the first ballot. Our intention was to
                                    go for Judge Law on the second ballot and had Whitcomb failed on the 1st I believe
                                    Law would have been chosen on the 3rd or 4th ballot certain.</p>
                        <p>I am sorry the Whigs selected the 3rd of January for the meeting of our Convention.
                                    The bad roads &amp; inclement weather will Keep many of our distant friends from

                                    May.</p>

                                        Wood</hi>, Quanly, McCarty, Sullivan &amp; Beard are spoken of. Among the

                        <p>There are many applicants here for office under the President Elect. I am sorry to

                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                        <p>Indiana has never, as yet, enjoyed the high gratification of seeing one of her own
                                    citizens thus distinguished. From being the second child of the old Northwestern
                                    Territory, she has grown to a fifth rank in the confederacy, and with a continued
                                    present progress, exceeded by no state in the American Union.</p>
                        <p>We have known Mr. Smith long, personally and by character. As a business
                                    man—energetic, able, and faithful—he has no superior. In any
                                    Department where varied talent, industry, and comprehensive views, would be a
                                    prerequisite, we have the most unshaken confidence that the President would find him
                                    equal to any emergency, and a safe repository of his confidence, respect, and
                                    esteem.</p>
                        <p>Should it comport with the well-considered sense of duty, which the President elect
                                    holds paramount to all other considerations, to thus distinguish Indiana, by placing
                                    one of her most gifted sons near his administration, we cordially unite in
                                    expressing the opinion, that it would be received by the people of this Commonwealth
                                    with the deepest feelings of gratitude as a renewed evidence of the
                                    President's kindness to the State which yet contains the first memorial of
                                    his glory and renown.</p>

                        <p>I suppose you are overrun with the application of friends etc. in reference to
                                    office. This is all well enough. I have but one favor to ask of you, and it is
                                    this—We want our present Post Master removed, Genl. Walker, an active
                                    partisan, and his place filled by a good working Whig, Col. Daniel Brawley whose
                                    papers, etc. are now before the proper Department. I wish you therefore to call upon
                                    the powers that be and see that Walker is walked out &amp; Brawley put in, and
                                    by so doing you will confer another to the many favors already received at your
                                    hands.</p>
                        <p>I am truly sorry that I cannot address this letter to you as Post Master General. The
                                    Cabinet is very good, only the great West is entitled to at least one
                                    more—But Old Zack" no doubt means to do what is right.</p>

                        <p>As to Congress, my friends in this District would cheerfully send me to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, but alas, there are not enough of them to do any good. My own desire
                                    is that my name should not be used in connection with that or any other office. My
                                    practice is quite large enough to satisfy any ordinary ambition, and as my means are
                                    rather limited, I prefer adding a little to my private stores before I again enter
                                    the political arena. I trust your <hi rend="i">modesty</hi> will not prevent you
                                    consenting to run for the Senate, as old St. Joe has been misrepresented long
                                    enough. You can be elected and you ought to go. Take Mrs. C. along and you can have
                                    a pleasant time, but dont think of going without her. You know the <hi rend="i">little ones</hi> will be no inconvenience. As to editing your paper you can
                                    attend to it, a la Greely.</p>
                        <p>Seriously I think you ought to run for the Senate, but if you do not, and the next
                                    Legislature should be Whig you must prepare to be elected State Printer. By the way,
                                    this matter was very generally talked about last session, and if alive and well you
                                    may expect to hear of, or see me, at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> as a lobby member in your behalf—for it is high time that
                                    the Whigs should have a <hi rend="i">man</hi> at the head of this central organ.</p>
                        <p>Bausman &amp; Alert are doing very well. I am only sorry that circumstances
                                    prevented you from becoming a citizen of <placeName>

                        <p>I wrote you some few weeks since, but fearing you may not have received my letter to
                                    you owing to your absence from the City I shall write again.</p>
                        <p>Col. Daniel Brawley, a warm personal friend of mine is desirous of receiving the
                                    appointment of Post Master at this place. His application, with strong
                                    recommondations is now before the Department. Col. B is a good Whig, well qualified
                                    for the office, and his appointment would give general satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>Am I asking too much of you to see the powers that be, and put in a friendly word for
                                    him? I shall regard this a personal favor &amp; will gratefully remember

                        <p>I recd your favor of the 5th inst. announcing the appointment of my friend Col.
                                    Brawley to the office of Post Master in our City, and and under obligations to you
                                    for the interest you have manifested in this matter. We have been daily expecting
                                    his commigsion, until yesterday our community was considerably agitated by a rumor
                                    that Brawley's appointment had been suspended, which rumor appeared to be
                                    confirmed by the fact that a petition was very industriously circulated in favor of
                                    a Mr. Reynolds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Reynolds is a worthy old man, but quite too far advanced in life, being upwards
                                    of 70, to discharge the active duties of the office, and it is suspected that the
                                    object is to use the old man's name for the purpose of smugbling his son
                                    into the office, who would not be so acceptable to the community. The truth is Mr.
                                    Brawley is the man whom this community desires to see P. Master. He is an excellent
                                    citizen—a devoted Whig, a poor man, every way qualified for the office,
                                    and worth of it.</p>
                        <p>I fear some foul play in this matter else the summonssion [?] would have arrived, 2nd
                                    if any charges have been preferred against Mr. B. and the appointment suspended it
                                    is but an act of Justice to him to have no other appointment made until he can be
                                    heard, and until the voice of this people can be heard as it doubtless will be if
                                    any attempt is covertly made to deprive them of their first choice. I shall be at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> on the 1st of June, and if the appointment is not given to Brawley, I
                                    desire a suspension of action until my arrival, and it strikes me if the
                                    administration have any doubts as to the course they should pursue in this matter I
                                    can easily remove them.</p>
                        <pb n="400" id="VAA4025-039-4-084"/>
                        <p>This in itself is a small matter, yet you know how important it is to avoid doing
                                    anything to provoke bad feelings among our friends, and should the Department
                                    reverse their decision without good cause it would meet with general disapprobation.</p>
                        <p>At the request of Sunday of our Citizens I enclose you the enclosed petition, which
                                    explains itself. I have this moment received your dispatch saying that Col. B. has
                                    received the appointment. In that event no use need be made of this petition, but
                                    should there be any further suspension you can place this before the Department.</p>
                        <p>I am giving you a good deal of trouble in this matter, but the truth is I have some
                                    feeling on the subject and situated at this distance from the Capital we must throw
                                    ourselves upon the generousity of our friends who are near the scene of
                                    action….</p>

                        <salute>Friend Colfax—</salute>
                        <p>The cholera having measurably subsided I ventured to return to the City from my <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                                    </placeName> retreat a few days since.</p>
                        <p>The recent elections have proved truly disastrous to our friends, for which I am very
                                    sorry, but it proves also another thing, that the sink or swim original ultra Taylor
                                    men were grossly mistaken when they predicted that his popularity would carry both
                                    branches of Congress while any other Whig would be unable to do so. But I am out of
                                    politics now and shall remain so until '52 when if "Scott
                                    &amp; <placeName>

                                    </placeName>" are the watchwords I shall again enter the arena.</p>
                        <p>The Convention question has carried—if we can now manage to keep
                                    partisanship out of the Convention some good may be effected. This can be done by
                                    adopting the following plan. Have 100 delegates—2 from each senatorial
                                    District—each party nominating one candidate &amp; then everybody
                                    voting for both.</p>
                        <p>I am satisfied the <hi rend="i">people</hi> would readily fall into this or some
                                    Kindred measure if the <hi rend="i">politicians</hi> would let them alone.</p>
                        <p>Suppose you editorial folks who sway the public mind in this government, take this
                                    position and suggest either the above or some better plan—but I sat down

                    </placeName>, Indiana, with his mother and family. He fought under Governor Harrison at the battle

                    1816, the year of Indiana's admission to the Union, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName> was elected sheriff of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison County</region>
                    </placeName> whose county seat, Corydon, was also the state capital. He was re-elected in 1818. Two
                    years later he was one of the commissioners who selected <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> as the permanent state capital. During this same year he was elected to the lower house
                    of the state legislature and was re-elected the following year. In 1823 he was appointed Indian
                    agent at the frontier post of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> which position he held until the end of 1831. The agency was moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1828. Late in 1831 the Indiana Assembly elected him to the Senate of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to succeed the late James Noble. Re-elected in 1832, he served until the end of his
                    term in March of 1839. Death came in April following the termination of his senatorial career. Thus
                    Tip-ton came to southern Indiana and, by "going north," grew up with the Hoosier
                    frontier. He was the leading politician of northern Indiana during most of the 20's and
                    30's.</p>
            <p>Fortunately much of his correspondence and papers have been preserved. The three volumes under review
                    contain more than 2500 pages, including annotations (of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName> papers), yet not all have been published. About twenty years ago Dr. Glenn Blackburn,
                    then a graduate student under the late Dr. Logan Esarey, began collecting and editing these papers.
                    The work has since been carried forward by Miss Dorothy Riker and Mrs. Nellie A. Robertson of the
                    Indiana <pb n="402" id="VAA4025-039-4-086"/> Historical Bureau. They are almost entirely responsible
                    for the laborious task of collecting and editing.</p>
            <p>The volumes are liberally annotated although the an-notators appear to have grown weary or short of
                    space in the last volume. The explanatory notes and reference citations are unusually full and very
                    useful. The index is comprehensive as to names of individuals, events, and movements. The lengthy
                    bibliography is excellent and very complete, and the annotations reflect extensive and liberal use
                    of this bibliography. The reproduction of the text appears to be faithful to the original papers.</p>
            <p>None of the criticisms offered by the reviewer mar the excellence of this publication, but a few are
                    worth suggesting. Notes concerning banking are very confusing. In sundry biographical sketches
                    individuals are associated with "the" State Bank or a branch of the same, without
                    indicating which banking system it was. Since there were three banking systems in Indiana between
                    1816 and 1860 with which the title State Bank is associated, and each had branches, the confusion in
                    indeed considerable. The State Bank (Second?) was established in 1834, not 1833 (11, 157n). This is
                    correctly stated later (111, 22n). Possibly the Farmers and Mechanics Bank of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> did not suspend operations "about 1823" for its notes were listed as
                    land office money in the summer of that year and also in 1826 according to contemporary newspapers.
                    It may have been suspended, however, and then revived.</p>
            <p>The index might have been more inclusive concerning social and economic items. The reviewer
                    "rooted" through each of the indices and found but one reference to hogs or pork.
                    After all "Mr. Hog" was the economic base of pioneer agriculture and he is now and
                    then mentioned in the text (11, 116, 305, i.e.). The indices have no separate listings for
                    "religion," "right of instruction,"
                    "sickness," or "merchants" although such topics are represented
                    in the text. The student of social and economic history will regret these and other omissions.
                    Additional and valuable biographical items would probably have beer, found by use of the
                    comprehensive name index file of the State Archives. A few selected maps would have added to the
                    value of the work. These criticisms do not in any way reflect upon the faithfulness of the text nor
                    the general usefulness of the annotations.</p>
            <pb n="403" id="VAA4025-039-4-087"/>
            <p>Dr. Paul W. Gates, of Cornell, wrote the introduction; and while it is probably the best available
                    sketch of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName>, it is somewhat disappointing. It includes too many doubtful statements and sweeping
                    conclusions without appropriate supporting evidence. A few examples will illustrate but others could
                    be added. Concerning the settlers of Indiana about 1807, he wrote (I, 4), "The earliest
                    settlers were fur traders, trappers, small merchants, land speculators, and government
                    agents." What of the small farmers who were perhaps more numerous than all other groups
                    combined? "TO accumulate a fortune in land" was "the object of all
                    frontiersmen" (I, 9). No doubt many Hoosiers were less ambitious or energetic than this,
                    while some were lazy, even as now. During the depression of the teens and twenties, newspapers may
                    have "carried scores of advertisements of sheriffs' sales," (I, 6) but
                    appropriate evidence is not cited, nor is it included in the body of the papers. "Railroads
                    were being pushed hither and yon" (I, 35) in the 30's' yet in reality the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Railroad, almost the sole work being pressed, was making meager progress.</p>
            <p>Students of Indian trade and removal, public lands, internal improvements and politics will find
                    these volumes very useful source material concerning the Old Northwest—the scope is more
                    than just Indiana. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName> was supported by Jackson Democrats and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> Whigs; and although he apparently considered himself a Democrat, his votes were more
                    frequently Whig. This inconsistency accurately reflects Hoo-sier politics of the 30's, when
                    party lines were not rigid. "Measures" were viewed as more important than
                    "men." So in presidential elections Hoosiers voted their <hi rend="i">sentiments</hi> and supported Jackson; nearer home they voted their <hi rend="i">interests</hi> and
                    made Noble governor in 1831 and 1834 although he was unfriendly to Jackson. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName> appears to have cooperated with both Noble and Jackson.</p>
            <p>This is one of the most valuable publications yet produced by either the Indiana Historical Society
                    or the Indiana Historical Bureau. Dr. Christopher B. Coleman and his staff are to be commended for
                    the completion of this publication. Such good work should, as time and financial support allow, be
                    continued with further publications concerning the messages and papers of the governors, early
                    public reports, the 1850–1851 constitutional convention, or other worthy projects.</p>

            <p>"…We are not dealing with Western history," writes Bernard DeVoto about
                    this, his latest book. But he is incorrect, for <hi rend="i">The Year of Decision</hi> is for all
                    intents and purposes the story of the acquisition and occupation of much of our country that lies to
                    the west of the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>. It is an account of Manifest Destiny on the
                    march. It presents in the best of narrative form the story of that day so astutely foretold by
                    Timothy Flint: "When the tide of advancing backwoodsmen shall have met the surge of the
                    Pacific," or what George Tucker of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> once called the unstoppable "progress of our civilization to the
                    West."</p>
            <p>The opening chapter, "Build Thee More Stately Mansions," is, however, nationwide in
                    its scope. Into it are compressed the major American diplomatic crises involving <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> country. In it is given a vivid glimpse of the life and thinking at Brook Farm. Here,
                    too, march upon the stage the principal characters of the truly decisive middle period of our
                    national history. The artistry of these first fifty pages will command respect from all who read
                    them.</p>
            <p>In no other book on western history is the narrative so ingeniously arranged as in <hi rend="i">The
                        Year of Decision</hi>. The author performs the phenomenal acrobatic feat of juggling at least
                    ten balls in mid-air while he goes constantly forward at a lusty trot. The reader has before him Jim
                    Clyman, John C. Fremont (dubbed "Childe Harold" by the author), Francis Parkman,
                    Susan Magoffin, Jesse Applegate, and many other colorful and history-making personalities, each
                    going his own circuitous path. Simultaneously, he has trekking westward or south by west those
                    "peculiar people" called the Saints, the Donners, the Mormon Battalion, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> immigrant trains, and the armies of Kearny, Doniphan, Taylor, and Scott. Everybody and
                    everything moves in typical, "get-aheaditive" western fashion. The reader is given
                    a choice seat at the "Biggest Show on Earth" where all features, sideshows, and
                    parades are staged under the main tent and where even the sharpers and campfollowers perform in
                    public view.</p>
            <p>Logical as this manner of presentation is, those interested in a single narrative—for
                    example, the perambulations <pb n="405" id="VAA4025-039-4-089"/> of pathmarker <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fremont</settlement>
                    </placeName>—will have to piece together, with the aid of the index, the numerous
                    segments given over to this vainglorious figure. The Donner episode, to use another example, is
                    divided into twenty-six installments between pages 122 and 526.</p>
            <p>While never losing sight of the central action, the author does have a special theme in each of his
                    seventeen chapters. Chapter two, entitled "Mountain Man," is self-explanatory;
                    three, "Pillar of Cloud," focuses attention on the Saints; eight,
                    "Solstice," is largely concerned with <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>; nine, "The Image on the Sun," is mainly Kearny's march; and
                    twelve, "Atomization," is the story of the disintegration of the Donner party.</p>
            <p>Critics will disagree, and rightly so, with the apportionment of the subject matter. So far as page
                    allotments go, Jim Clyman receives more space than Thomas Hart <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName>; Lansford W. Hastings is listed in the index thirty-nine times, whereas the Great
                    Compromiser is listed six times. James Frazier Reed receives twenty-eight citations; Mariana <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Val</region>
                    </placeName>-lejo, four. Emphasis is, in the last analysis, an author's privilege; and in
                    this book special emphasis has been placed on certain case studies.</p>
            <p>It is, however, difficult to understand certain omissions. For example, Mr. DeVoto emphasizes Jesse
                    Applegate's efforts to establish for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName>-bound immigrants the South Road through the Humboldt Valley as a substitute for the
                    perilous last-leg journey down the treacherous <geogName>Columbia River</geogName>. He writes that
                    such a road into the Willamette Valley was "both a physical and psychological
                    necessity." He is apparently oblivious to the fact that during this very year of
                    decision—1846—Captain Samuel K. Barlow, with the aid of forty men, completed
                    the much more famous and much more practical Barlow Road which extended south from The Dalles, then
                    crossed the Cascades south of Mt. Hood, and pushed westward to the Sandy River and on to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> City. During the year 1846 there passed over this road into the Willamette Valley no
                    less than 145 wagons, 1559 horses, mules, and cattle, and an unspecified number of sheep (see <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                        </placeName> Spectator</hi>, February 4, 1847). The Barlow Road, which is not even mentioned by
                    Mr. DeVoto, and not the Applegate Road, turned out to be the practical solution to the problem of
                    getting wagons into the Willamette Valley. <pb n="406" id="VAA4025-039-4-090"/> It was Captain
                    Barlow who said: "God never made a mountain that did not make a place for some man to go
                    over it—or under -it," and he proved his contention by building a route that
                    served successfully as a toll road until 1912. And while on this subject of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> geography, it would be more correct for the author to refer to Grant's Pass as
                    on the Rogue River rather than in the Umpqua Canyon (page 376).</p>
            <p>This attractively printed book has been in preparation about seventeen years. Taken in its entirety,
                    Mr. DeVoto presents a masterful synthesis of the momentous events that transpired in 1846 and
                    adheres closely to the generally accepted facts of American history. He gives many strikingly new
                    and different interpretations to men and incidents of that year and offers ample evidence that 1846
                    was the year of decision. The language of this volume is vigorous and earthy; the style is beautiful
                    and happily free from dripping sentimentality. It is easily the best book written on the West since

            <p>Theodore Maynard is his own apologist for his biography of Simon Gabriel Bruté, first
                    Roman Catholic Bishop of the diocese of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> (1534–1839). "This is a personal portrait of the
                    man,…rather than a formal biography." The author extends his defense:
                    "…whatever value it may have is in sympathetic
                    understanding…." Accepting these premises, stated in Maynard's
                    prefatory note, <hi rend="i">The Reed and the Rock</hi> manages to convey what Mr. Maynard feels is
                    the essence of the earthly career of Simon Bruté There is a lingering feeling, however,
                    that the author has selected his materials to achieve the desired picture; the Sulpician priest who
                    became <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>' first bishop might prove of another nature had the author been more detailed
                    and exacting, rather than impressionistic, in the delineation of his subject.</p>
            <p>The hook is divided into three main sections. There is a vivid description of boyhood home and youth
                    in Rennes, the background for which is the Terror of the French Revolution. <pb n="407" id="VAA4025-039-4-091"/> The conflict between duty to his mother's more worldly wishes
                    and his own desires to enter the priesthood are well brought out. With Bruté's
                    ordination and assignment to America, the author enters upon the man's career in more
                    detail. The major portion of the work is concerned with Bruté's life and
                    associations at Mount St. Mary's academy in Emmitsburg, <placeName>
                        <country reg="mdu">Maryland</country>
                    </placeName>. The closing portion of the volume deals with his episcopal charge at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Maynard has sketched in detail the life and hardships of an early nineteenth century ecclesiatic in
                    the Middle West. The environment into which Bruté was plunged upon taking up his charge
                    is vivid to the reader; the attendant hardships have meaning through the author's forceful
                    description. "As Flaget used to say, an American missionary had to be able to live on
                    nothing and to cook it himself." The life at Mount St. Mary's, the attendant
                    confusion over control of the academy, Bruté's frustrated appeals to Archbishop
                    Eccleston—these are all brought out with emphasis. But the life of Bruté
                    himself is sketchily treated. The "Portrait of Simon Bruté" is a
                    picture of the life and times of the man, but with more seeming strees on the
                    "times" than on the "life." The author's intent is to
                    show the two phases of the man's career: the reed who became a rock, the indecisive teacher
                    of theology who revealed in his last years the qualities of an able administrator. The character of
                    the reed is well depicted in the description of the years at Emmitsburg; the efficient administrator
                    is suggested largely by implication.</p>
            <p>There is throughout the volume an element of contradiction. Maynard stresses the mystical nature of
                    the boy and the man, but often refutes his own contentions. "The eccentric enthusiast, the
                    dreamy recluse, seemed to be the last man in the world who should have been chosen [Bishop of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>]." At times the leitmotif "eternity, eternity" is dragged
                    into the story by the literary heels; yet the picture is that of a man who was very much an
                    activist. "At bottom he was, and knew himself to be, a man of action." The
                    "dreamy recluse" was the same man who spent his spare hours in building grottos on
                    the grounds of the academy; he is the man who thought nothing of walking the fifty miles to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> to deliver a piece of requested information; he is the man who made three voyages to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> to recruit priests and supplies for St. Mary's and for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>; he is <pb n="408" id="VAA4025-039-4-092"/> the man who made a pastoral perigrination
                    of thousands of miles upon taking up his duties at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This same man, this "recluse" was he who enjoyed the frequent
                    company of Mother Seton and her children, who enjoyed the classes at the Mount, and who enjoyed his
                    pastoral visits and the worldly cheer of the French inhabitants at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In his letters, Bruté reveals himself, not as a master of contemplative
                    exposition, but as one who expresses himself, even in casual letters, in a disjointed and staccato
                    fashion.</p>
            <p>The book is incomplete. It has a narrative quality appealing to the casual reader, but the student
                    would be disappointed were he to turn to it for detailed information. At times the sentence
                    structure is somewhat confused and confusing. Maynard has popularized that which would have given
                    greater satisfaction if treated in a more scholarly fashion. In so doing he has deprived the student
                    of early American Catholic history of the details of the life of an important Church figure. It is
                    to be hoped that the author will sometime enlarge upon his impressions of Simon Bruté,
                    and give the academic world the benefit of his research.</p>

                    </placeName>, whom Woodrow Wilson regarded as the last planter-statesman, was well prepared for
                    public life. He attended the <placeName>

                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> at Dijon. He was elected to Congress in 1892 and served in the lower house until 1909.
                    In 1908 he was elevated to the Senate and took his seat in that body in 1911. His career in the
                    upper house ended with his retirement in 1923.</p>
            <p>Dr. Osborn was greatly handicapped in telling the story <pb n="409" id="VAA4025-039-4-093"/> of
                    Williams' career in the House of Representatives as the Mississippian destroyed all of his
                    correspondence for that period when he was elected to the Senate. However, the Williams papers were
                    available for the study of his Senatorial career, and the quality of the biography is greatly
                    improved.</p>
            <p>It appears that Williams was a good "party man" throughout his public life, and his
                    views were rather typical of those held by the more conservative Democrats of the time. He was a
                    consistent advocate of a low tariff, free silver, and an income tax law. From Williams'
                    viewpoint, while a member of the lower house, all trusts were bad and a low tariff was the most
                    effective method of curtailing their power. His relations with Bryan are not clearly defined, but
                    one gets the opinion that he was never enthusiastic about the Nebraskan. In 1915, Williams wrote,
                    "Bryan has every kind of sense except common sense. Sometimes he seems to be thoroughly
                    devoid of that." Possibly that was an opinion of long standing. Williams was minority
                    leader of the house from 1903 to 1908, and his influence on his party was great. His views were
                    decidedly "progressive."</p>
            <p>In the early years Williams displayed rather positive anti-imperialistic tendencies. Although he
                    supported the move for Cuban independence, he opposed the annexation of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="hiu">Hawaii</region>
                    </placeName> and the protectorate over the <placeName>
                        <country reg="ph">Philippines</country>
                    </placeName>. The latter was a violation of the "Open Door" principle and contrary
                    to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> Doctrine. He thought the <placeName>
                        <country reg="ph">Philippines</country>
                    </placeName> should be sold to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> or Holland but was later willing to support a temporary protectorate over those
                    islands.</p>
            <p>Dr. Osborn displays an intimate knowledge of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> history as he describes Williams' race in 1907 against James K. Vardaman for
                    the Senate. Vardaman's use of the Negro as the "whipping boy" of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> politics and Williams' more conservative and intelligent attitude toward the
                    race problem will be of particular interest to readers unfamiliar with the
                    "peculiarities" of southern politics.</p>
            <p>Williams, it appears, was one of the first supporters of Woodrow Wilson for the presidency. His
                    confidence in Wilson's ability and judgment was unbounded: "The people should
                    trust Wilson and leave things to him and not to Congress." Wilson frequently sought
                    Williams' opinion and advice, and the latter was a source of great strength to the
                    administration <pb n="410" id="VAA4025-039-4-094"/> in the Senate. Williams played a leading part in
                    Congress' adoption of Wilson's domestic program. The Senator bowed to the will of
                    his constituents in regard to the prohibition amendment. He was personally against it and was
                    certain that "it would fail because it was an endeavor to require morality by
                    law." It appears that Williams thought the problem of woman suffrage should be left to the
                    states, and he was positive in his view that the negro women should not be given the ballot. If an
                    amendment was necessary it should specify white women. "He did not disqualify women
                    sexually but racially."</p>
            <p>Williams may have been an "anachronism" in his dress and manners, but his views and
                    policies in regard to foreign affairs during Wilson's eight years were those of an
                    intelligent and farsighted statesman. He was among the first to sense the danger to the world from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> militarism. Early in 1915 he urged Wilson to take a firm and energetic stand against <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>. In contrast to his isolationism of earlier years, he was an ardent advocate of an
                    international organization to prevent future wars. In November, 1916, he expressed views to Taft
                    that were strikingly similar to those advanced by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> D. Roosevelt in his "quarantine" speech at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was positive too that "militarism in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> must simply be torn up by the roots" or else there would soon be another war.
                    The Mississippian fought hard for the League of Nations and feared that if the League failed,
                    "within 25 years you will be faced by a union between <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, Russia, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName>." He advised Wilson to reject all reservations presented by the enemies of the
                    League. "It would be better to fail to enter the League than to destroy it with
                    reservations. Someday the American people would knock at the doors of the councils of Europe and ask
                    to be admitted. It is a shame that we could not enter as a charter member and dominate the League,
                    as we undoubtedly would have dominated it."</p>
            <p>Dr. Osborn spent many years studying the life of Williams and the results more than justify his
                    efforts. The volume is remarkably free from errors; it contains an excellent bibliography, and the
                    index is good.</p>

            <p>The present volume covers the administrations of Governor William Hull and the first three

                    Hull was governor is probably a good illustration why executive government without the presence of a
                    representative assembly was unsatisfactory. Several problems confronted the federal government,
                    among which were those occasioned by the presence of a considerable number of Indians and French and
                    by the strategic importance of the area in matters of defense of the nation. The documents do not
                    indicate an adequate grasp of these problems or sufficient attention to their solution.</p>
            <p>This first period was interrupted by the War of 1812. The surrender of Hull and a short occupancy of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> by the British was a part of that war. Some new material will be found on the question
                    of Hull's conduct. It is unfortunate that limitations of space prevented the inclusion of
                    more material in regard to the conflict.</p>
            <p>After the reconquest of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Cass was appointed governor. There followed a more satisfactory treatment of <pb n="412" id="VAA4025-039-4-096"/> the territory by an official of unquestioned ability who was
                    able to secure more adequate attention from the authorities at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His policies included a better defense of the region, a firmer and more Understanding
                    treatment of the Indians, the elimination of English influence among the Indians, and the
                    encouragement of settlement. The election of a delegate to represent the territory in Congress came
                    at the end of the period covered in this volume. Representative government came still later.</p>
            <p>It is to be hoped that the Congress of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> will not interrupt the work of Dr. Carter and his staff but that the small
                    appropriations necessary to carry on the work will be provided so that the remaining volumes on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Territory can be published and similar volumes for the later territories may appear
                    when ready. Historical students of Indiana history will be interested in the papers of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Territory because of the close connection existing between the northern portion of

            <p>"To honor the memory and the work of the pioneers who opened Indiana to
                    civilization" is the purpose of the Society of Indiana Pioneers, organized in 1916, the
                    State's centennial year. To that end it cooperates with the Indiana Historical Society and
                    other historical organizations in the state; joins in the annual Indiana History Conference;
                    sponsors various projects, meetings, and pilgrimages of a historical character; and issues a <hi rend="i">Yearbook</hi> which contains, in addition to a roster of its members, articles on the
                    early history of the state.</p>
            <p>Membership is limited to those whose ancestors, or one ancestor, were pioneer settlers in the state.
                    Because the different parts of Indiana were settled at different times, dates for what is considered
                    the end of the pioneer period vary, ranging from 1825 in the southern counties to 1830 in the
                    central part and to 1850 in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newton</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Starke counties.</p>
            <p>Each applicant for membership is required to fill out a blank giving information concerning his or
                    her pioneer ancestors, where in the state he settled and when, and tracing descent from such
                    ancestor or ancestors. After being approved by an Eligibility Committee, these blanks are preserved
                    by the Society. They furnish a record of early Indiana families which is becoming increasingly full
                    and valuable.</p>
            <p>Of course it is not sufficient for an applicant merely to state that his mother said that she
                    rememebred her grandfather telling how he came to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName> County as a boy of seven, and that he was born in 1822. Such family traditions provide
                    clues and are a great help, but more proof is required. As membership secretary, it has been, for
                    several years, one of my duties, and an interesting one, to help applicants find these definite
                    proofs. I think that some of the sources used may be of interest:</p>
            <p>1) Biographical sketches. There are a number of volumes of biographies of Indiana people. The Indiana
                    Division of the State Library has compiled a card index to most <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi> This paper was read at the Genealogy Session, Indiana History
                            Conference, December 13, 1942.</item>
               </list>
                    <pb n="414" id="VAA4025-039-4-098"/> of these works and to a set of biographical scrapbooks made by
                    the late George S. Cottman and another set made by the Division which is being added to from month
                    to month. In addition to the more general biographical works there are compilations on various
                    classes of people, doctors, lawyers and judges, Masons, ministers (the Methodist ones are especially
                    good), legislators, etc. Obituaries are useful too, one only wishes that there had been more of them
                    seventy-five years age and with more facts in them! They may be located, often, through the index to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapers maintained by the Indiana Division of the State Library since 1899, or
                    through indexes to certain older papers in the state compiled by the Newspaper Division of the
                    Library, or by going direct to the newspapers when the date of death is known.</p>
            <p>2) County histories. In addition to the biographical sketches in these volumes there is often helpful
                    material in accounts of the various townships, the churches, the early settlement of the county and
                    the civil organization of the county. A WPA project, sponsored by the State Library, worked for some
                    years compiling indexes to personal and firm names mentioned in these histories. Work on this
                    project has ceased, but indexes were completed or are in useable form for Adams through Lawrence
                    counties (the counties were taken in alphabetical order).</p>
            <p>3) Family histories. The Genealogy Division of the State Library has a fine and constantly growing
                    collection of these, books, pamphlets and manuscripts, and has compiled a most useful card index to
                    them.</p>
            <p>The three groups of material just mentioned are very helpful and often provide much needed
                    information, but they are not source material and other records which are must be consulted. Such
                    source material includes:</p>
            <p>4) LAND ENTRIES. Most of the early settlers in Indiana bought land from the Federal Government and
                    there are records of these purchases. Land Offices were maintained at various places in the State
                    and the records of these offices which are still in existence are preserved in the Archives Division
                    of the State Library and have been indexed. The records of the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>-<settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
               </placeName> and Winamac-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">La Porte</settlement>
                    </placeName> offices arc fairly complete, those of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>-<settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
               </placeName>
                    <pb n="415" id="VAA4025-039-4-099"/> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> less complete and those of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> almost entirely lacking. Some of these records give the place of residence of the
                    purchaser, which is sometimes another county or state and therefore helpful in tracking him back.
                    Tract books for the entire state are to be found in the State Land Office and for each county in the
                    county courthouse. These are arranged by Land Office District, township (not civil township, but
                    congressional township, as Township 8 North, Range 2 East of the Second Principal <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Meridian</settlement>
                    </placeName>) and section. They are not indexed by name of entrants but if one knows the approximate
                    location it does not take a great deal of search to find a record. The State Land Office has also
                    tract books for <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Canal Lands and Swamp Lands.</p>
            <p>5) Census. The Genealogy Division has photostats of the original Federal census schedules of Indiana
                    counties for the censuses of 1820 and 1830. These photostats were obtained for the Library by the
                    Society of Indiana Pioneers. They give only the name of the head of the family and number of members
                    of the family or household in various age groups. A name index has been compiled by the Genealogy
                    Division. The 1810 schedules for Indiana were lost long years ago.</p>
            <p>6) Territorial Papers. The <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Department of State is publishing a series of volumes in which are printed important
                    documents of the various territories. The volumes for the Northwest and Indiana territories have
                    been issued. They have good indexes and helpful notes. Especially useful in them are the names of
                    signers of petitions.</p>
            <p>7) Executive Journal. This records appointments of sheriffs, judges and justices of peace and of
                    militia officers. The <hi rend="i">Executive Journal of Indiana Territory, 1800–1816</hi>
                    has been printed, with index and notes, as a <hi rend="i">Publication</hi> of the Indiana Historical
                    Society. The Indiana Historical Bureau has compiled an index to the executive journal of the state
                    for some years following.</p>
            <p>8) American State Papers. The volumes on <hi rend="i">Public Lands</hi> contain documents relating to
                    lands in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> district, owners under old French grants or through early settlement and their
                    assignees. They are indexed.</p>
            <pb n="416" id="VAA4025-039-4-100"/>
            <p>9) Oath of Allegiance, 1778. This early document records the names of 184 men of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> who on invitation of George Rogers Clark pledged allegiance to the "Republic
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>." It has been cited by at least one member of the Society of Indiana Pioneers
                    as proof of an ancestor's residence in the state.</p>
            <p>10) Election returns, 1809, 1812. The Indiana Historical Society Library has in its manuscript
                    collection a number of the original election records of these years. They list the voters by name
                    and, far differently from our carefully anonymous voting of today, show for whom they cast their
                    votes! These have been indexed.</p>
            <p>11) County records. In most of the counties of Indiana a goodly portion of the old records survive.
                    The Historical Records Survey, a WPA project, checked these records and listed them with descriptive
                    notes. The surveys for 22 counties (listed in <hi rend="i">Check list of Historical Records Survey
                        Publications</hi> [1943] p. 20) are in print and from these me can tell just what is available
                    in those counties, whether there are indexes, and in what offices material is to be found. The
                    records which we have found most useful are:</p>
            <p>a) Wills and probate records. These usually give names of wives, children and other relatives and
                    show property owned. Also if we are trying to find evidence that John Doe lived in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson County</region>
                    </placeName> prior to 1825, having moved there from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> after 1820, record of the settlement of his estate in 1824 gives this proof. A somewhat
                    unusual instance of the value of these court records was a probate record of 1815 in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> which showed that by the time the estate of a certain man was settled, his widow and
                    minor children had moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana.</p>
            <p>b) Marriage records. While the early records of marriages seem to have been very carelessly kept in
                    certain counties at certain times, those performing the marriages not always turning in record and
                    the clerks apparently often entering the records only once or twice a year, there is often a record
                    which shows the ancestor's marriage or that of one of his children, the latter being
                    indication that the whole family may have been residents.</p>
            <pb n="417" id="VAA4025-039-4-101"/>
            <p>c) Deeds. These record land sales and other legal transactions. They are records which are usually
                    carefully kept and for which indexes of both grantor and grantee are available. Often in counties
                    where the courthouse has burned they will include records of transactions which occurred before the
                    fire but which the party interested has had re-recorded from documents in his possession.</p>
            <p>d) County commissioners' records. Going through these involves a great deal of work, but
                    information is often to be found in the accounts of persons appointed to view roads, to erect county
                    buildings, or to carry out other county activities.</p>
            <p>e) Tax lists. In a few counties there survive early tax and assessment lists. An 1811 one of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> County is printed in the 1882 <hi rend="i">Illustrated Historical Atlas of <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                        </placeName> County</hi>.</p>
            <p>Copies of some of these county records are available in printed form or in the State Library. Most of
                    the early records of sixteen counties, principally ones along the southern border of the state (list
                    in <hi rend="i">Check list of Historical Recoyds Survey Publications</hi> [1943] pp.
                    86–94), and, more recently, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName> , were microfilmed. The films are in the Archives Division of the State Library.
                    Transcripts of commissioners' records were made by the Historical Records Survey and these
                    are now in the custody of the State Library. Some of these have been printed in the genealogy
                    section of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>.</p>
            <p>12) Court records. Records of the Territorial Court and of the Supreme Court during the early years
                    of the state are preserved in the Archives Division of the State Library. This does not mean that in
                    looking for an ancestor here one is expecting to find anything disgraceful! He may have been lawyer,
                    witness, plaintiff, or merely juryman, and if he was defendant, case may not have involved anything
                    which would blacken his character. These court records are indexed.</p>
            <p>13) Church records. Fortunate the person who has <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> ancestors! For the Society of Friends kept careful records and has generally preserved
                    them: records of birth, membership, transfer of membership, dismissal, marriage, <pb n="418" id="VAA4025-039-4-102"/> death. These records are being printed by W. W. Hinshaw in a monumental
                    work, the <hi rend="i">Encyclopedia of American <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                        </placeName> Genealogy</hi>. The Indiana volume is yet to be printed but in those already done,
                    especially the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> one, there is helpful material in the records of families and of certificates granted
                    members transferring to Indiana Meetings. Until the Indiana volume is printed these records may be
                    obtained from Mrs. J. E. McMullan, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Huntington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, from the Custodian of the records of Indiana Yearly Meeting, Mrs. Electa Wilson, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, or from the Custodian of records of Western Yearly Meeting, Miss Wilma Reeve, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Catholics have kept careful records also, but since there were not many Catholics
                    in the state during the pioneer period except for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, these have not been used much. The Genealogy Division has a photostat of the St.
                    Xavier parish records, 1749–1838. With other denominations it is chance: in some churches
                    they have not been kept or have been lost; in some they have been preserved; some have been printed;
                    some have been placed in local libraries or historical societies and some in the State Library. For
                    instance the Indiana Division has the original minute books of the historic Silver Creek Baptist
                    Church of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark County</region>
                    </placeName>. The Library also has some transcripts of church records.</p>
            <p>14) Letters. In some instances letters preserved by the family or in an institution have been
                    helpful, especially ones that told of the writer's coming to the state or events here in
                    early days. A fine example of this is a series recently printed in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
                    </placeName> Historical Society's quarterly, letters to his family back east of a youth who
                    came to the prairie north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1818. One applicant for membership had an interesting group of letters which
                    established family relationships; she has given the Indiana Historical Society transcripts of these
                    letters.</p>
            <p>15) Family Bibles. These, if a fairly contemporary record, are a good evidence of the dates of
                    births, marriages, and deaths, but, unfortunately for our purposes, rarely give places, merely
                    dates. The Genealogy Division has certified copies of records from some family Bibles and is glad to
                    have such copies or these pages, but can not preserve the Bibles themselves on account of their
                    size.</p>
            <pb n="419" id="VAA4025-039-4-103"/>
            <p>16) Newspapers. Since everyone in town already knew all the local news, the early newspapers are
                    disappointing in being largely news of the outside world, records of the transactions of Congress or
                    the legislature, but the advertisements are gold mines of local information if the ancestor be
                    merchant, tavern keeper, doctor, or advertiser of land for sale or for a stolen mare.</p>
            <p>These are sources which we have found most helpful and which may prove useful to others engaged in
                    ancestor hunting.</p>
