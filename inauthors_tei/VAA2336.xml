                <p TEIform="p">O<hi rend="sc" TEIform="hi">NE</hi> of our American humorists has
                    said that it is better not to know so much than to know so many things that are
                    not true. Errors accepted in childhood become articles of faith, and are not
                    easily got rid of. The absence from this book of certain well-worn fables, which
                    have served more than one generation of American school-children for historic
                    facts, will be regretted, perhaps, on sentimental grounds. It does not seem
                    worth while, however, to keep current in elementary books statements which every
                    sound historical scholar rejects. No work of history ever yet escaped error, but
                    I have at least tried to make this a genuine history, in harmony with the best
                    historical scholarship of the time. Many laborious years passed in the critical
                    study of original printed and manuscript authorities for the history of American
                    institutions and American life have perhaps given the author of this history
                    some right to speak with assurance on questions relating to our early history.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Next to correctness the most important feature in a book for the
                    young is clearness. To achieve this one must not treat more subjects than can be
                    handled with sufficient fullness for comprehension. Attempts to write a little
                    about everything are fatal to lucidity. The writer for the young finds all his
                    skill taxed to be clear and to be interesting, and the two things lie close
                    together. One of the highest benefits that a good text-book in the hands of a
                    good teacher can confer is to leave the pupil with a relish for historical
                    reading.</p>

                </note>
                <p TEIform="p">The order in which the various topics are treated has much to do both
                    with the clearness and the interest of a history. In the strictly chronological
                    history the reader skips from theme to theme, resuming under several dates the
                    broken thread of now this and now that story. The relation of cause and effect
                    is almost entirely lost, and history becomes a succession of events with little
                    logical connection. The understanding is benumbed, the attention is but feebly
                    roused, imagination slumbers, and <pb id="VAA2336-006" n="iv" TEIform="pb"/>
                    memory gets small hold on occurrences that are presented like beds unstrung. The
                    rigid grouping of a history by epochs is fatal to a truly logical arrangement.
                    One of the most important of the novel features of the present history is its
                    arrangement. Discoveries, settlements, Indians and Indian wars, colonial life,
                    the French wars, government in colonial time and the rise of the Revolution, and
                    other kindred topics, are severally grouped together. So that, for instance, the
                    pupil learns about the nature of Indian life, the chief Indian wars, and the
                    means of attack and defense used by white men and Indians in successive
                    chapters, pursuing this general subject until it is finished. Cause and effect
                    are thus clearly set before his mind, and history becomes a reasonable science.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The reviews are not placed at regular intervals, according to a stiff
                    mechanical rule, but these also follow in the main the same rule of grouping as
                    the chapters. When a chief topic is completed, there is a review, whether the
                    chapters be many of few.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">The "proper knowledge of mankind is man," and the real importance of
                    history lies in the light that it throws upon humanity. For this reason liberal
                    attention has been here given to the domestic and social life of the people,
                    their dress, their food, their modes of thought and feeling, and their ways of
                    making a livelihood. The succession of events in minor wars would only weary the
                    attention, but the modes of attack and defense and the character of the arms of
                    the various belligerents are essential facts in the history of man in this New
                    World. And the story of the progress of civilization, as marked by the
                    introduction of new inventions and by changes in modes of living, is of primary
                    importance ion any history written in the modern spirit.</p>

                </note>
                <p TEIform="p">This is from first to last a school-book. No other aim has been in
                    view in its preparation than that of making the best possible teaching book of
                    American history. The length and arrangement of the chapters, the questions,
                    topical and geographical studies, and skeleton outlines, as well as the reviews,
                    are all arranged with reference to the needs of teacher and pupil. An effort has
                    here been made to apply to history in a through and practical way the great
                    Pestalozzian principle of teaching through the eye. The suggestions for
                    blackboard illustrations, <pb id="VAA2336-007" n="v" TEIform="pb"/> the
                    diagrams, the abounding illustrations, and the little maps scattered through the
                    pages, are all part of a plan to make the facts of history visible, and by that
                    means to render the study easily comprehensible and therefore delightful.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Instead of a few large maps in various colors and confused with many
                    names, among which the pupil must grope painfully for the places that pertain to
                    the events under consideration, there are in this history more maps than
                    chapters, and every one of the smaller maps is arranged to bear upon one fact,
                    or at most upon two or three in close relation. Only so many names are put upon
                    each map as are necessary to make clear the event under consideration. Not only
                    is the pupil saved from much needless toil by this plan, but maps thus arranged
                    serve from much needless toil by this plan, but maps thus arranged serve the
                    double purpose of elucidating the narrative and impressing it on the memory at
                    the same time, by giving it form to the eye. Each little map becomes a local
                    diagram of some historical fact, and the form of the map will remain the memory
                    inseparably associated with the event to which it belongs a geographical body to
                    an historical soul. Educational writers have said much about the importance of
                    teaching geography and history together. There is not, perhaps, any better
                    device for teaching the two branches in unison that these simple and perspicuous
                    maps, each immediately associated on the page with the single event to which it
                    pertains.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">The maps.</p>
                </note>
                <p TEIform="p">Though the illustrations are by some of the best artists and
                    engravers of the time, and are many of them of high artistic merit, and though
                    they are far more abundant than is usual in books of this kind, there has been
                    no thought of making this a mere picture-book. The illustrations are part and
                    parcel of the teaching apparatus; their primary use, like that of the maps,
                    diagrams, and blackboard exercises, is to make the history visible. A very
                    considerable body of historical knowledge of the most important kind might be
                    acquired from these cuts along. Illustrations of costumes, manners, implements,
                    arms, jewels, vehicles, and inventions are valuable in proportion to their
                    truthfulness. Those here given have been made under the author's personal
                    supervision, and they have cost quite as much labor and study as the text
                    itself. Many are founded on rare prints, others are from ancient original
                    drawings not before printed, and a few <note type="margin" place="unspecified"

                    descriptions of contemporary writers. The device of placing many of the smaller
                    cuts in the margin serves to make the page more pleasing to the eye, while it
                    has rendered it possible to illustrate abundantly without unduly increasing the
                    size and cost of the book. The author can not forbear expressing his
                    appreciation of the liberality with which the publishers have availed themselves
                    of so many of the resources of the modern art of illustration to enhance the
                    value of this history. The illustrations have been made under the artistic
                    supervision of Mr. John A. Fraser.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">In "English as She is Taught," a definition is cited from a
                    school-boy's exercise-book to the effect that "the Constitution of the United
                    States is that part at the back of the book which nobody reads." Since no
                    school-boy or school-girl ever does read it, and since it is not a document
                    meant to be constructed by children, it seemed better to utilize the space for
                    other things than to reprint the Constitution for mere clap-trap. The same
                    remark applies to the Declarations of Independence. But I have, instead,
                    explained the purport of the Declaration of Independence in its place, and I am
                    sure the pupil will get far more from the account given in this work of the
                    various departments of our government, their origin, and their operation under
                    the Constitution, than from reading the letter of the Constitution itself.</p>

                    the subject being assigned to a pupil in his turn. 2. Another mode of combining
                    the two is by following the recitation of each topic by questions meant to bring
                    out from the class points forgotten or obscured in the pupil's account of that
                    branch of the subject. No recitation can fully accomplish its purpose without
                    the use of questions at some stage.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Skeleton Summary appended to many of the chapters will suggest
                    its proper use. It may be copied on papers or on slates and filled in by each
                    pupil, or the teacher may have it written on the blackboard and then have the
                    blanks filled by suggestions from the class.</p>

                    the atlas or the school wall-map can be easily referred to. The small maps
                    accompanying the text may be sketched on the blackboard, as further described,
                    or they may be used from the page.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">1. The Study by Topics may be written on the blackboard with
                    advantage in almost every recitation. The subject under consideration is thus
                    displayed in a natural order. This may be done before the recitation begins, or
                    each topic made be added as the recitation proceeds, thus constructing a visible
                    table of the subject before the eyes of the class.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">2. When diagrams are given in the book, they may be put on the board,
                    to give a visible illustration to some proportion of size or number.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">3. Word-diagrams are often useful. See, for example, pages 13 and
                    121. In these the location of the words or phrases helps the mid to group and
                    the memory to hold important facts.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">4. It is an excellent plan to sketch the small map on the blackboard.
                    This should not be done elaborately or with too much attention to detail. The
                    most useful maps of all are mere diagrams of location sketched by a pupil rudely
                    but readily, as he might do in explaining a fact in conversation.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The cuts, especially those illustrating life and manners, are a part
                    of the history, and the teacher should, by remark or question, draw attention to
                    the facts illustrated by them.</p>

                    briefer topical recitation, developing rapidly the salient points of the
                    chapters reviewed. The review may also be put upon the blackboard, in sections,
                    if not as a whole.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">In the prevailing movement to lighten the labors of the pupil in
                    school, history is sometimes taught by using the text-book for a reader. In such
                    cases, there should be a line of comment or question maintained by the teacher
                    sufficient to make sure that the chapter read is fully understood and sufficient
                    to impress what has been read on the memory. By writing the Study by Topics on
                    the blackboard, a habit of thoughtful reading will be promoted. The abundant
                    illustrations of customs and the little special maps in this book will prove of
                    the greatest advantage to teachers using this a reading-book.</p>

                    subjects treated in the current chapter. There is a double advantage in these:
                    The puzzled pupil is helped to a topic for writing, while the best results of
                    historical study are secured by giving him occasion to exercise his thoughts
                    upon the subjects studied. The teacher will easily suggest other topics;
                    particularly may be pupil write upon the several actors in our history in those
                    schools where access can be had to works of biography or books of reference.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">IT is now about four hundred years since Columbus discovered America.
                    Before that time people in Europe knew nothing of any lands on the western side
                    of the Atlantic. Trade with India was carried on by caravans, and travelers who
                    had gone to China and Japan brought back wonderful stories of the riches of
                    their cities, and of the curious people who lived in those far-away countries.
                    In order to reach these lands of wonder and to open a trade with India by sea,
                    the Portuguese had been for a long time pushing their discoveries down the
                    western coast of Africa. But the seamen of that time sailed mostly in the
                    Mediaterranean, and they were timid in the Atlantic Ocean. The Portuguese sent
                    out expedition after expedition, for seventy years, before they succeeded
                        <unclear TEIform="unclear"/> discovering the Cape of Good Hope, and they had
                    not yet got around that cape when Columbus offered to find a new and shorter way
                    to India.</p>

                        <p TEIform="p">Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa, in Italy. The date of
                            his birth is uncertain. His father was a humble wool-comber, but
                            Columbus received a fair education. He knew Latin, wrote a good hand,
                            and drew maps exceedingly well. He sometimes supported himself by making
                            maps and charts. He was well informed in geography as it was then
                            understood. At fourteen he went to sea, and before he sailed on his
                            great voyage he had been almost all over the known world. He had gone
                            some distance down the newly discovered coast of Africa, with the
                            Portuguese, and north as far as Iceland. Columbus married the daughter
                            of a Portuguese navigator, and came into possession of his charts. He
                            was a man of great perseverance, and he held to his idea of sailing to
                            the west through many long years of discouragement. He made four voyages
                            to America, setting out on the first in 1492, the second in 1493, the
                            third in 1498, and the fourth in 1502. Though a great navigator, he was
                            not a wise governor of the colonies he planted, and he had many enemies.
                            In 1500 he was cruelly sent home to Spain in chains. But Ferdianand and
                            Isabella, as well as the people, were shocked at this degradation, and
                            he was at once set free. His last voyage was unfortunate, and when he
                            returned to Spain, in November, 1594, the monarchs paid little attention
                            to him. Queen Isabella died soon after his return, while Columbus lay
                            sick, and when the great navigator came to court the king was deaf to
                            his petitions. Worn out with fatigue, exposure, and anxiety, the great
                            admiral died on the 20th of May, 1506.</p>

                    hideous monsters. As the world was round, some thought that, if a ship sailed
                        <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">down</hi> the sides of it, it would find it
                    impossible to get back <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">up</hi> again. They said that
                    people could not live on the other side of the world because they would be
                    upside down.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The King of Portugal was an enlightened man, and the ideas of
                    Columbus made an impression on him after a while. But he did not like to grant
                    the great rewards demanded by the navigator if he should find land; so he
                    secretly send out a ship under another commander to sail to the westward and see
                    if there was any land there. The sailors on this ship were easily discouraged
                    and they returned laughing at Columbus and his nations.</p>
                <figure entity="VAA2336-8" TEIform="figure"/>
                <p TEIform="p">When Columbus found that he had been cheated, he left Portugal to
                    offer his idea to the King and Queen of Spain, the celebrated Ferdinand and
                    Isabella. The Spanish monarchs were very busy in their war with the Moors, and
                    Columbus, who was poor and obscure, spent about seven years in trying to
                    persuade them to furnish him ships and sailors. At length, after he had waited
                    so long, they refused his terms, and he set out for France, but certain officers
                    of Queen Isabella, who believed in Columbus's theory, persuaded her to call him
                    back and to send him on his own terms.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Columbus sailed from Spain, with three small vessels, on the 3d of
                    August, 1492, and was more than two months on the voyage. The Sailors were more
                    and more frightened as they found themselves going farther and <pb
                        id="VAA2336-017" n="4" TEIform="pb"/> farther out of the known world. They
                    sometimes threatened to pitch Columbus overboard and return. He kept their
                    courage up by every means he could think of, even by concealing from them how
                    far they had come. One night Columbus saw a light, and at two o'clock the next
                    Columbus saw a light, and at two o'clock the next morning, which was the 12th of
                    October, 1492, a sailor on one of the vessels raised the cry "Land!" Three was
                    the wildest joy on the ships. Those who had hated Columbus, and wished to kill
                    him, now reverenced him.</p>

                            that America may have been visited from Europe before the time of
                            Columbus. The inhabitants of Scandinavia (the country now divided into
                            Denmark, Sweden, and Norway) were known as Norsemen. In the old romantic
                            tales of Scandinavia there are stories which go to show that these
                            Norsemen, under the command of Leif, the son of Eric, in the year 1001,
                            and afterward, probably explored the coast of America from Labrador
                            southward for some distance. Franciful theories have been built on these
                            stories, such as the notion that the old stone windmill at Newport,
                            R.I., is a tower built by the Norsemen. There is also a tradition in
                            Wales that one Madoc, a Welsh prince, in the year 1170, discovered land
                            to the west of Ireland, and took a colony thither, which was never heard
                            of afterward. If these stories of Leif and Modoc represent real voyages,
                            the discoveries which they relate would probably never have been
                            recalled to memory if Columbus had not opened a wide door at the right
                            moment.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Columbus, in his second voyage to America, planted a colony on the
                    island of Hispaniola, or Hayti. In this and in two other voyages he discovered
                    other islands and a portion of the coast of South America, which he first saw in
                    1498. He never knew that he had found a new world, but lived and died in the
                    belief that the large island of Cuba was a part of the mainland of Asia.</p>

                    whose name in Latin was written Amer'icus Vespu'cius, was with an expedition
                    that discovered part of South America in 1499. A false claim was made, indeed,
                    that Americus saw that continent two years earlier, which would be before
                    Columbus discovered it in 1498. Americus Vespucius wrote pleasantly about the
                    new lands which he had seen, and some German geographers were so pleased with
                    his descriptions that <note type="margin" place="unspecified" anchored="yes"

                            mercantile life at Florence, and after ward removed to Spain a little
                            before Columbus sailed on his first voyage. Vespucius claimed to have
                            made four voyages to the New World, the first in 1497. But it is now
                            believed that this first date is not correct, and that Vespucius was in
                            Spain during all of that year. He undoubtedly went to America several
                            times, both from Spain and Portugal. In 15003 Vespucius built a fort on
                            the coast of what is now Brazil; and he left there a little colony, the
                            first in that part of South America. Ferdinand of Spain made him
                            pilot-major of his kingdom in 1508, and he died in 1512.</p>

                    honor of Americus, supposing him to have first seen the continent. When North
                    America came to be placed on the maps, this name was applied to it also. Thus,

                    trade with the Spice Islands of Asia, and the failure to find these was
                    disappointing. There was another great Italian navigator living at the same time
                    as Columbus, whose name was Zuan Cab-ot'-o. He is called in English John
                    Cab'-ot. He had been in the city of Mecca, in Arabia, and had there seen the
                    caravans bringing spices from India. He inquired of the people of these caravans
                    where they got their spices. They said that other caravans brought them to their
                    country, and that the people in those caravans said that they bought them from
                    people who lived yet farther away. From all this John Cabot concluded that the
                    spices so much valued in Europe must grow in the most easterly part of Asia, and
                    that he could reach this part of Asia by sailing to the west, as Columbus had
                    done.</p>

                            1495, when he laid his plans before Henry VII. He received a charter for
                            discovery form that king in 1496, in which his three sons were named,
                            and he sailed on his first voyage in 1497, and the second in 1498. It is
                            probable that his son Sebastian went with him on both voyages. There is

                    mistakes in trying to describe what they saw and heard. When they got back to

                    They made their settlement on Roanoke Island, which lies near to the coast of
                    North Carolina, and they explored the mainland m many directions. They spent
                    much time m trying to find gold, and they seem to have thought that the
                    shell-beads worn by the Indians were pearls. Like all the others who came to

                    to a sea at the west that the water sometimes dashed from the sea into the
                    river, making-the water of the river salt. Lane believed this story, and set out
                    with most of his men to find a sea at the head of the river. Long before they
                    got to the head of the Roanoke, their provisions gave out. But Lane made a brave
                    speech to his men, and they resolved to go on. Having nothing else to eat, they
                    killed their two dogs, and cooked the meat with sassafrasleaves <note

                    the smoke into their mouths and puffing it out through their nostrils. Ralegh
                    adopted the practice, and many distinguished men and women followed his example.

                    Buzzard's Bay. If this had succeeded, New England would have been first settled,
                    but the men that were to stay went back in the ship that brought them. In 1603
                    Queen Elizabeth died, and her cousin, James VI, King of Scotland, came to the
                    throne of England as James I. In 1606, while Ralegh was shut up in the Tower of
                    London, a company of merchants and others undertook to send a new colony to
                    America. Some of the men who had been Ralegh's partners in his last colony were

                    sight of the English coast for six weeks. People in that time were afraid to
                    sail straight across the unknown Atlantic Ocean; They went away south by the
                    Canary Islands and the West Indies, and so made the distance twice as great as
                    it ought to have been. It took the new colony about four months to get from
                    London to Virginia. They intended to land on Ronanoke Island, where Ralegh's
                    unfortunate colonies had been settled, but a storm drove them into a large
                    river, which they called "James River," in honor of the king. They arrived in
                    Virginia in the month of April, when the banks of the river were covered with
                    flowers. Great white dog-wood blossoms and masses of bright-coloured red-bud
                    were in bloom all along the James River. The new -comers said that heaven and
                    earth and agreed together to make this a country to live in.</p>

                    killed one boy in the fight. Each man in Jamestown had to take his turn every
                    third night in watching against the Indians, lying on the cold, bare ground all
                    night. The only water to drink was that from the river, which was bad. The
                    people were soon nearly all of them sick; there were not five able-bodied men to
                    defend the place had it been attacked. Sometimes as many as three or four died
                    in a single night, and sometimes the living were hardly able to bury those who
                    had died. There were about a hundred colonists landed at Jamestown, and one half
                    of these died in the first few months. All this time the men in Jamestown were
                    living in wretched tents and poor little hovels covered with earth, and some of
                    them even in holes dug into the ground. As the sickness passed away, those who
                    remained built themselves better cabins and thatched the roofs with straw.</p>

                    tribes, set him free and sent him back to Jamestown. It was in this captivity
                    that he made the acquaintance of Pochahontas [po-ka-hun'-tas], a daughter of
                    Powhatan. She was then about ten years old, and Captain Smith greatly admired

                            little more than a boy, he went into the wars in the Netherlands. He was
                            afterward shipwrecked, robbed at sea, and suffered great want in France.
                            He fought against the Turks and slew three of them in single combat. He
                            was at length made prisoner by the Turks and reduced to slavery. By

                            of wandering. He got back to England and soon departed with the first
                            company to Jamestown. After leaving Virginia he was the first to examine
                            carefully the coast of New England, and he received the title of
                            "Admiral of New England." He was a bold and able explorer and a brave

                    tried? When Ralegh sent his colonies, Queen Elizabeth was reigning over England:
                    who had taken her place by the time the new colony was sent? Where was Ralegh
                    when this new company was formed to send another colony to Virginia? In Ralegh's
                    last colony he had had some partners: what part did these take in the company?
                    In what year did this company send out its colony? How many ships were sent?
                    What can you tell about the size of these vessels? How long did it take the
                    ships to get out of sight of England? Did they sail straight for America? By
                    what route did they go? How long did it take them to get to Virginia from the
                    time they left London? (How long does it take to cross the ocean in our time?)
                    Did the new colony settle in the same place as Ralegh's colony? Why not? What
                    did they call the river into which they sailed? (What is it called to-day? Where
                    is it? What city is on its banks?) How did the country look when they saw it?
                    What did they think about it? When they had chosen a place for their town, what
                    did they call it? Why did they call the river James River, and their town
                    Jamestown? What kind of food did they have? How much did each man get for a
                    meal? What did the Indians do at this time? How often did each man have to stand
                    watch at night? What kind of water did they have? What is said of their
                    sickness? How many died in the first few months? What sort of houses did they
                    have during the time of their sickness? What sort of houses did they build as
                    they grew better? Who was very industrious at this time? Where did Captain Smith
                    sail in the little pinnace "Discovery"? What did he buy from the Indians? What
                    did he pay for the corn with? What happened to him on one these trips? After he
                    had been led from village to village, he was brought to a head chief: what was
                    the name of this chief? He was at the head of how many tribes? What did Powhatan
                    do with Captain Smith? What is said of Powhatan's daughter? What great bay did
                    Smith explore? How did it happen that he went back to England?</p>

                    the settlers soon got into trouble with the Indians, who lay in the woods and
                    killed every one that ventured out. There was no longer any chance to buy corn,
                    and the food was soon exhausted. The starving people ate the hogs, the dogs, and
                    the horses, even to their skins. Then they ate rats, mice, snakes, toadstools,

                    eaten, and, as their hunger grew more extreme, they were forced to consume their
                    own dead. Starving men wandered off into the woods and died there; their
                    companions, finding them, devoured them as hungry wild beasts might have done.
                    This was always afterward remembered as "the starving time."</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Along with the people who came at the close of John: Smith's time,
                    there had been sent another ship-load of people, with Sir Thomas Gates, a new
                    governor for the colony. This vessel had been shipwrecked, but Gates and his
                    people had got ashore on the Bermuda Islands. These islands had no inhabitants
                    at that time. Here these shipwrecked people lived well on wild hogs. When spring
                    came they built two little vessels of the cedar-trees which grew on the island.
                    These they rigged with sails taken from their wrecked ships, and getting their
                    people aboard they made their way to Jamestown.</p>

                    had learned that Gates and all the people were coming down. He sent his long
                    boat to turn them back again. On a Sunday morning De la Warr landed in Jamestown
                    and knelt on the ground a while in prayer. Then he went to the little church,
                    where he took possession of the government and rebuked the people for the

                    of Jamestown, and had shown herself friendly to Captain Smith and others in
                    their trips among the Indians, was now a woman grown. While she was visiting a
                    chief named Japazaws, an English captain named Argall hired that chief with a
                    copper kettle to betray her into his hands. Argall took her a captive to
                    Jamestown. Here a white man by the name of John Rolfe married her, after she had
                    received Christian baptism. This marriage brought about a peace between Powhatan
                    and the English settlers in Virginia.</p>

                    a living, it helped to make the colony successful. But in 1616 there were only

                    provisions. They were also obliged to work for this stock. No division was made
                    of the land, nor could the industrious man get any profit by his hard work. The
                    laziest man was as well off as the one who worked hardest, and under this
                    arrangement men neglected their work, and the colony was always poor. The men

                    should have land of their own and be free, but this promise was not kept. In
                    1614 Sir Thomas Dale gave to some who had been longest in Virginia three acres
                    of ground apiece, and allowed them one month in the year to work on their little
                    patches. For this they must support themselves and give the rest of their work
                    to the common stock. This arrangement made them more industrious. But the cruel
                    military laws put in force by the governor made Virginia very unpopular.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Argall, who came after Dale, governed very badly, and the colony was
                    almost ruined. In 1618 many new emigrants were sent, and Lord De la Warr was
                    again sent as governor, but he died on the way. The "Virginia Company," of
                    London, which had the government of the colony in November, 1618, granted to
                    Virginia a "Great Charter," under which the people of the colony were allowed a
                    voice in making their own laws. This was the beginning of free government in
                    America. Under this charter the government of Virginia was put into the hands of
                    a governor, a "council of estate," and a "general assembly." The other American
                    colonies afterward took pattern from this threefold government.</p>

                    divide the land into farms, and to own and work ground each for himself. When
                    the new governor, Sir George Yeardley, got to Virginia in the spring of 1619,
                    bringing this good news that the settlers were to live under laws of their own
                    making, and were to enjoy the fruits of their own labors, they thought
                    themselves the happiest people in the world.</p>

                    planted if the colonists had wives. Young women were therefore sent out to be
                    married to the settlers. But, before any man could marry one of these, he was
                    obliged to gain her consent, and to pay the cost of her passage, which was about
                    a hundred and fifty pounds of tobacco. This venture proved very satisfactory to
                    the Virginians, and women were therefore sent for wives from time to time for
                    years afterward. When the colonists had land of their own, they felt themselves
                    at home in America, and no longer thought of going back to England.</p>

                    educate their children, and a college was planned for them. One ambitious Indian
                    brave, whom the white people called "Jack of the Feather." and who was believed
                    to be proof against bullets, was suspected of wishing war. At length he killed a

                    at his death at first, and O-pe-chan'-ka-no, who had become head chief on the
                    death of Powhatan, said that the sky might fall sooner than he would break the
                    peace.</p>

                    the fields, the Indians suddenly fell on the settlements, killing the white
                    people mostly with their own axes, hatches, and hoes. Three hundred and forty
                    seven men, women and children were killed in a single day. One Indian lad living
                    in a white man's house, had given warning during the night before, and some of
                    the settlements had time to prepare themselves for defense. From this time on
                    there was almost continual war with the Indians for many years.</p>

                    distance, they selected as a place to land a harbor which had been called
                    Plymouth on the map prepared by Captain John Smith, who had sailed along this
                    coast in an open boat in 1614.</p>

                    afterward brought with him an Indian named Squanto, who had been carried away to
                    England by a cruel captain many years before, and then brought back. Squanto
                    remained with the Pilgrims, and taught them how to plant their corn as the
                    Indians did, by putting one or two fish into every hill for manure. He taught
                    them many other things, and acted as their interpreter in their trading with the
                    Indians. He told the Indians that they must keep peace with the white men, who
                    had the pestilence stored in their cellar along with the gunpowder! The

                    traders with the Indians, and timber-cutters, began to settle here and there
                    along the sea about Massachusetts Bay, and in what afterward came to be the

                    name of Separatists. But there were also a great many people who did not like
                    the ceremonies of the Established Church, but who would not leave it. These were
                    called Puritans, because they sought to purify the Church from what they thought
                    to be wrong. They formed a large part of the English people, and at a later
                    time, under Oliver Cromwell, they got control of England. But at the time of the
                    settlement of New England the party opposed to the Puritans was in power, and
                    the Puritans were persecuted. The little colony of Plymouth, which had now got
                    through its sufferings, showed them a way out of their troubles. Many of the
                    Puritans began to think of emigration.</p>

                    that had governed Virginia at first. The Massachusetts Company was controlled by
                    Puritans, and proposed to make settlements within the territory granted to it in
                    New England. The first party sent out by this company settle at Salem in 1628.

                    England, many of the Puritans desired to go to America. John Winthrop, the new
                    governor, set sail for Massachusetts in 1630, with the charter and about a
                    thousand people. Winthorp and a part of his company settled at Boston, and that
                    became the capital of the colony. No colony was settled more rapidly than
                    Massachusetts. Twenty thousand people came between 1630 and 1640, though the
                    colony was troubled for a while by bitter disputes among its people about
                    matters of religion and by a war with the Pequot Indians.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">John Winthrop, the principal founder of Massachusetts, was born
                        in 1588. He was chosen Governor of the Massachusetts Company, and brought
                        the charter and all the machinery of the government with him to America in
                        1630. He was almost continually governor until he died in 1649. He was a man
                        of great wisdom. When another of the leading men in the colony wrote him an
                        angry letter, he sent it back saying that "he was not willing to keep such a
                        provocation to ill-feeling by him." The writer of the letter answered, "Your
                        overcoming yourself has overcome me." When the colony had little food, and
                        winthrop's last bread was in the oven, he divided the small remainder of his
                        flour among the poor. That very day a shipload of provisions came. He
                        dressed plainly, drank little but water, and labored with his hands among
                        his servants. He counted it the great comfort of his life that he had a
                        "loving and dutiful son." This son was also named John. He was a man of
                        excellent virtues, and was the first Governor of Connecticut.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Some of the Puritans in Massachusetts were dissatisfied with their
                    lands. In 1635 and 1636 these people crossed through the unbroken woods to the
                    Connecticut River, and settled the towns of Windsor, Wethersfield, and Hartford,
                    though there were already trading-posts on the Connecticut River. This was the

                    colony was planted in 1638 in the region about New Haven. It was made up of
                    Puritans under the lead of the Rev. John Davenport. In 1665 New Haven Colony was
                    united with Connecticut.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">In 1636 Roger Williams, a minister at Salem, in Massachusetts, was
                    banished from that colony on account of his peculiar views on several subjects,
                    religious and political. One of these was the doctrine that every man had a
                    right to worship God without interference by the government. Williams went to
                    the head of Narragansett Bay and established a settlement on the principle of
                    entire religious liberty. The disputes in Massachusetts resulted in other
                    settlements of banished people on Narragansett Bay, which were all at length
                    united in one colony, from which came the present State of Rhode Island.</p>

                    Portsmouth, in 1623. The population of New Hampshire was increased by those who
                    left the Massachusetts Colony on account of the religious disputes and
                    persecutions there. Other settlers came from England. But there was much
                    confusion and dispute about land-titles and about government, in consequence of
                    which the colony was settled slowly. New Hampshire was several times joined to
                    Massachusetts, but it was finally separated from it in 1741.</p>

                    planted in Maine; but this attempt failed. The first permanent settlement in
                    Maine was made at Pemaquid in 1625. Maine submitted to Massachusetts in 1652,

                    that had the privilege of choosing their own governors. In 1684 the first
                    Massachusetts charter was taken away, and after that the governors of
                    Massachusetts were appointed by the king, but under a new charter given in 1692

                    misunderstanding something that the Indians told him while he was exploring the
                    Chesapeake Bay. He sent to his old friend Henry Hudson, in England, a letter and
                    a map, which showed a way to go by sea into the Pacific Ocean, a little to the

                    1609, soon after getting John Smith's letter and map, Hudson went to Holland and
                    hired himself to the Dutch East India Company. This company sent him out with a
                    little yacht, called the Half-Moon, manned by twenty sailors, to find a passage
                    to China, by going around the north coast of Europe. But he found the sea in
                    that direction so full of ice that he was obliged to give up the attempt to get
                    to China in that way. So, remembering John Smith's map, he set sail for America.</p>

                        course, though he got farther north than any other voyager had done. In the
                        next year, 1608, for the same company, he tried to find a passage to the
                        East Indies by sailing to the northeast. He did not succeed, but he sets

                <p TEIform="p">Though Hudson was an Englishman, he made this voyage for the Dutch,
                    and the very next year the Dutch merchants began a fur-trade with the Indians on
                    this river that Hudson had discovered. In the year that followed (1611) they
                    explored the coast northeastward beyond Boston Harbor, and to the south-ward
                    they sailed into the Delaware River, claiming all this country, which was then
                    without any inhabitants but Indians. They called this territory New Netherland.
                    Netherland is another name for what we call Holland.</p>

                    Albany, and perhaps others like it elsewhere, but they did not send out a colony
                    until 1623. Then two principal settlements were made, the one at Albany, the
                    other at Wallabout, now part of Brooklyn. But the island of Manhattan, on which

                    trade, and it soon became the little capital of the colony. The town which grew
                    about the fort that stood at the south end of what is now New York city, was
                    called by the Dutch New Amsterdam, after the principal city of Holland, their
                    own country.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Dutch also had settlements on the Connecticut River and on the
                    Delaware River. But on the Connecticut River they got into trouble with the
                    English settlers, who claimed the whole of that country. On the Delaware River
                    the Dutch had trouble with some Swedes, who had planted a colony there in 1638.
                    This colony the Swedes called New Netherland, and as the English called their
                    northern colonies New England, while the French named their settlements in
                    Canada New France. After a great deal of quarreling between the Swedes and
                    Dutch, the Dutch governor, Peter Stuyvesant, in 1655, mustered a little fleet
                    with six or seven hundred men, and, sailing to the Delaware River, captured New
                    Sweden.</p>

                    1664, in time of peace, four English ships appeared in the harbor of New
                    Amsterdam and demanded its surrender. Stout old Peter Stuyvesant, the lame

                    for territory to plant a colony there. Lord Baltimore had become a Catholics at

                    that the king was the head of the Church. As a Catholic, he could not do this,

                <p TEIform="p">After the settlement of New England by Puritans, and Maryland by
                    Catholics, there was a period of about thirty years in which no new colonies
                    were planted. In this period occurred the Great Rebellion in England, in which
                    Charles I was beheaded, and his son Charles II was kept out of England by the
                    Puritans under Oliver Cromwell. But, after Cromwell death, Charles II was
                    brought back to the throne of England. This is known as the Restoration. It took
                    place in 1660.</p>

                    was taken from the Dutch, and new colonies were planned. King Charles II was a
                    very thoughtless, self-indulgent monarch, who freely granted great tracts of
                    land in America to several of his favorites. To some of his ourtiers he gave, in
                    1663, a large territory cut off from Virginia on the south, which had been known
                    before this time as Carolana, but was now called Carolina, from Carolus, the
                    Latin form of King Charles's name. This territory included what we call North
                    and South Carolina. Those to whom this territory was granted were called "The
                    Lords Proprietors of Carolina." There were eight of them.</p>

                    these lords proprietors, and the land <note type="margin" place="unspecified"

                    but the people afterward moved to where the city of Charleston now stands. The
                    foundation of this city was laid in 1680. A large number of Huguenots, or French
                    Protestants, settled in South Carolina about this time.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The lords-proprietors tried to force on the little settlements in the
                    woods a constitution which they had prepared. This constitution provided for
                    three orders of nobility, to be called palatines [pal-a-teens'], landgraves, and
                    caciques [cas-seeks']. But this system of government worked so badly that it
                    was, after a while, given up.</p>

                    rice-culture, in 1696, South Carolina became prosperous. The proprietors, living
                    in England, conducted the government of the colonies in a selfish spirit, and
                    the people disliked their management. In 1719 the South Carolina people rose in
                    rebellion and threw off the yoke of the lords proprietors. In 1729 the king
                    bought out the interest of the proprietors, and after that the governors were
                    appointed by the king. They had already an Assembly elected by the people to
                    pass laws.</p>

                    who afterward became King of England as James II. James kept that portion of it
                    that is now called New York to himself. What we call New Jersey he gave to Lord
                    John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret, who after a few years, sold their
                    interest to others. The colony already contained several settlements of Dutch
                    and Swedes. In 1674 New Jersey was divided into East Jersey and West Jersey.</p>

                    colonies in order to get a chance to be religious in their own way, and the
                    proprietors of the New Jersey colonies promised to all who came liberty to
                    worship in their own way. The people of Scotland, who were Presbyterians,
                    suffered horribly from persecutions after the restoration of Charles II, and
                    East Jersey received many Scotch emigrants, driven out of heir own country by
                    the cruelty of the government. Some people from New England also moved into East

                    Jersey colony was a famous Quaker minister named William Penn. His father had
                    been a great sea-commander, and William Penn had a claim against the King of
                    England for a considerable sum of money due to his father. The king was in debt,
                    and found it hard to pay what he owed. William Penn therefore persuaded Charles
                    II to settle the debt by granting him a territory on the west side of the river

                            thirty-seven years old when Pennsylvania was settled. he was the on of
                            Admiral William Penn, who was celebrated for the part he took in the
                            wars between the English and Dutch. Penn first came under the influence
                            of the Friends or Quakers while he was a student at Oxford, and he was
                            expelled from the university with others, for the resistance they made
                            to certain religious ceremonies introduced at that time. His father sent
                            his to Paris, and he became an accomplished man of the world. He
                            afterward became a Friend, which so mortified his gather that the
                            admiral turned him out of his house, but later he became reconciled to
                            him. Penn was repeatedly imprisoned, and he boldly asserted in the
                            English courts the great principle of religious liberty. He traveled
                            into Wales, Ireland, Holland, and Germany, in his preaching journeys,
                            and many of his acquaintances in those countries afterward came to
                            Pennsylvania. Though Penn would never take off his hat in the presence
                            of the king, he had considerable influence at court, which he used to
                            lessen the sufferings of the Quakers and others. Penn died in 1718.</p>

                    Pennsylvania, which means something like Penn's Forest. The name was given in
                    honor of Penn's father, the admiral.</p>

                    government by the Duke of York. Everything was done with ceremony in those days.
                    When Penn got to Newcastle, in Delaware, its government was transferred to him
                    in the following way: The key to the fort at Newcastle was delivered to him.
                    With this he locked himself into the fort and then let himself out in sign that
                    the government was his. To show that the land with the trees on it belonged to
                    him, a piece of sod with a twig in it was given to him. Then a porringer filled
                    with water from the river was given to him, that he might be lord of the rivers

                    soon became one of the most populous and one of the richest. Before the
                    Revolution, Philadelphia had become the largest town in the thirteen colonies.
                    This was chiefly owing to the very free government that William Penn founded in
                    his colony. Not only English, but Welsh and Irish people, and many thousands of
                    industrious Germans, came to Pennsylvania. People were also attracted by the
                    care that Penn took to maintain friendly relations with the Indians, and to
                    satisfy them for their lands. Another thing which drew people both to

                    government of both provinces was transferred to Queen Anne, and East and West
                    Jersey were again united into the one province of New Jersey. But even to this

                    two colonies of that name. Pennsylvania remained in the hands of the Penn

                <p TEIform="p">General Oglethorpe was a very benevolent man, but much given to
                    impossible projects of different sorst. He did not propose that the new colony
                    of Georgia should be a source of profit to anybody. He put on its seal a motto
                    in Latin, which meant "Not for ourselves, but for others," with a device of
                    silk-worms spinning. He wanted to provide a home for ruined debtors, and a place
                    of refuge for persecuted Protestants from other countries. He also expected to
                    make Georgia a military barrier against the encroachments of the Spaniards from
                    Florida, who laid claim to all of South Carolina. Besides this, he proposed to
                    raise silk-worms in Georgia, so that the English would not need to pay money to
                    the Italians for their silk. He also resolved to keep out all slaves, and to
                    forbid th bringing in of rum, that the people might not be idle or intemperate.

                    <p TEIform="p">James Edward Ogethorpe was born in London in 1688. He was in the
                        war of the Austrians against the Turks in 1716, and held a command under
                        Prince Eugene in the brilliant and desperate campaign of 1717, which ended
                        in the surrender of Belgrade. He returned to England in 1722, and served in
                        Parliament for thirty-two years afterward. He was opposed to imprisonment
                        for debt, and did much to improve the condition of poor debtors. He was also
                        interested in the efforts then made to convert the black slaves in the
                        colonies. In planting Georgia, his views were most benevolent, but the
                        broken-down debtors that he took over at first were not the kind of men to
                        begin a new state with. Oglethorpe was over ninety-six years old when he
                        died.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">In 1732 Oglethorpe took out his first company of a hundred and
                    sixteen people, with whom he began the town of Savannah. Many others were added,
                    among whom were a regiment of Scotch Highlanders, some Hebrews, and some
                    persecuted Germans. Ogleghorpe bore hardship; with the rest, and by brilliant
                    management defeated the spaniards when they attacked his colony.</p>

                    servants, was permitted to own more than fifty acres of land, and this land he
                    could not sell or rent or divide among his children. His oldest son took it at
                    his death; if he had no son, it went back to the trustees of the colony. It was
                    thought that by this means the evils of wealth and poverty would be prevented.
                    But, like all such attempts, this proved a failure, because the people felt that
                    such laws interfered with their just liberties, and took away all inducements to
                    the improvement of their property.</p>

                    After that, Georgia was not different from the other colonies. One might own as
                    much land as one could get, and sell or lease it at one's pleasure. Rum also
                    came in, which certainly was no advantage. Slaves were bought, and rice and
                    indigo plantations, like those of South Carolina, were established.</p>

                    these industrious people in the English colonies in America. There were many
                    little sects in Germany at that time, and these suffered much persecution, from
                    which they were glad to flee. The laws of Pennsylvania promised them freedom.
                    Some of these sects were opposed to war, and their members emigrated to Penn's
                    colony, where military service was not required, because the Society of Friends
                    was also opposed to war. The tide of German emigration became greater and
                    greater after this; thousands of Germans coming to Pennsylvania to escape the
                    miseries brought on them by persecution and the wars which desolated their
                    country.</p>

                    thirteen thousand poor people from that part of Germany called the Palatinate.
                    These people were called Palatines; they were seeking to be sent to America.
                    Some of these were dispatched to Virginia some to the Carolinas, and some to
                    Maryland. About four thousand were sent to New York to make tar and pitch. So
                    wretchedly were they cared for that seventeen hundred of the four thousand died
                    at sea or soon after landing. The rest were settled on the Hudson River, where

                    New York, down the rivers that flowed into Pennyslvania. From that time Germans
                    avoided New York, and thronged more than ever into Pennsylvania.</p>

                    poured into Pennsylvannia. Five thousand Irish immigrants arrived in the city of
                    Philadelphia in the year 1729. Many of them were bold and enterprising pioneers,

                    were called Indians because the first discoveries believed America to be a part
                    of India. The Indian is of a brown or copper color, with black eyes and straight
                    hair.</p>

                    mostly made of deer-skin. A whole deer-skin was thrown about the shoulders, a
                    strip of the same material was hung about the loins, and the leggins worn in
                    winter were also of deer-skin. Some of the Southern Indians wore mantles woven
                    from the fiber of a plant which now grows in gardens under the name of "Spanish
                    bayonet," but which in that day was called "silk-grass." The women wore
                    deer-skin aprons. Women of the Northern tribes wore mantles of beaver-skins.
                    Shoes, or moccasins, were of deer-skin, sometimes embroidered with
                    porcupine-quills or shell beads.</p>

                    spots, and splashes of red, yellow, and blue. Some of the Virginia Indians wore
                    bears or hawks' claws, and even living snakes, dangling from their ears; and
                    sometimes, also, the savage Indian warrior would wear the dried hand of his dead
                    enemy in the same way. The use of such ugly adornment was to make the savages
                    seem as fierce and terrible as possible. Both men and women decorated themselves
                    with beads, which they made from sea-shells. These were called "wampum", and
                    were worn in strings, or wrought into belts, necklaces, and bracelets. Wampum
                    was also used among them as money, and as presents in making treaties between
                    the tribes.</p>

                    poles. Among the Indians of the Western prairies, skins of animals were used to
                    cover the Indian houses. Idian wigwams were not divided into rooms. The
                    intimates slept on the ground, or sometimes <pb id="VAA2336-087" n="73"
                        TEIform="pb"/> on raised platforms. The fire was built in the middle of the
                    wigwam, and the smoke found its way out through an opening at the top. In some
                    tribes long arbor-like houses were built of bark. In these there was fires at
                    regular intervals. Two families lived by each fire.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">The Indians had very little furniture. There were a few mats and
                    skins for bedding. Some tribes had for household use wooden vessels, which they
                    made by burning and scraping out blocks of wood, little by little, with no other
                    tools than shells or sharp stones, These Indians cooked their food by putting
                    water into their wooden kettles and then throwing in heated stones. When the
                    stones had made the water hot, they put in it whatever they wished to cook.
                    Other tribes knew how to make pots of earthenware; and yet others cut them out
                    of soap-stone. Vessels of pottery and soap-stone could be set over the fire.
                    Often fish and meat were broiled on sticks laid across above the fire; green
                    corn was roasted under the ashes, as were also squashes, and various rots.
                    Indian corn, <pb id="VAA2336-088" n="74" TEIform="pb"/> put into a mortar and
                    pounded into meal, was mixed with water and baked in the ashes, or boiled in a
                    pot. Sometimes the meal was parched and carried in a little bag, to be eaten on
                    a journey. A few tribes near to salt springs had salt, the rest used leaves of
                    several sorts fro seasoning.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">The coming of the white people made great changes in the Indian life.
                    The furs ad skins, which the Indians did not value except for necessary
                    clothing, were articles of luxury and ornament of great value in Europe. Many a
                    half-starved Indian was clothed in furs that a European prince would have
                    prized. The savage readily exchanged his beautiful beaver coat for a
                    bright-colored blanket and thought he had made a good bargain, though his furs
                    were worth to the white man the price of many blankets. The cheap glass beads
                    and tiny bells, such as the people of old time hung about the necks of the hawks
                    with which they hunted birds, were greatly prized by savages. Jews-harps wee
                    also much liked by them, and were sometimes used in paying them for land. The
                    Indian who could possess himself of a copper kettle was a rich man in his tribe.
                    The cheap iron hatches of the trader drove out the stone axes, and knives were
                    eagerly bought, but guns were more sought after than anything else; and, though
                    there were many laws against selling fire-arms to the Indians, there were always
                    men who were glad to enrich themselves by this lawless trade. The passion of the
                    savage for intoxicating drinks was so great that evil men among the traders were
                    often able to strip them of all their goods by selling them strong liquors. The
                    white settlers generally bought the land they occupied from the Indians. As land
                    was not worth much, the price paid was trifling. Manhattan Island, on which New
                    York now stands, was sold to the Dutch, by the Indians, for about twenty-four
                    dollars. The land-sales made trouble, for the lines were not well defined, and
                    were often matters of dispute. The Indians did not understand business, and they
                    sometimes had to be paid over and over again for a piece of land.</p>

                    by attaching to a stick a piece of not deer's horn, or the shoulder-blade bone
                    of an animal, or the shell of a turtle, a bit of wood, or a flat stone. They
                    raised Indian corn, beans, squashes, and tobacco. They prepared the ground by
                    girdling the trees so as to kill them; sometimes they burned the trees down.
                    Some tribes had rude axes for cutting small trees; these were made of stone. The
                    handle of the stone axe was formed by tying a stick to it, or by twisting a
                    green withe about it. Sometimes an Indian would <pb id="VAA2336-089" n="75"
                        TEIform="pb"/> split open a growing young tree and put the axe into the
                    cleft; when the tree had grown fast around the axe he would cut it down and
                    shorten it to the proper length for a handle. The Indians had no iron. For
                    knives they had pieces of bone, sharp stones, and shells.</p>

                    1622 (page 32). This led to a long war, with many treacheries and cruel
                    surprises on both sides. After some years the Indians were subdued by the
                    Virginians, under the lead of William Claiborne. But in 1644 the old chief
                    Opechankano, who had led in the first massacre, planned a second. He was so old
                    that he could not walk without assistance, and could not see, except when his
                    eyelids were held open. He was carried to the scene of bloodshed. The Indians
                    had by this time secured guns. By a sudden surprise <pb id="VAA2336-094" n="80"
                        TEIform="pb"/> they killed about five hundred white people in a single day.
                    But they paid dearly for their victory, for the colony had grown strong enough
                    to defeat and punish them. They were driven away from their villages.
                    Opechankano was taken prisoner, and, while a captive, was suddenly killed by an
                    infuriated soldier.</p>

                    Pequot tribe had just driven away. The Pequots bean the war by killing some
                    English traders. The attempts of the English colonists to conquer the Pequots
                    were at first of no avail. The Indians were light of foot, and got away from men
                    in armor. They continued to seize and torture to death such English as they
                    could catch. In 1637, John Mason, a trained soldier, at the head of a company of
                    Connecticut men, with some from Massachusetts, marched into the Pequot country.
                    At Mystic, Connecticut, just before daybreak, the Connecticut men surrounded the
                    palisaded village of Sassacus, the dreaded Pequot chief. In the first onset
                    Mason set the village on fire. A horrible slaughter followed. Indian men, women,
                    and children, to the number of five or six hundred, were shot down or burned in
                    the village, or in trying to escape. In the war which followed this attack, the
                    whole Pequot tribe was broken up, and the other Indians were so terrified that
                    New England had peace for many years after.</p>

                    in a battle with the Indians at the place where Richmond now stands. The brook

                    ever since as King Philip's War. Philip was the son of Massasoit, the Indian
                    chief who had been long a friend to the Plymouth settlers. Philip was a proud
                    man, and thought that he was not treated with enough respect by the rulers of
                    Plymouth Colony, who acted with imprudent boldness in their dealings with him.
                    He was also irritated because large numbers of his people were converted to the
                    Christian religion, through the labors of John Eliot. These converted people, or
                    "praying Indians," formed themselves into villages, and lived under the
                    government of the Massachusetts colony.</p>

                        good. Schools for the education of Indian children were set up in Virginia
                        and in New England. Catholic missionaries labored among the Indians of
                        Maryland. John Eliot, of Masachusetts, preached to thousands of Indians, and
                        translated the whole Bible into their language. He is called the "Apostle to
                        the Indians." But, even in trying to do the Indians good, the white men
                        offended them. The chiefs and "medicine-men" of the Indians did not like to
                        see their ancient customs treated with contempt, and their own influence
                        destroyed by the new religion.</p>

                    to his assistance. Many New England towns were laid in ashes, and hundreds of
                    people were killed or carried away into captivity. The powerful tribe of
                    Narragansetts gave Philip secret aid, and in the winter the white men boldly
                    attacked their stronghold. This was always known as the "Swamp Fight." Hundreds
                    of Indians were slain, and their <note type="margin" place="unspecified"

                <p TEIform="p">But after a while the while men learned how to fight the Indians. By
                    degrees Philip's power was broken, as his men were most of them killed or
                    captured. Captain Benjamin Church was the most famous fighter against the
                    Indians in this war. Church's men surrounded Philip in a swamp and killed him.
                    The rest of the Indians were soon subdued. Most of the captive Indians were
                    cruelly sold into slavery in Barbadoes.</p>

                    ravaging the Virginia frontier, while the governor of that colony refused to
                    allow any one to march against them. But Nathaniel Bacon, a young man of great
                    spirit, was chosen by the people to lead them, which he did in opposition to the
                    governor's orders. This disobedience led to "Bacon's Rebellion," as it is

                            He knew how to manage men, and had great influence over them. He would
                            even persuade captive Indians to join his band and lead him to the
                            haunts of their friends. It was one of these Indians who shot Philip.
                            Church let him take Philip's scarred hand for a trophy. This he carried
                            about the country, making money by showing it. Captain Church was
                            tireless, fearless, and full of expedients. He first taught the
                            Englishmen to practice the arts of the Indian in war. When Philip was
                            dead, only old Annawon, Philip's head-man, remained in the field with a
                            party. When Church at last found him, he was sheltered under some
                            cliffs. Church had but half a dozen men with him; Annawon ten times that
                            number of resolute braves. But by creeping down the cliffs, while an
                            Indian woman was making a noise by pounding corn in a mortar, Church
                            succeeded in capturing the guns of the Indians, which were stacked at
                            Annawon's feet, Seeing his boldness, the Indians thought that Church had
                            surrounded them with a great many men, and they therefore surrendered.
                            Church also performed many famous exploits in the war with the Indians
                            of Maine.</p>

                    settlers, after two years, finally defeated the Tuscaroras, capturing and

                    white girls, whom they had captured, to make some gunpowder, supposing that all
                    white people knew how to make it.</p>

                    as soldiers could not get about very fast in heavy armor and with clumsy guns,
                    they could not do much hurt to the Indians. Some of the guns used were
                    matchlocks. In order to shoot, the soldier had to place in front him a "rest" a
                    kind of forked stick or staff and lay his heavy gun across it. In firing, the
                    powder on the lock of his gun was set off with a lighted fuse or match; and the
                    soldier had to carry a burning fuse in his hand. If he let his fuse go out, he
                    could not use his gun until he got fire again, for friction-matches were
                    unknown. But the Indians would not stand still while the white men got ready to
                    shoot. This awkward match-lock-gun was sometimes used as late as 1675, the time
                    of Philip's war. The snaphance, or flint-lock, was already coming into use when
                    the colonies were settled. The flint-lock was set off by the striking of the
                    flint against a piece of steel, when the trigger was pulled. (Guns with
                    percussion-caps are a much later invention.) Some of the white men at first were
                    armed with pikes or spears; but it was found to be a very dangerous business to
                    poke an Indian out of the brush with a pike. During Philip's war the pike began
                    to go out of use in America.</p>

                    aside also the heavy buff-coats, which were made of leather and stuffed, to
                    resist bullets. The colonists also learned to march in scattering parties, as
                    the Indians did, in order to avoid surprise, and to lie in ambush, and to load
                    their guns while lying down. For a long time the savages made attacks on the
                    Northern settlements in the winter, when the snow was so deep tat the soldiers
                    could not move about; but, after stupidly suffering this for many years, the

                    so as to make an enemy believe that he had gone in an opposite direction. He
                    would sometimes imitate the cry of the wild-turkey, and so tempt a white hunter
                    into the woods, that he might destroy him. An Indian scout would dress himself
                    up with twigs, so as to look like a bush. Many of these things the white people

                    could devise, but, in some tribes, they even devoured them afterward. Sometimes,

                    would creep up to a window and tap on it, whispering, "Indians!" Then the family
                    within would get up, and, without speaking of making a light, gather the most
                    necessary things and hurry away along dark paths through the woods to the
                    blockhouse. In some of the more exposed regions the dogs were even trained not

                            without a coat, and by giving orders in a loud voice, he made the

                            it. Some Swedish women, near where Philadelphia now stands, saw Indians
                            coming, and took refuge in their fortified church, carrying with them a
                            kettle of hot soap. They defended themselves until their husbands came

                            firing a musket at him and throwing a shovelful of live coals on his
                            head. A young girl in Maine held a door shut until thirteen women and

                        woods, and, by riding all night, reached the settlement. Two little lads
                        named Bradley got away, but they were tracked by the Indian dogs, who came
                        up with them while they were hidden in a hollow log. They fed the dogs part
                        of their provisions to make them friendly. After traveling nine days the

                    house as they could get. In Virginia and New England, as in New York and
                    Philadelphia, holes were dug in the ground for dwelling-places by some of the
                    first settlers. In some places bark wigwams were made, like those of the
                    Indians. Sometimes a rude cabin was built of round logs, and without a floor. As
                    time advanced, better houses were built. Some of these were of hewed logs, some
                    of planks split, or sawed out by hand. The ricer people built good house soon
                    after they came. Most of these had in the middle a large room, called "the
                    hall".</p>

                    Sometimes there were seats inside the fire-place, and children, sitting on these
                    seats in the evening, amused themselves by watching the stars through the top of
                    the chimney. In the early houses most of the windows had paper instead of glass.
                    This paper was oiled, so as to let light come through.</p>

                    table in wooden trenchers, or trays, and ate off wooden plates. Some used square
                    blocks of wood instead of plates. Neither rich nor poor, in England or America,
                    had forks when the first colonies were settled. Meat was cut with a knife and
                    eaten from the fingers. On the tables of well-to-do people pewter dishes were
                    much used, and a row of shingling pewter in an open cupboard, called a dresser,
                    was a sign of good housekeeping. The richest people had silver-ware for use on
                    great occasions. They also had stately furniture brought from England. But
                    carpets were hardly ever seen. The floor of the best room was strewed with sand,
                    which was marked off in ornamental figures. There was no wall-paper until long
                    after 1700, but rich cloths and tapestry hung on the walls of the finest houses.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Cooking was done in front of fireplaces in skillets and on griddles
                    that stood upon legs, so that coals could be put under them, and in pots and
                    kettles that hung over the fire on a swinging crane, so that they could be drawn
                    out or pushed back. Sometimes there was an oven, for baking, built in the side
                    of the chimney. Meat was roasted on a spit in front of the fire. The spit was an
                    iron rod thrust through the piece to be roasted, and turned by a crank. A whole
                    pig or fowl was some-times hung up before the fire and turned about while it
                    roasted. Often pieces of meat were broiled by throwing them on the live coals.</p>

                    china cups, set on lacquered tables. Mush, made of Indian-corn meal, was eaten

                    taught at all, learned to read, write, and "cast accounts." Girls were taught
                    even less. Many of the children born when the colonies were new grew up unable
                    to write their names. There were few books at first, and no newspapers until
                    after 1700. There was little to occupy the mind except the Sunday sermon.</p>

                    Weddings were times of great excitement and often of much drinking. In some of
                    the colonies wedding festivities were continued for several days. Even funerals
                    were occasions of feasting, and sometimes of excessive drinking. In the Middle
                    and Southern colonies the people were fond of horse-racing, cock-fighting, and
                    many other rude sports brought from England. New England people made their
                    militia-trainings the occasions for feasting and amusement, fighting sham
                    battles, and playing many rough, old-fashioned games. Coasting on the snow,
                    skating, and sleighing were first brought into America from Holland by the Dutch
                    settlers in New York. In all the colonies there was a great deal of hunting and
                    fishing. The woods were full of deer and wild-turkeys. Flocks of pigeons often
                    darkened the sky, and the rivers were alive with water. Fowl and fish.</p>

                    to find either a way to India, or mines like those discovered farther southward.
                    But when they found that they could not secure either the spices of India or the
                    gold and silver of Peru, they turned their attention to the soil, to see what
                    could be got by farming. But at first their plans for farming in America were as
                    wild as their plans for getting to India. They spent much time in trying to
                    produce silk and wine, two things which can be raised with profit only in old
                    and well-settled countries. They also tried to raise madder, coffee, tea,
                    olives, and the cacaonut, from which chocolate is made.</p>

                    Indian fields about him, and succeeded in growing tobacco for the English
                    market. Before this time, English smokers and snuff-takers got their tobacco
                    from the Spaniards. The plant was well suited to the Virginia climate, and it
                    was easy to ship tobacco from the farms, which were all on the banks of the
                    rivers. Gold and silver coins were scarce in those days, and, in half a dozen
                    years after John Rolfe planted the first tobacco, it had become the only money
                    of Virginia. Almost every thing bought and sold in Virginia and Maryland, before
                    the Revolution, was paid for in tobacco.</p>

                    But there was living in Charleston, in 1696, a gentleman named Thomas Smith, who
                    had seen rice cultivated in Madagascar. One day when a sea-captain, an old
                    friend of Smith's, sailed into Charleston Harbor from Madagascar, Thomas Smith
                    got from him a bag of seed-rice. This was carefully sown in a wet place in
                    Smith's garden in Charleston. It grew, and soon Carolina was changed into a land
                    of great rice-plantations. The raising of rice spread into Georgia when that
                    colony was settled.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">In 1741 an energetic young lady, Miss Eliza Lucas, began to try
                    experiments in growing the indigo-plant in South Carolina. A frost destroyed the
                    first crop that she planted, and a worm cut down the next. The indigo-maker
                    brought from the West Indies tried to deceiver her afterward, but by 1745 this
                    persevering young lady had proved that indigo could be grown in South Carolina,
                    and in two years more two hundred thousand pounds of it were exported. It was a
                    leading crop for about fifty years, but, when the growing of cotton was made
                    profitable by the invention of the cotton-gin that crop took the place of
                    indigo. (See Chapter LX.)</p>

                    Carolina. New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania formed the great wheat region
                    of the colonial time. These colonies sent wheat, flour, and "hard-tack" bread in
                    large quantities to the West Indies and the countries on the Mediterranean Sea.

                    Potatoes had been brought to Europe probably from South America; but they were
                    unknown to the Indians in what is now the United States. They were taken to
                    Virginia at the first settlement of Jamestown. Potatoes were not planted in New
                    England fields until 1718.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Cattle and hogs were brought from England very early, and were grown
                    by thousands in the colonies. For the most part they ran in the woods, having
                    marks on them to show to whom they belonged. Many cattle grew up without marks
                    of ownership, and were hunted as wild. There were "cow-pens" established for
                    raising cattle in the wilderness, something like the "ranches" in the Western
                    country to-day. The horses of that day were small and hardy. When not in use
                    they ran at large in the woods, and some of them quite escaped from their
                    owners, so that after a while there came to be a race of wild horses. It was
                    accounted rare sport to ride after a wild horse until he was tired out, and so
                    to capture him.</p>

                    horses or as many oxen. Efforts were made to introduce this to the colonies, but
                    it was not suited to a new country. The plow most used in the colonies was a
                    clumsy thing, with thin plates of iron nailed over the rude wooden plowshares.
                    There were many stumps and few plows. All the tools were heavy and awkward.</p>

                    suited to any agricultural staples of great value. So the New-Englanders were
                    driven to follow the sea. They built immense numbers of ships, some of which
                    they sold to English merchants; others they used in fishing for codfish and
                    mackerel. These fisheries became very profitable to them. When the
                    Long-Islanders discovered the art of taking whales along the coast, the New
                    England people learned it, and became the most prosperous whalers in the world.
                    The products of their fisheries were sent to many countries, and New England

                    <p TEIform="p">The Pirates.Captain William Kidd, of New York, was sent out in
                        1695 to put down the pirates that infested the Indian Ocean. The expense of
                        his outfit was borne by certain gentlemen in America and England, who were
                        to share his spoils. Not falling in with any pirates, he took to piratical
                        ways himself. When he came back to America he was arrested by Lord
                        Bellemont, Governor of New York and New England, and sent to London for
                        trial and execution. In 1717, Steed Bonnet and Richard Worley, two pirates
                        with their crews, had taken possession of the mouth of Cape Fear River in
                        North Carolina, whence they committed great depredations on the commerce of
                        South Carolina. Colonel Rhett, of South Carolina, pursued Bonnet into Cape
                        Fear River, and, after a fight, captured him and thirty of his men. They
                        were tried and hanged at Charleston. Governor Johnson, of South Carolina,
                        took another vessel and attacked Richard Worley and his pirates, who fought
                        until all were dead but Worley and one man, and these were taken,
                        desperately wounded, and hanged. Blackbeard, whose real name was Teach, had
                        his refuge also in the shallow waters of the North Carolina coast. A little
                        more than a year after the overthrow of Bonnet, Lieutenant Maynard sailed
                        from Virginia and fought Blackbeard in Ocracoke Inlet. After a hand-to-hand
                        battle all the pirates were killed or wounded, and Maynard sailed back with
                        Blackbeard's head hanging at his bowsprit. So many of the pirates were
                        captured in the next half-dozen years that they gave little trouble
                        afterward.</p>

                    for their great size and the long voyages they made. But before the Revolution
                    New York was not so large a town as Boston. Philadelphia, which was started
                    later than the other leading cities, grew fast and became the greatest of all
                    the cities in the colonies. <note type="margin" place="unspecified"

                <p TEIform="p">There were many pirates on the coast, who sometimes grew so numerous
                    and bold as to interrupt trade. Some of them were caught and hanged. Captain
                    Kidd, of New York, who was sent to put down pirates, became a pirate himself,
                    and was taken to London and there hanged. The most noted of the pirates was a
                    cruel desperado called Blackbeard, who was killed after a bloody fight in
                    Ocracoke Inlet in North Carolina. Steed Bonnet, another famous pirate, was
                    captured about the same time and executed at Charleston.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">WHEN the English people came to this country they brought English
                    ways with them. In England at that time the lands of rich men were cultivated by
                    tenants, who not only paid rent, but owed much respect and service to their
                    "lord", as they called the owner of their lands. If these tenants did not pay
                    their rent faithfully, they could be punished. Many of the people sent to
                    Virginia at first were tenants, who were expected to work on other people's land
                    in a sort of subjection. They were to pay half of all they produced to the
                    land-owner, and they were bound to stay on the land for seven years. Tenants
                    were also sent to Maryland, and the Dutch established the same system in New
                    York.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Besides tenants, there were sent to Virginia people of a poorer
                    class, who were called "indentured servants." Those sent at first were poor boys
                    and girls, bound to serve until they were of age. After a while there were sent
                    to Virginia and to New England adult servants, bound to serve for seven or ten
                    years, but afterward they were only required to serve four years to pay their
                    passage. This way of getting laborers became very common, and many thousands
                    were sent over in this temporary bondage. During the time of their bondage they
                    could be bought and sold like slaves. They were often whipped and otherwise
                    cruelly treated when they chanced to fall into the hands of hard-hearted
                    masters.</p>

                    "crimps." By many false stories they persuaded poor men to go to the colonies as
                    servants. Sometimes the crimps entrapped a man aboard ship, where he was
                    detained and carried off to the colonies against his will. This was called
                    "trapanning" a man. Sometimes they kidnapped or "spirited" away children, and
                    sold them into service in the colonies. Sometimes people who wished to inherit
                    an estate sent away the true heir and had him sold in America. One lad, who

                    fifteen hundred of them were sold in Virginia every year. In Pennsylvania the

                    farmers were called "soul-drivers." Many of the bond-servants, when their time
                    was out, got land and grew rich. But the lot of the poor man was much harder in
                    that time than in our day.</p>

                    a Dutch ship into James River, which sold nineteen negroes to the planters. They
                    were the first slaves in America. In that day it was thought right to make
                    slaves of negroes because they were heathens; but for a long time the number of
                    slaves that came into the colonies was small. White bond-servants did the most
                    of the work in Maryland and Virginia until about the close of the seventeenth
                    century, when the high price of tobacco caused a great many negroes to be
                    brought. About the same time the introduction of rice into South Carolina
                    creatred a great demand for slaves.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">There were slaves in all the colonies. But in the colonies far to the
                    north there was no crop that would make their labor profitable. Negroes in New
                    England were mostly kept for house-servants. In New York city and in
                    Philadelphia there were a great many, but not many in the country regions about
                    these cities, where wheat was the chief crop for wheat did not require much hard
                    labor. The larger number of negroes were taken to the colonies which raised
                    tobacco, rice, and indigo. Negroes were especially fitted to endure a hot and
                    malarial climate. After the Revolution, slavery was abolished in the colonies
                    that had few negroes. But, where almost all the labor was done by slaves, it was
                    much harder to get rid of slavery. This led to the difference between free and
                    slave States, and at last to our civil war.</p>

                    wild African customs. Some of them were fierce, and the white people were afraid
                    of them. Great harshness was used to subdue them. The negroes often made bloody
                    insurrections, which were put down with great harshness. One of these was in New
                    York city in 1712. Twenty-four negroes were put to death on this occasion, some
                    of them in the cruel ways used in that time. In 1740 there was an uprising of
                    slaves in South Carolina, and a battle between them and the white people, in
                    which the negroes were routed. In 1714, on a bare alarm of intended
                    insurrection, thirty-three slaves were executed in New York, thirteen of them by
                    fire. Like severity was shown in other colonies, for people were more cruel in
                    that day than in later times.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">OUR forefathers brought many curious old customs and laws from
                    England. The laws of that time were very meddlesome. Men were punished for
                    lying, which nowadays we think is only to be cured by good example and good
                    teaching. A fine was imposed on profane swearing by the laws of nearly all the
                    colonies; in New England the tongue of the swearer was sometimes pinched in the
                    opening of a split stick. In all the colonies there were laws about keeping the
                    Sabbath; in many of them there were punishments for not going to church. In New
                    England the Sunday laws were rigorously enforced, and the Sabbath was made to
                    begin at sunset on Saturday evening. The people were at first called to church
                    by beating a drum in the streets. For more than a hundred years after the
                    settlement of Massachusetts, people were not allowed to sit in Boston Common on
                    Sunday, or to walk in the streets except to church, or to take a breath of air

                    directly in front of their own doors. Two young people were arrested in
                    Connecticut for sitting together on Sunday under a tree in an orchard.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">If men were punished for swearing, women were also forbidden to be
                    too free with their tongues. In Virginia and some other colonies women, for
                    scolding or slander, were put upon a ducking-stool and dipped in water. In New
                    England they were gagged and set by their own doors, "for all comers and goers
                    to gaze at." Drunkards were sometimes obliged to wear a red letter D about their
                    necks, and other offenses were punished by suspending a letter, or a picture, or
                    a halter about the neck.</p>

                    customary punishments of whipping on the bare back, cropping or boring the ears,
                    and branding the hand with a hot iron. There were also sometimes, for great
                    crimes, cruel punishments of burning alive, or hanging alive in chains, but
                    these were very rare.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Our forefathers were more superstitious than people are now, and they
                    were very much afraid of witches. This foolish belief in witchcraft prevailed
                    both in England and America. People sometimes nailed up horseshoes, or hung up
                    laurel-boughs in their houses, to protect themselves from magic charms. When
                    butter would not come for churning, red-hot horseshoes were dropped into the
                    milk to "burn the witch out." When pigs were sick and thought to be bewitched,
                    their ears and tails were cut off and burned. There were people tried in almost
                    every colony for witchcraft. In England and in many other countries, executions
                    for witchcraft were more common than in any of the colonies.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Of the many excitements about witchcraft in the colonies, the one
                    that went to the greatest extreme was that in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692. So
                    great was the agitation that the most serious people lost their self-possession,
                    and some poor people even believed themselves to be witches, and confessed it.
                    In the fright and indignation that prevailed, twenty people were executed, and
                    the jails were crowded with the accused. One fourth of the inhabitants of Salem
                    moved away, afraid either of the witches or of being charged with witchcraft. At
                    length reason returned to the people, the prisoners were released, and there was
                    the deepest grief that the fanaticism had gone so far. There has never been an
                    execution for witch-craft in this country from that day to this, thought there
                    are still some ignorant people who believe in such things.</p>

                    religious opinions. In Virginia, only the Church of England form of worship was
                    allowed at first, and Catholics, Puritans, Quakers, Presbyterians, <note

                    Massachusetts, for a longtime, only the Puritan or Congregational worship, as
                    set up by law, was allowed. Those who advocated other doctrines were punished,
                    and many Quakers were whipped, and some of them even put to death for coming
                    back after they had been banished. Lord Baltimore wished to give toleration in
                    Maryland to all who believed in Christ, but the law-makers of Maryland afterward
                    made laws to annoy those who were of Lord Baltimore's own religionthe Roman
                    Catholic. Roger Williams, who was banished from Massachusetts for his opinions,
                    founded what is now called Rhode Island, on the plan of entire liberty in
                    religious matters. He went further than Lord Baltimore, and gave to Hebrews and
                    to unbelievers the same liberty with Christians. In Pennsylvania, where the
                    Friends or Quakers were in the majority, there was toleration; and persecution
                    ceased in all the colonies before the Revolution.</p>

                    forty-two years before the first permanent English colony landed at Jamestown.
                    Saint Augustine is thus the oldest city in the United States. But the Spaniards
                    were too busy in Mexico and in Central and South America to push their
                    settlements farther to the north, though they were very jealous of the English
                    colonies, and especially of South Carolina and Georgia.</p>

                            lay-n; commonly in English, ponss deh lee' -on], an old Spanish
                            explorer, set sail in 1513 from the island of Porto Rico, to discover a
                            land reported to lie to the northward of Cuba, and which had somehow
                            come to be called Bimini [bee-mee-nee]. It was said to contain a
                            fountain, by bathing in which an old man would be made young again. On
                            Easter Sunday Ponce discovered the mainland, which he called Florida,
                            from Pascua Florida [pas'-kwah floree'-dah], the Spanish name for Easter
                            Sunday. In 1512 Ponce tried to settle Florida, but his party was
                            attacked and he was mortally wounded by the Indians. Florida was then
                            believed to be an island. After his death, other Spanish adventures
                            explored the coast from Labrador southward, and even tried to find
                            goldmines, and plant colonies in the interior of the country. The most
                            famous of these expeditions was that of Hernanado de Soto [aer-nan' -do
                            day so' -to], a Spanish explorer, who reached Florida in 1539. He
                            marched through Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. He was determined to
                            find some land yielding gold, like Mexico and Peru. But he treated the
                            Indians cruelly, killing some of them wantonly, and forcing others to
                            serve him as slaves. The savages, in turn, attacked him again and again,
                            until his party was sadly reduced. De Soto tried to descend the
                            Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico, but at the mouth of the Gulf of
                            Mexico, but at the mouth of the Red River he died of a fever. His body
                            was buried in the Mississippi, to keep the Indians from disfiguring it
                            in revenge. A few of his followers reached the Gulf and got to the
                            Spanish settlements in Mexico.</p>

                    real settlement of Canada was begun, and it was always the capital of the vast
                    establishments of the French in America.</p>

                    and they were much more daring in their explorations than the English colonists,
                    whose chief business was farming. A French explorer named Joliet [zhl-yay]
                    reached the Mississippi in 1673, and another Frenchman, La Salle [lah-sahl],
                    explored the great country west of the Alleghany Mountains, and discovered the
                    Ohio. After many disasters and failures, La Salle succeeded in reaching the
                    mouth of the Mississippi. Father Hennepin, a priest, explored the upper
                    Mississippi. The French then laid claim to all the country west of the
                    Alleghanies. Over the region they established posts and mission-houses, while
                    the English contented themselves with multiplying their farming settlements east
                    of the mountains.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">When La Salle reached the mouth of the Mississippi he took possession
                    of the country in the name of Louis XIV., and called it Louisiana, in honor of
                    that king. The settlement of Louisiana was begun in 1699. The French held the
                    St. Lawrence and the Mississippi, the two great water-ways of North America, and
                    they controlled most of the Indian tribes by means of missionaries and traders.

                <p TEIform="p">But the weakness of the French in America lay in the fewness of their
                    people. Canada, the oldest of their colonies, was in a country too cold to be a
                    prosperous farming country in that day. Besides, its growths was checked by the
                    system of lordships with tenants, which some of the English colonies had also
                    tried. But inferior as the French were in numbers, they were strong in their
                    military character; they were almost all soldiers. The English were divided in
                    to colonies, and could never be made to act together; but the French from Canada
                    to the Mississippi, were absolutely subjected to their governors.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">The French were also rendered terrible to the English colonies by
                    their skill in controlling the Indians. The great business of the French in
                    Canada was the furtrade, and this was pushed with an energy that quite left the
                    English traders behind. The French drew furs from the shores of Lake Superior
                    and from beyond the Mississippi. The French traders gained great influence over
                    the Indians. The English treated the Indians as inferiors, the French lived
                    among them on themes of equality. The French also gained control of the Indian
                    tribes by means of missionary priests, who risked their lives and spent their
                    days in the dirty cabins of the savages to teach them religion. The powerful
                    Iroquois confederacy, known as the "Five Nations," and afterward as the "Six
                    Nations," sided with the English, and hated and killed the French. They lived in
                    what is now the State of New York. But the most of the tribes were managed by
                    the French, who sent missionaries to convert them ambassadors <note

                <p TEIform="p">The wars between the French colony in Canada and the English colonies
                    in what is now the United States were caused partly by wars between France and
                    England in Europe. But there were also causes enough for enmity in the state of
                    affairs on this side of the ocean. First, there was always a quarrel about
                    territory. The French claimed that part of what is now the State of Maine which
                    lies east of the Kennebec River, while the English claimed to the St. Croix. The
                    French also claimed all the country back of the Alleghanies. With a population
                    not more than one twentieth of the of one of the English colonies, they spread
                    their claim over all the country watered by the lakes and the tributaries of the
                    Mississippi, including more than half of the present United States. Second, both
                    France and England wished to control the fisheries of the eastern coast. Third,
                    both the French and the English endeavored to get the entire control of the
                    fur-trade. To do this the French tried to win the Iroquois Confederacy to their
                    interest, while the English sought to take the trade of the Western tribes away
                    from the French. Fourth, the French were Catholics and the English mostly
                    Protestants. In that age men were very bigoted about religion, and hated and
                    feared those who differed from them.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">THERE were four wars with the French during the colonial time. The
                    first was called "King William's War," from William III, King of England. It
                    lasted from 1689 to 1697. In this war the first severe blow fell on the
                    settlements of Maine, where the Indians in the French interest attacked the
                    settlers in June, 1689, paying old grudges by torturing their victims. But the
                    French did not escape. The Iroquois Indians were in alliance with the English,
                    and had, besides their own reasons for taking revenge on the French. In this
                    same summer of 1689 they attacked the settlements about Montreal at daybreak,
                    and killed, in their horrible way, two hundred people, and carried as many more
                    into captivity.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">The French replied, not by assailing the Indians, but by carrying
                    fire and massacre into the province of New York. In the bitter weather of
                    January, 1690, a party of one hundred and ten, French and Indians, having
                    traveled through frozen forests for any days, entered Schenectady
                    [sken-ec'-ta-dy] at midnight and massacred sixty of its people. Those who
                    escaped fled half naked through the snow to Albany, sixteen miles <note

                    fell on the settlement at Salmon Falls, N. H., and third carried the like
                    horrors to Casco Bay, in Maine. All the people on the frontier of the Northern
                    colonies were now in terror.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">To meet the danger, some sort of united action among the colonies was
                    necessary. A congress of commissioners from several colonies met in New York, in
                    1690, and planned an invasion of Canada. In accordance with this plan, Sir
                    William Phips took Port Royal, in Nova Scotia. Two expeditions were sent against
                    Quebec: the one from New York and Connecticut went by Lakes George and
                    Champlain; the other, from Boston, under Sir William Phips, was sent in a fleet
                    of thirty-four ships. The land expedition was a failure, and never even reached
                    Canada. The fleet reached Quebec, but failed to capture it.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">But peter Schuyler, of Albany, a man much beloved by the Iroquois,
                    who called him "Quider," led an expedition, in 1696, into the French
                    settlements. He did what he could to prevent Indian cruelties. But the war was
                    made up of barbarities and miseries without result, until peace between France
                    and England, in 1697, brought a little welcome repose to the colonists of both
                    nations, after eight years of war.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">In 1702 began the war known as "Queen Annes's War." In this war
                    England fought against Spain as well as France. South Caroliana was involved in
                    a war with the Spaniards and Indians of Florida, while the Northern colonies
                    were struggling against Canada. The Governor of South Carolina made successful
                    inroads upon the Florida Indians, but he could not capture St. Augustine. Port
                    Royal, in Nova Scotia, was again taken from the French in 1710, but the attempts
                    made to take Quebec were once more a failure. The war was chiefly notable for
                    the horrible onslaughts of the Canada Indians on some of the towns of the
                    Northern frontier. Deerfield, in western Massachusetts, was destroyed in 1704,
                    and more than a hundred of its people carried into captivity. The war lasted
                    about eleven years. A treaty was made in 1713, and there was a long peace
                    between France and England. But the intrigues of both powers with the savages
                    continued, and New England had many bloody engagements with the Indians of
                    Maine, who were under the influence of the French.</p>

                    Georgia, tried to conquer Florida, but the fortifications of St. Augustine were
                    too strong for him. Two years later the Spaniards invaded Georgia, but
                    Oglethorpe manoeuvred his little force with so much skill as to lead the Spanish

                    Governor Shirley, of Massachusetts, sent against this place four thousand
                    untrained New England militia. They were commanded by a merchant, and their
                    officers did not know even the meaning of military terms. But they made up in
                    courage and enthusiasm for their inexperience. The <figure entity="VAA2336-149"

                    favorite amusement had always been target-shooting, and the deadly skill with
                    which they used their muskets made it almost impossible for the French to work
                    their guns. The excitement over this contest put a stop to almost all kinds of
                    business in the Eastern colonies, and when at length the powerful fortress
                    surrendered to a little army of farmers and mechanics, there was no end of joy
                    in New England. This was the chief victory of the war, and it gave the American
                    troops confidence in themselves. At the close of the war, in 1748, England
                    returned the place again to the French, in exchange for advantages elsewhere.
                    This was a bitter disappointment to the New-Englanders, who called the day of
                    its surrender a "black day to be forever bloted out of New Englandcalendars."</p>

                    Mississippi Valley. (Let the pupil, after examining a map of the United States,
                    decide whether the portion of our country drained by rivers flowing into the

                    Louisbourg. 4. By what course would fleets sailing from Boston have to go to
                    reach Quebec? 5. Let the pupil point out on a map the route to Canada and Quebec
                    by the way of Lakes George and Champlain. 6. Relative position of Georgia and

                    exasperating to Virginia, which claimed the western country. George Washington,
                    then a young man of twenty-one, who had already spent much time on the frontier
                    as a surveyor, was sent into the wilderness by the Governor of Virginia as an

                        impressed by Washington, and showed him many courtesies, though they tried
                        to persuade his Indians to leave him. On his return a French Indian tried to
                        kill him by firing at him, and then pretending that his gun had gone off
                        accidentally. The Indian was caught, and Washington's companion, Gist, would
                        have killed him, but Washington let him go. But he and Gist were obliged to
                        travel on foot all night and all the next day to avoid pursuit. They found
                        the Alleghany River filled with floating ice. They tried to cross on a raft,
                        but the ice caught the pole with which Washington was pushing and threw him
                        into the river. He caught hold of the raft and drew himself out. They were
                        obliged to pass the night on an island, and Gist was badly frost-bitten.
                        Washington got back to Williamsburg, the capital of Virginia, in January,
                        and the story of his adventures and of the French encroachments agitated the

                    Ohio, where Pittsburg now stands. This they called Fort Duquesne [du-ken].
                    Washington found the French too strong for his force, but, by surprising and
                    defeating a skulking party of them, he brought on the war, which the French
                    wished to postpone. Washington was himself afterward attacked by a superior

                    and brutal in manners. He could not understand the nature of a war in the woods.
                    Like other English officers of the time, he despised the American militia and

                    were unused to such warfare, and unable to do anything to repel the unseen foe.

                    cowardly, ordered them to "come out in the open field like Englishmen," and even

                    Washington, who was the only officer on Braddock's staff not killed or wounded,
                    behaved with admirable courage. He had two horses shot under him, and four
                    bullets pierced his clothes. Nearly all the officers of Braddock's army were
                    killed or wounded, and the soldiers who escaped the slaughter fled back to Fort

                    Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. It had been settled by the French about one
                    hundred years when the English conquered it in 1710, during Queen Anne's War.
                    The people were a very ignorant peasantry, who continued to speak French and to
                    take sides secretly with their own nation in every struggle between the two
                    countries, thought they had lived forty-five years under English rule. In this
                    war the hard resolution was taken to scatter the Acadians through the various
                    English colonies. They were seized and put on board vessels and sent away; their
                    houses and barns were burned, and their lands confiscated. Some of them got to
                    Louisiana, some to Canada, and some, after great hardships, made their way back
                    to Acadia; others were scattered in various places, and their suffering have

                            to the formation of companies of rangers, who fought the Indians in
                            their own way. Robert Rogers became very famous for his daring
                            expeditions in the region about Lake George. He had many desperate
                            fights with the French. He and his men journeyed on skates or snow-shoes
                            in winter, and in light whale-boats or afoot in summer. His main objects
                            were to capture prisoners for information and to annoy the enemy. Once,
                            with fifty men, he carried his light whale-boats six miles over a
                            mountain-gorge, from near the middle of Lake George to the waters of
                            Lake Champlain, and then rowed with muffled oars under the French fort
                            at Ticonderoga, so close as to hear the sentries give the watchword, and
                            then passed the fort at Crown Point in the same way. He captured and
                            sunk two sloops laden with provisions, hid his boats, and got back afoot
                            to Lake George. Then he returned and reconnoitred Lake Champlain in his
                            boats, captured some prisoners, and again hid his boats. This time the
                            French found his boats, and sent out scouts to find some water-passage
                            by which the boats could have come into Lake Champlain, not suspecting
                            that they could have been carried over. Rogers, with five men, once
                            walked coolly up to a sentinel near the French fort. When challenged, he
                            answered in French. Then, when he had demanded, in amazement, "Who are
                            you?" He answered, "Rogers," and took him prisoner. There is a tradition
                            that, in escaping from the Indians, he threw his packs down a steep rock
                            to the ice on Lake George, and then turned round on his snow-shoes and
                            walked away. The Indians, seeing the tracks, believed that two men had
                            slid down the frightful slope. The place is still known as "Rogers's
                            Slide."</p>

                    fortress frowned on them from its inaccessible heights. In several attacks, made
                    at various points, the English were repulsed. As the season of storms was coming
                    on, and the fleet must soon leave, even Wolfe began to despond. But, in spite of

                    to fight in the woods. They loaded their guns lying on the ground, and they
                    fired from behind trees and stumps, now running forward and now retreating and
                    charging again. The regular troops took no definite aim, but fired at the
                    enemy's line, while the colonists were the best marksmen in the world, and the
                    man whom one of them covered with his gun was generally doomed. In the first
                    siege of Louisbourg their deadly aim at last rendered it impossible for the
                    French to load or fire a cannon. Though without experience, thy had plenty of
                    courage. At the battle of lake George it was said that the American provincials
                    fought in the morning like good boys, about noon like men, and in the afternoon
                    like demons.</p>

                    they had used in hunting. The Americans made a bad show on parade, and refused
                    to fight standing up in close ranks. By the side of the neatly-kept, red-coated
                    British troops, the American militia looked shabby enough. The British officers
                    holding the king's commission assumed to command American officers of higher

                <p TEIform="p">The English troops were rather unfit for the work of fighting in the
                    woods. "Our clothes, our arms, our accouterments, even our shoes and stockings,
                    are all improper fro this country," wrote General Wolfe from America. Lord Howe,
                    who was one of the noblest of men and best of generals, changed the dress of his
                    men to fit them for marching in the woods. Hair was worn long in that day, and
                    Lord Howe cut off his own fine head of hair to persuade the men to sacrifice
                    theirs. He reduced the officers' baggage, and dismissed the great company of
                    washerwomen, setting a good example by washing his own linen in the brook. Lord
                    Howe cultivated the friendship of the American officers, and treated the
                    soldiers with great respect. He was second in command to Abercromby, and was
                    killed in a skirmish just before the attack on Ticonderoga. The defeat of
                    Abercrom by in the battle which followed is attributed to the loss of Lord Howe,
                    who was the real soul of the army. (See the preceding chapter.)</p>

                    had massacred a family they escaped too swiftly for pursuit. The colonies were
                    driven to offer rewards for the scalps of Indians as they were accustomed to pay
                    for wolves' heads. One can see how barbarous their feelings were, however, <note

                    butchering their own people. Another set of men, some of whom were connected
                    with the government, sold provision to the French. Very many embarked in

                    merchant-ships of France. This was only a kind of lawful piracy. Many of the

                            thousands of captives carried to Canada was a little girl named Sarah
                            Gerrish. An Indian girl once tried to drown her by pushing her off a
                            precipice into the river, but she saved herself by catching hold of the
                            bushes. Once she was so weary that she overslept, and awoke to find
                            herself alone in the woods and covered with snow. She followed the
                            tracks of the Indians until she overtook them. Again, the Indians built
                            a great fire, and told her that she was to be burned, but she threw her
                            arms around her Indian master's neck and begged him to save her. She was
                            sold to the French in Canada, and kindly treated by them until she was
                            returned. In the fall of 1677 two men, White and Jennings, set out from
                            the Connecticut River for Canada, to redeem their wives and children
                            carried off by Indians. Without guides they paddled though Lake
                            Champlain and reached Canada. After seven months' absence they brought
                            back about twenty captives in all. The people sent hoses to meet them at
                            Albany and bring them into Hatfield, where they were received with the
                            greatest joy. One woman, when she got her children together, after
                            captivity, found one of her sons, a lad of eleven, an Indian in habits,
                            and not able to speak any but the Indian language; while a daughter of
                            fifteen, who had been educated in a Canadian convent, spoke nothing but
                            French. One Pennsylvanian got home just as the sale of his property at
                            auction had been completed, his neighbors having supposed him dead.
                            James smith, having endured six years of captivity among the Indians,
                            came home a few days after his sweetheart had married another man.</p>

                    the captives remained among the savages; one Indian village contained a hundred
                    white people carried away in childhood. These had forgotten how to speak
                    English. Some of the Indian tribes doubled their numbers in the last French war
                    by adopting white children. Three thousand, men, women, and children, were
                    carried into captivity from Pennsylvania and the provinces south of it in the
                    year 1756.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The colonies did not immediately have peace. The Indians of the
                    Western country hated the English, and the occupation of the old French forts by
                    small English garrisons excited their jealousy. Under the lead of Pontica, on
                    Ottawa chief, a great conspiracy was formed in 1763, the year of the peace. The
                    garrisons of many of the smaller forts were massacred. Detroit and Pittsburg
                    were attacked, and the families on the frontier suffered horrible inroads from
                    the saves. In became necessary to march forces into the Indian country. General
                    Bouquet, with five hundred men, defeated a large force of Indians in a desperate
                    two days' battle at Bushy Run, in Pennsylvania, in 1763. "Pontica's War," as it
                    was called, was brought to a close in 1764, and the frontiers had a brief rest.
                    But already there were seen the beginnings of that great quarrel of the
                    Americans with the mother-country which brought on the bitter struggle of the

                    for the Revolution. But, before we consider the events which led to the
                    separation of the colonies from England, it will be best to ask, How were the
                    colonies governed at the close of the French wars? There were three forms of
                    government in America"royal," "charter," and "proprietary."</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">Three forms of government in the colonies.</p>
                </note>
                <p TEIform="p">The oldest colony, Virginia, was under what was called a royal
                    government, because the king appointed the governor, and approved or disapproved
                    of the laws that were passed. "Royal" means belonging to the king. New York had
                    been granted to the duke of York as a proprietary government, but when that duke
                    became king, as James II, it became a royal, or king's province. New Jersey
                    became a royal colony after the king bought the right of the proprietors. The
                    two Carolinas were proprietary governments at first, but in 1729 the king bought
                    out the proprietary rights, and they became royal governments. Georgia was first
                    settled under a body of twenty-one trustees, but in 1752 these trustees
                    surrendered the government to the king. In 1679 New Hampshire was separated form
                    Massachusetts, and became a royal colony. So that, after 1752, there were seven
                    colonies under royal governments, namely, Virginia, New York, New Jersey, North
                    and South Carolina, Georgia, and New Hampshire.</p>

                    governed by their own people, according to charters granted by the king.
                    Massachusetts, after it lost its first charter, had a governor appointed by the
                    king, but the power remained mostly in the hands of the legislature. Maine was
                    attached to Massachusetts.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Maryland had been given to Lord Baltimore, Pennsylvania to Williams
                    Penn. Baltimore and penn were called "proprietors," or "proprietaries." The
                    heirs of these first proprietors exercised in these two colonies power somewhat
                    similar to those of the king in the royal colonies. These were called
                    proprietary government. Delaware had been ceded to Penn by the Duke of York,
                    and, though it had a separate Legislature, it was under the same governor as
                    Pennsylvania. There were, therefore, at the close of the French wars, three
                    proprietary governments Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Each of the thirteen colonies had a legislative body. These were
                    divided into tow houses. There was a lover house, or Assemble, elected by the
                    people. The members of the upper house, or Council, were generally appointed by
                    the king in the royal colonies, and by the proprietary in the proprietary
                    colonies. In the charter colonies governors and members of the Council were
                    elected by the Assembly.</p>

                    both houses of the Legislature. In nearly all of the colonies the people had no
                    voice in choosing the governor or the upper house of the legislature. The people
                    could not, there, fore, make laws which were not agreeable to the king or the
                    proprietary. There was, consequently, almost a continual quarrel between the
                    governors, acting under instructions from England, and the representatives of
                    the people.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">All laws regulating the trade between the colonies and with other
                    countries were made by the English Parliament. The colonies were obliged, often
                    much against their will, to admit negro slaves, brought in by English merchants.
                    They were forced to send nearly all their leading products to England for sale.
                    They were not allowed to but any European goods, except in England, and no
                    foreign ships were allowed to enter a port in this country. Laws were made to
                    discourage people in the colonies from making and trading in such things as were
                    made England. There were English laws against the manufacture of iron-ware and
                    woolen goods by the American. The colonists had many furs, and could make hats
                    very cheaply, but no hatter was allowed to send hats form one colony to another.</p>

                    governments were there in the colonies? What were they called? Which form of
                    government was Virginia under? Why was this form called "royal"? What does the
                    word "royal" mean? To whom had New York been granted? (When? See pages 47, 48.)
                    When did it become a royal province? How did New Jersey, which once belonged to
                    proprietors, become a royal colony? What kind of government did the tow
                    Carolinas have at first? In what year did the king buy out the proprietors? What
                    kid of governments did the Carolinas have after 1729? Under what king of a body
                    had Georgia been settled? What did the trustees of Georgia do in 1752? From what
                    colony was New Hampshire separated in 1679? What sort of a colony did it then
                    become? How many colonies were there under royal governments? What were their
                    names? (There were thirteen colonies in all: were the royal colonies more or
                    less than half of them?) How many colonies were under charter governments? What
                    three were they? How were the charter colonies governed? After Massachusetts had
                    lost its first charter, who appointed it governor? In whose hands did the power
                    mostly remain? Which one of our present States was at that time attached to the
                    governments of Massachusetts? To whom had Maryland been given? To whom had
                    Pennsylvania been given? What were Baltimore and Penn therefore called? What
                    powers did their heirs exercise in their colonies? What were their governments
                    called? What colony had been ceded to Penn by the Duke of York? What is said of
                    the government of Delaware? How many proprietary governments were there? Name
                    them. What did each of the thirteen colonies have? How many "houses" were there
                    in each Legislature? How were the members of the Assembly chosen? Who appointed
                    the members of the Council, or upper house, in a royal colony? Who appointed
                    them in a proprietary colony? How were they generally chosen in a charter
                    colony? What was necessary in order to pass a law in one of the colonies? How do
                    our ways of making laws at the present time resemble this? But what is the
                    difference? Who elects the governor now? What part of the State Legislature is
                    elected by the people now? Did the people of the colonies choose their own
                    governors? Did they choose they choose the upper house of the Legislature? What
                    kind of laws could they not make? What was the result of this arrangement? What

                    the great disgust of King James. When Sir John Harvey was governor of Virginia,
                    he opposed the people, and the Council deposed him in 1635, and sent him to
                    England. King Charles I was offended at their presumption in deposing a royal
                    governor, and he sent him back again as governor. But the people succeeded in
                    having him removed in 1639.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Sir William Berkeley, the royal governor of Virginia, opposed the
                    people, and in 1676 refused to allow them to make war on the Indians, who were
                    ravaging the frontiers. This he did, lest the large profits he was making out of
                    the fur-trade should be reduced. The people of the frontier put themselves under
                    the lead of a brilliant your man, Nathaniel Bacon by name. He forced the
                    governments to give him a commission, and he got the Legislature to pass some
                    good laws, that were much needed.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">Nathaniel Becon belonged to a family prominent in the county of
                        Sufiolk, in England. He was educated in the law at Cambridge. His habits,
                        like those of other young gentlemen of the time, were extravagant, and he
                        exceeded the allowance made him by his father. About 1673 he went to
                        Virginia, where he had a cousin, also named Nathaniel Bacon, who was rich
                        and childless, and who wished to make to younger Nathaniel heir to his
                        fortune, if he could have persuaded him not to embrace the popular cause.
                        But the generous heart of the younger Bacon was touched with the wrongs of
                        the people, and, though he had been appointed a member of the governor's
                        council, he yielded to the request of the people and became their leader. He
                        showed excellent ability, and he was idolized by the people, who stood guard
                        day and night over his house lest he should be assassinated. In fighting the
                        Indians he caused his men to stand so close to their fort that they could
                        fire though the portholes, and yet, by standing at one side, escape the fire
                        of the Indians. When, with a little handful of men, he marched swiftly on
                        Jamestown, which was garrisoned by five times as many, the people brought
                        food out into the road to refresh his soldiers, and the women cried after
                        him, "General, if you need help, send for us!" He treated his enemies with
                        gentleness, but he pushed his measures with vigor. When he died, his body
                        was secretly buried by his friends, by sinking it in the waters of the
                        river, in order that his enemies might not dig up his bones. The only
                        document to be found that appears to have been written by Bacon's own had is
                        signed "Nathaniel Bacon, General, by consent of the people." So that he was
                        something of a republican, though he lived a hundred years before the
                        Revolution.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Then he marched against the Indians and drove them back. On his
                    return, hearing that Berkeley had determined to arrest him, he marched straight
                    on Jamestown, and, thought his force was not a fourth part so numerous as that
                    in the town, he laid siege to it, captured it, and burned it to the ground.
                    Governor Berkeley fled to the Eastern Shore of Chesapeake Bay, and the people of
                    Virginia, except the few on the eastern side of the bay, took an oath to support
                    Bacon, hailing him as a deliverer. But Bacon was worn out by the cares and
                    exposures of the Indian war and the James-town siege, and he soon died. Berkeley
                    succeeded after a while in reducing Bacon's followers, and in confiscating for
                    his own use much of their property. Twenty-three leading men he put to death.
                    For this severity the king recalled him in disgrace.</p>

                    charter of the Massachusetts Companry (see pages 40, 41), an attempt was made to
                    destroy that charter by the same kind of a lawsuit that had been used to destroy
                    the charter of Virginia Company. But the Massachusetts charter had been carried
                    to America, and, when the judges in England sent orders to have it brought back
                    to be examined, the rulers of the colony made excuses until the troubles in
                    England caused the matter to be laid aside.</p>

                    New York and New England. He was a tyrant, who tried in every way to overthrow

                    people of New England were exasperated to the highest pitch, and when they heard
                    that the Prince of Orange had landed in England, to overthrow James II, they
                    rose against Andros and imprisoned hi, establishing a government of their own.
                    This was in 1688.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">During the time that Andros was governor of all New England, he had
                    tried to carry off the Connecticut charter. But it is said that, when the
                    charter was brought in and laid on the table, the lights were suddenly blown
                    out, and when they were lighted the charter was gone. It had been taken away and
                    hidden in the hollow of an oak-three. This three stood for nearly a hundred and
                    seventy years after, and was always respected as "the Charter Oak."</p>

                    against his lieutenant, and set up Captain Jacob Leisler for governor. Leisler,
                    who governed the colony of more than two years, was a plain merchant, with no
                    knowledge of government. He was bitterly opposed by the rich men of the colony.
                    Though a man of patriotism, he was imprudent, and, after the arrival of a royal
                    governor, his enemies succeeded in having him executed for treason.</p>

                    house, at any time, for the purpose of finding smuggled goods. This produced a
                    great excitement, and made the navigation laws still more unpopular. The trial
                    which took place about these writes was a kind of beginning of the quarrel which
                    brought on the Revolution fourteen years afterward.</p>

                            He was chiefly educated in a school taught by his father. He read law
                            and began the practice of his profession. In 1763 he was engaged to
                            plead in defense of the people against a suit of the parish clergy. It
                            was known as "The Parsons' Cause." Before a court, in which his own
                            father was the presiding magistrate, he pleaded the case of the people
                            with such extraordinary eloquence and vehemence that the clergymen rose
                            and left the room, and Henry's father wept tears of triumph, while the
                            people carried the your lawyer about on their shoulders. Elected to the
                            Virginia Legislature, he immediately took the lead against the Stamp Act
                            and became famous. It was in his speech on the Stamp Act that he uttered
                            the famous words, "Cesar had his Brutus, Charles the First his Cromwell,
                            and George the Third" As Henry reached this point his opponents cried
                            "Treason! treason!" But the speaker finished by saying, "may profit by
                            their example," and added, "if that be treason, make the most of it!"
                            When pleading for the organization of the Virginia militia, before the
                            Revolutionary War had begun, he closed with these memorable words: "Is
                            life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of
                            chains and slavery? Forbid it, almighty God! I know not what course
                            others may take, but as for me, give me liberty of give me death!" He
                            was several times governor of Virginia. He died in 1799.</p>

                    the American colonies. Parliament passed, in 1765, what was known as "The Stamp
                    Act." This law required that all bills, notes, leases, and many other such
                    documents used in the colonies, should be written on stamped paper, which should
                    be sold by officers at such prices as should bring a revenue to the English
                    government. All newspapers were require to be printed on stamped paper.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The American people quickly saw that, if the British Parliament could
                    pass such an act, they could tax America in any other way. The cry was raised in
                    all the colonies, "No taxation without representation!" Patrick Henry, a
                    brilliant speaker, took the lead in the agitation in Virginia, and James Otis,
                    an eloquent Boston lawyer, was the principal orator in Massachusetts. The
                    rivalries and jealousies between the various colonies died out in the new
                    patriotic feeling, and the excitement ran like a flame of fire form New
                    Hampshire to Georgia. There was everywhere a call for union among the colonies.

                            Cod, in 1725. After studying in his native town he went to Harvard
                            College, where he graduated when he was eighteen years old. But, wishing
                            to lay a good foundation, he spent a year and a half, more in general
                            studies before he entered on the study of the law. He practiced at first
                            in Plymouth and afterward in Boston. He rose to the highest rank in his
                            profession. He was an honorable man, and would never take unfair
                            advantages of an opponent. When the custom-house officers applied for
                            "writs of assistance," which would enable them to search any house at
                            any time, it became the duty of Otis, as advocate-general, to argue in
                            favor of the writs. But he gave up this lucrative office and took the
                            side of liberty. He made a great speech, five house long, against the
                            writs, and this speech is considered by some the starting-point of the
                            Revolution. It was in this speech that he first raised the popular cry
                            against "taxation without representation," which was the watchword of
                            the Revolution. In the great struggle over the Stamp Act, and in the
                            debates that followed, to 1769, he was the brilliant leader. When the
                            bitterness of the controversy with England was at its height he become
                            involved in a affray with several officers of the customs, and was
                            seriously injured. Soon after this his mind, wearied by the exciting
                            controversies in which he was engaged, became gradually deranged, and he
                            retired form public affairs. In 1783 he was killed by a stroke of
                            lightning.</p>

                    colony after colony violent mobs compelled the stamp-officers to resign. In some
                    places the people pulled down or rifled the houses of British official. Not one

                    they began to dress in homespun. They resoled, also, to eat no more mutton, in
                    order to increase the home production of wool. English merchants, whose trade
                    was hurt by these measures, now joined in the clamor for the repeal of the Stamp
                    Act, and it was repealed in 1766, to the great joy of the colonies.</p>

                    American plants. The English government sent over consignment of tea to the

                    sea. This is known as "The Boston Tea-Party." In New York the people emptied a

                    Concord, about twenty miles away. The Americans had formed companies ready to be
                    called out on the minute; these were called "Minute-men." At Lexington the

                        his mother was a woman of great force of character, but, like many ladies of
                        that day, she had little education. Washington got such education as the
                        poor country schools of the time afforded, but he made the most of it. His
                        exercise-books are models of method and neatness. Besides the common
                        branches of reading, writing, and arithmetic, he learned surveying and
                        book-keeping. He was a lad of great strength, and took the lead in all
                        athletic sports, and he became, one of the best horsemen of his time. He
                        bore hardships with great resolution, he spoke the truth, he was economical,
                        industrious, and systematic in his habits. He was, while yet hardly more
                        than a boy, engaged in surveying wild lands for Lord Fairfax, an English
                        nobleman, who owned a great tract of Virginia territory, and lived in the
                        Shenandoah Valley. He thus came to know the frontier country and the habits
                        of the Indians. He was made a major of the militia at nineteen, and he was
                        but twenty-one when Governor Dinwiddie sent him on a mission to the French
                        posts on the Ohio, as we have told in another chapter. By his prudent
                        conduct in Broddock's and Forbes's expeditions, and in the defense of the
                        Virginia frontier, he won the confidence of the American people. He was a
                        member of the Continental congress of 1774. He was not a brilliant man, but
                        even in 1774 Patrick Henry pronounced him, for "solid information and sound
                        judgment, unquestionably the greatest man" on the floor of the Continental
                        Congress.</p>

                    On the fourth day of July, 1776, the Continental congress adopted the
                    "Declaration of Independence." This act was formal separation of the united
                    colonies from England, whose king was no more to be king in the thirteen
                    colonies. Thomas Jefferson, of Virginia, wrote this eloquent declaration, which

                            His father was a noted land-surveyor, and one of the authors of a map of
                            Virginia. He left an ample fortune. Thomas was an eager student. He
                            graduated at William and Mary College, and was soon recognized as
                            perhaps the most accomplished general scholar in the colonies. He was an
                            excellent mathematician, and knew Greek, Latin, French, Spanish, and
                            Italian. There was almost no knowledge that he was not eager to acquire.
                            He was not gifted as an orator, but with his eloquent pen he rendered
                            great services to the cause of liberty in America. He wrote the
                            Declaration of Independence, the most famous state-paper in the world.
                            He used his best endeavor to have slavery and the slave-trade abolished.
                            He took the lead in abolishing the colonial laws that gave to the oldest
                            son the largest share of the father's property. He was also the leader
                            in separating church and state, and giving to the people religious
                            freedom. To him we own the charge of our money form pounds, shillings,
                            and pence to a simple decimal system of dollars, dimes, and cent. To

                            Mississippi. He was the third President of the United States, chosen in
                            the year 1800, and was elected for a second term in 1804. He died on the
                            4th of July, 1826, just fifty years to a day from the adoption of the
                            Declaration of Independence, and the aged John Adams, second President,
                            died on the same day.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">The Marquis de La Fayette was born of an illustrious French
                        family on the 7th of September, 1757. He was but nineteen years old, with
                        every prospect which great wealth and family influence could give, when he
                        embraced the cause of liberty in America. Against the command of the King of
                        France, he freighted a ship at his own expense, and landed in America in
                        1777, to offer his services as a simple volunteer. He quickly won the favor
                        of Congress and the life-long friendship of Washington. He was made
                        major-general, and though so young, showed considerable ability as a
                        commander. His conduct was always prudent. He was wounded at the Brandywine,
                        and he distinguished himself by a masterly retreat from Barren Hill and fine
                        conduct at the battle of Monmouth. In Virginia, when Cornwallis threatened
                        him with a superior force, and boasted that the "little boy," as he called
                        La Fayette, could not get away from him, the young marquis avoided a battle,
                        and prepared by his skillful movements for the final success at Yorktown. La
                        Fayette was all his life a lover of liberty and order. He took a brave part
                        in the French Revolution, but refused to go to extremes. He was arrested and
                        imprisoned for years in Austria, in spite of American efforts to relieve
                        him. At the instance of Bonaparte he was freed in 1797. He visited the
                        United States in 1824, when he was welcomed as the guest of the nation. He
                        made the tour of the country, rejoicing in its prosperity. He was everywhere
                        received with enthusiasm by those whose fathers he had helped in their hour
                        of distress. Congress voted him $200,000 and a township of land for his
                        losses and expenses in the Revolution. Though an old man, he took part in
                        the French Revolution of 1830, and remained the devoted friend of human
                        liberty until his death in 1834.</p>

                    Washington went into winter-quarters at Valley Forge. Congress had no money.
                    Many of the soldiers were without shoes, and in their marches over frozen ground
                    they left blood in their tracks. Some of the poor fellows sat up by the fires at
                    night, for want of blankets to keep them warm.</p>

                    Europe. Many foreign officers had come over to assist the Americans. Some of

                    America, partly from a jealous dislike of England, partly from the love of
                    liberty that was growing among the French people. The courageous persistence
                    with which Washington attacked Howe's army at Germantown made a strong
                    impression in France, and on the 30th of January, 1778, a treaty of alliance
                    between France and the united States was signed. This was received in America
                    with the greatest joy.</p>

                    Philadelphia. Sir Henry Clinton, who had succeeded Howe in command of the
                    British army, was afraid that the French might blockade the Delaware, and thus
                    shut him up in Philadelphia. He therefore retreated across New Jersey to New
                    York, pushed by Washington's army. During this retreat the battle of Monmouth
                    was fought. The Americans gained a partial victory, the English retreating under
                    cover of night.</p>

                    slaves, and as the white population was more scattered, in the Southern States,
                    they supposed it might be easier to overrun them. At the close of the year 1778
                    the British captured Savannah, and Georgia was soon subjugated. In the next year
                    an attempt was made by the Americans, assisted by the French fleet, to capture
                    Savannah, but it failed. In this attempt Count Pulaski lost his life. After a
                    regular siege, a British fleet and army took Charleston in May, 1780. General
                    Gates, who had commanded the Northern army when Burgoyne surrendered, was put in
                    command of all the American troops at the South. But Gates was utterly beaten,
                    and his whole army routed and dispersed, by the British under Cornwallis, at the
                    battle of Camden, in South Carolina. There was no longer any American army
                    worthy of the name in the whole South.</p>

                        of a crescent, was shot away. A sergeant named Jasper leaped down outside

                        governor of South Carolina gave him his own sword. In 1779 he was engaged in
                        the attack on Savannah, when the colors of his own regiment were shot away.

                    accounts, and had been once sentenced to be publicly reprimanded. Arnold opened
                    a correspondence with the British general, and afterward got himself appointed
                    to the command of the posts in the Highlands of the Hudson in order to betray
                    them. Major Andre [an-dray], of the British army, was sent to arrange with
                    Arnold the surrender of these posts. On his way back to New York Andre was
                    captured by three men who refused all the rewards which he offered them, and
                    delivered him and his papers, which were in Arnold's handwriting, to the nearest
                    American officer. Andr was tried and hanged for a spy. Arnold had time to escape
                    to the British army, in which he fought with great vindictiveness against the
                    Americans. He afterward lived in England, detested by everybody as a traitor.</p>

                    under Morgan defeated a British force under Tarleton. Greene skill fully

                    was forced to begin a prompt retreat to the sea-coast, leaving his wounded in

                        <p TEIform="p">Benjamin Franklin. Franklin was the son of a tallow-chandler,
                            and was born in Boston in 1706. He learned the printer's trade in his
                            brother's office, and also did some rude engraving for the paper. He was
                            studious from child-hood. He went to Philadelphia at seventeen and
                            worked as a journeyman printer. After many vicissitudes he rose to the
                            ownership of a printing-office. He published an almanac, known as "Poor
                            Richard's," that became famous for its wise proverbs, and he printed and
                            edited the best newspaper in the American colonies. He became a student
                            of electricity, and in 1752, by means of a kite, he proved that the
                            lightning of the clouds was electricity. This discovery, and the
                            invention of the lightning-rod, made him famous. He promoted the
                            formation of literary institutions, and furthered the public welfare in
                            many ways. He went to London more than once as agent for his own and
                            other colonies, and was chiefly influential in securing the repeal of
                            the Stamp Act. He was in London as agent for several of the colonies
                            when the Revolution broke out, but he immediately returned to America.
                            He was one of the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence. He
                            went to France in 1776 as ambassador, and it was his skillful hand that
                            negotiated the treaty with that country, without which the Revolution
                            could hardly have succeeded. He assisted in making the treaty of peace
                            with England in 1782, and took part in framing the Constitution of the
                            United States in 1787. He died in Philadelphia in 1790, aged eighty-four
                            years. It was said of him that "he wrested the thunder from the sky and
                            the scepter from tyrants."</p>

                    American colonies had no navy. It was quite impossible for them to form a navy
                    that could contend with that of England, which was the best in the World. But
                    the Americans of that time were a sea-coast people, who did nearly all their
                    trading and traveling by water. They quickly fitted up some ships, that did good
                    execution. At the outbreak of the war the American army lacked powder, arms, and
                    clothing. While powder-factories were building, daring American seamen, North
                    and South, put to sea and captured supplies of powder from British ships. In
                    1776, ten thousand suits of winter uniform, on their way to Burgoyne's army,
                    were captured. These were sent to cloth the destitute American soldiers.</p>

                    troops suffered much from a scarcity of the necessaries of life. Then, too, a
                    private soldier in that day was liable to punishment by flogging and other
                    degradations not relished by most Americans. But many of the people were always
                    ready to fight in an irregular way. The armies were often broken, but the people
                    were not subdued. The farmer-militia usually wore brown tow-shirts and carried
                    long fowling-pieces. Their ammunition was carried in powder-horn and shot-bag.</p>

                    time. The percussion-cap had not yet been invented, but the old firelocks,
                    touched off by a burning fuse, had all disappeared. The small-arms were probably
                    all flint-locksguns and pistols that were set off by a flint striking a piece of
                    steel. There were no breech-loaders and no revolvers. Firing was much slower and
                    less effective than now. The bayonet was more important then than in recent
                    warfare.</p>

                    ground when they marched. To relieve the necessities of the soldiers, patriotic

                    the wealth also increased. The loss of credit and the inefficiency and suffering
                    of the army were principally due to the weakness of the government. There were,
                    indeed, thirteen governments, bound together very loosely. Congress had no way
                    of making each State pay its proportion of the expense of the war, and so one
                    State waited for another. It was not until some years after the peace that a

                <p TEIform="p">At the beginning of the Revolution the different colonies were
                    governed under charters of one kind or another from the king, as we have seen in

                    of them adopted constitutions which established governments very much like those
                    they had been accustomed to. The chief difference was, that the authority of the
                    king was not recognized in the new government.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Congress of the Colonies was yet only a congress of men
                    representing thirteen different allied countries, for each State assumed to act
                    as an independent nation. A confederation was therefore proposed, which combined
                    all the states into one government for purposes of war and the regulation of
                    commerce. The Articles of Confederation were not accepted by all of the colonies
                    until 1781. This confederation left each State independent in the matter of
                    taxes. Much of the suffering of the American army during the Revolution came
                    from the lack of power in Congress to levy a tax without the assent of the
                    several States. The largest States had but one vote apiece in Congress; the
                    smallest had the same. This made a wretchedly weak government, which was soon
                    held in contempt at home and abroad.</p>

                    of the Revolution, until it became unbearable. In 1787 a convention met in
                    Philadelphia, to form a constitution better suited to give strength to the
                    nation. George Washington, who had retired to private life when the war was
                    over, was chosen president of this convention.</p>

                    was intrusted chiefly to committees of its own members. But the new Constitution
                    made an almost complete separation of the government into three parts, each of
                    which is confined to its own duties.</p>

                    States. In the House of Representatives the States have a greater or less number
                    of members, according to their population. In the Senate each State has two
                    members. A bill must get a majority of votes in both the House of
                    Representatives and the Senate, in order to become a law. It must also be
                    approved by the President. But, if the President refuses to sign it, then two
                    thirds of both the Senate and the House may pass it, and it becomes a law in

                    new nation and the whole country turned its eyes to one man. General Washington,
                    who had been for five years living quietly on his plantation at Mount Vernon,
                    was the only person thought of for President, and he was elected without a
                    rival. John Adams was chosen Vice-President.</p>

                    four millions of people. The single State of New York has a larger population
                    than the, whole country had in Washington's time, and Pennsylvania also has
                    more, while Ohio and Illinois have each nearly as many. The census of 1890, when
                    it comes to added up, will doubtless show that in one hundred years the
                    population has increased to more than seventy millions, or to a least eighteen
                    times as many as there were when the first census was taken in 1790.</p>

                    Constitution made the States one nation, were settled chiefly along the Atlantic
                    coast. The center of population was east of Baltimore, on the eastern shore of
                    the Chesapeake Bay. This shows how closely the people clung to the sea, which
                    was almost the only great highway <note type="margin" place="unspecified"

                    into the country, one found the population becoming more sparse, and the houses
                    generally mere cabins. By the time one reached the Alleghany Mountains, there
                    was an end of settlements. All to the west of the mountains was a wilderness,
                    filled with hostile savages and wild beasts, except the little pioneer
                    settlements in Kentucky and Tennessee. The western line of the territory of the
                    United States was the Mississippi River, but the unbroken forests and prairies
                    of that region seemed about as far away as the interior of Alaska does to-day.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The people of the first years of the republic had neither railroad
                    nor steamboat. One of the commonest modes of travel from one town to another was
                    by sailing the length of the voyage; all depended on wind and weather.
                    Stage-wagons were also run between the larger towns. It took six days to make
                    the journey from Boston to New York, and two or three to get from New York to
                    Philadelphia. A journey required as many days then as it does hours now.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Many travelers made journeys in their own coaches or in light
                    two-wheeled vehicles. The ferries were a terror to these. Large rivers were
                    usually crossed in rude scows, and not without danger, but at some places it was
                    necessary to swim the horses over and float the carriage at the stern of a
                    canoe.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Probably the most comfortable of all modes of travel at the time was
                    that of riding on horse back. In America only were there horses that ambled
                    naturally. The "natural pacer," of Virginia, and the "Narragansett pacer," of
                    Rhode Island, were highly prized, and were <pb id="VAA2336-219" n="205"
                        TEIform="pb"/> matters of wonder even in Europe. Two people often traveled
                    with one horse. The first rode ahead and tied the horse by the road; the second,
                    when he came up, rode on past his companion and in turn tied the horse and left
                    him for the other. This was called "traveling ride and tie."</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When Washington became President, all the chief towns were on the
                    sea-coast, or on the tide-water of the rivers, except Lancaster, in
                    Pennsylvania. Outside of that State, the roads were so bad that a large
                    trading-town was not possible away from water conveyance. The interior trade of
                    Pennsylvania was carried on in great wagons, known as Conestoga wagons, each
                    drawn by six or eight stout horses. There were ten thousand or more of these
                    wagons running out of Philadelphia. The wagon-trade with the interior made
                    Philadelphia the chief town of North America. Trade with remote districts of the
                    country was still carried on by means of pack-horses and <hi rend="i"
                        TEIform="hi">bateaux</hi>, or small boats.</p>

                    and no speed, so that news sent by mail almost became history by the time it
                    reached the reader. The newspapers were published weekly, and were slow with
                    their news and rather dull in their comments.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">There were schools in all the leading towns and cities. In New
                    England there were schools in almost every township. But there was no
                    public-school system like that which prevails at present. The schools were, for
                    the most part, poor; the discipline in them was severe, and sometimes brutal.
                    Boys were taught to read and write, and sometimes to "cast accounts." Girls
                    learned to read, sometimes also to write. But needle-work and fancy-work were
                    thought more appropriate to them. The oldest college in the country was Harvard,
                    at Cambridge, Massachusetts. The next oldest was the college of William and
                    Mary, at Williamsburg, the capital of Virginia. Yale College, in New Haven, was
                    the third in age. There was also a college in New York, one in Philadelphia, and
                    another in Princeton, New Jersey.</p>

                    cutting down forests and building new towns have no time to write books or paint
                    pictures. The early books were almost all on politics or religion. But in the
                    fifty years before the Revolution there came to be a considerable interest in
                    science and literature. One American, Benjamin Franklin, became famous in Europe
                    as well as in America by his great discovery <pb id="VAA2336-221" n="207"
                        TEIform="pb"/> that the lighting of the clouds was but ordinary electricity.
                    Franklin was also an admirable thinker and writer on many subjects, and one of
                    the greatest men of his century. Three Americans, Copley, West, and Stuart,
                    gained reputation in England as painters, but America could furnish only a
                    slender support to artists.</p>

                    States, in the time of President Washington, have no railroads and no
                    steamboats, but they lacked a great number of other conveniences. Telegraphs and
                    telephones were unknown. Electric lights are an invention of our own time, but
                    our ancestors did not even have gas or kerosene-oil. Lamps of any kind were
                    almost unknown; houses were lighted with tallow-candles, though some of the
                    people made wax-myrtle tree. The poorest people burned a wick in a vessel
                    containing a little grease, or lighted pieces of pitch-pine on the hearth. With
                    such lights, it was no great virtue that they went to bed early. Even the
                    streets of large towns were lighted with dim lanterns. Stoves for heating were
                    almost unknown; those for cooking were not yet dreamed of. Wood was the only
                    fuel used in houses. Blacksmiths burned charcoal.</p>

                    prepared and spun at home, and then woven into plain homespun cloths for men's
                    and women's wear. The greater part of the people were farmers, and <pb
                        id="VAA2336-224" n="210" TEIform="pb"/> the farmer rarely spent money. What
                    his family ate and wore was produced at home. The rough shoes worn in winter
                    were, perhaps, bought of a neighboring cobbler, but they were sometimes made at
                    home. The children and, in many cases; the parents themselves, went barefoot in
                    summer. Many plows, wagons, and sleds were made on the farm. In many parts of
                    the country the plow was unknown, and the pack-horse or rude sledge took the
                    place of the wagon. The farming was generally of the roughest kind, but the land
                    was new and fertile.</p>

                    buckskin leggins. These woodsmen lived by hunting, by trapping, by poling boats
                    and driving pack-horses, by small Indian trading, and sometimes by petty
                    farming. Until after the Revolution, mechanics and workingmen wore leathern

                    about one seventh were negro slaves. These slaves were found in every State
                    except Massachusetts and Maine, which was then a part of Massachusetts. But they
                    were few in the Northern States. Of the Northern States New York had the most
                    slavesmore than twenty thousand. Nearly seven eighths of all the slaves were in
                    Maryland, Virginia, and the two Carolinas. These were the lands of tobacco,
                    indigo, and rice culture.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">In these States country life preserved aristocratic forms. Here,
                    until after the Revolution, the oldest son of the family usually inherited the
                    land, according to the custom of the old English law. Some of the great planters
                        <pb id="VAA2336-225" n="211" TEIform="pb"/> lived like nobles. They were
                    accustomed to manage public affairs, and from this class came some of the most
                    eminent statesmen of the period following the Revolution. Virginia was called
                    "the Mother of Presidents." But the poorer people at the South had little or no
                    chance for education, and were generally rude and illiterate. There were few
                    towns in the Southern States, very few mechanics, and little of the
                    ship-building and manufactures that were soon to make New England rich. But in
                    Washington's time the Southern States were the richest as well as the most
                    populous. If they had but little town life, there was much social gayety in the
                    plantation-houses.</p>

                    adoption of the Constitution, were only what would now be counted towns of
                    moderate size. But in each of these little capitals there was an aristocracy
                    that affected the style and fashion of the English gentry. Gentlemen and ladies
                    gathered at fashionable houses in the afternoon, and spent the time in talking,
                    and sipping tea from dainty little china cups. Sometimes large parties rode down
                    to a public garden in the country, or a tavern by the sea-side, to drink tea. In
                    most of the chief towns there were held once in two weeks "assemblies," or
                    balls. At these assemblies there were stately minuets and country-dances and
                    much money was lost and won at card-tables in a room prepared for fashionable
                    gambling, which was then one of the recognized amusements of good society.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">The Federalist party had first taken its name in the struggle to
                    secure the adoption of the Constitution which that party favored. Federalists
                    were generally in favor <pb id="VAA2336-228" n="214" TEIform="pb"/> of
                    strengthening the central government. They also liked to see the government
                    conducted with some pomp and ceremony, after the English way. The Federalist
                    party was strong in the cities, and among people of wealth and those devoted to
                    commerce. Such people in that day were generally aristocratic in their feelings,
                    and leaned to English ways. In the war between England and France the sympathies
                    of the Federalists were in favor of England and against France.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The party opposed to the Federalists was called at first the
                    Republican and afterward the Democratic party. (It is not to be confounded with
                    the Republican party of our time.) The members of this party were afraid that
                    the central government would grow too strong, and perhaps overthrow the
                    liberties of the people. They wished to increase the power of the State and
                    diminish that of the United States. They cherished ideas of individual liberty
                    and equality, and were afraid of an aristocracy. The old Republican or
                    Democratic party of that day-sympathized with France, which had, in the great
                    Revolution of 1789, overthrown the monarchy and set up a republic, and the
                    Republicans disliked England. Many of them at one time showed their partisanship
                    by wearing the tricolored cockade worn by republicans in France. The Republican
                    party in America wished to bring in republican manners and simple tastes, and
                    they objected to the stately ceremonies which Washington and the Federalists
                    liked.</p>

                </note>
                <p TEIform="p">Alexander Hamilton. This great man was born in the Island of Nevis,
                    in the West Indies, in January, 1757. His father was poor, and he was put into a
                    counting-house. At fifteen years of age he wrote for the "St. Christopher's
                    Gazette" an account of a hurricane that had just desolated the Leeward West
                    India Islands. The remarkable ability of this description attracted the
                    attention of the chief men of the place, and the boy was sent to the American
                    continent to be educated. In 174, when but seventeen years of age, while a
                    student in King's College (now Columbia College), in New York, he made a speech
                    on the Revolutionary side at a great meeting in the fields, which at once
                    stamped him as a wonderful youth. He also wrote several anonymous pamphlets that
                    attracted great attention, and were attributed to the leading men of the party.
                    In 1776, when he was but nineteen, he took command of an artillery company, and
                    so distinguished himself at the battle of White Plains and in the retreat across
                    New Jersey that Washington put him on his own staff. He was employed by
                    Washington in many delicate and confidential missions, and he distinguished
                    himself in more than one battle. He led the assault on one of the British
                    outworks at Yorktown. His great work lay in his efforts to persuade the American
                    people to adopt the Federal Constitution, by which the national existence was
                    firmly established. As the first Secretary of the Treasury, he held Congress
                    firmly to the duty of paying every dollar of the national debt at its face. He
                    also prevailed on Congress to adopt the debts incurred by the States in carrying
                    on the war, and he thus established the credit of the nation. He retired from
                    office on account of poverty, but his law practice was afterward very
                    profitable. He was killed in a duel with Aaron Burr in 1804.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">During Washington's administration there began those troubles with
                    the Indian tribes which have plagued the government and the people of the
                    frontiers from that day to this. The English government refused to surrender
                    forts which it held among the Indian tribes in what is now Ohio, and encouraged
                    the savages, to hostilities. There arose in consequence a most deadly and cruel
                    was between the white settlers in Kentucky and the tribes living on the north
                    side of the river. More than fifteen hundred Kentucky settlers had been killed
                    in seven years, and very many carried away into a cruel captivity. The horrible
                    slaughter of men, women and <pb id="VAA2336-230" n="216" TEIform="pb"/> children
                    in Kentucky gave that State the name of "the Dark and Bloody Ground."</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Washington was greatly distressed at this defeat. He now selected
                    General Wayne, who had gained distinction in the Revolution, and whose courage
                    was such that he was called "Mad Anthony Wayne." But he was as prudent as he was
                    brave. The Indian called him "The Black Snake," and they also called him "The
                    Chief who never Sleeps." After trying in vain to make peace with the Indians,
                    Wayne attacked and defeated them, driving them from their hiding-places by a
                    bayonet-charge. This battle was fought in 1794, on the banks of the Maumee
                    River, in northern Ohio. It brought peace to the frontier for a while.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Anthony Wayne.General Wayne was born in Chester Country,
                    Pennsylvania, in 1745. He early showed a fondness for military life. He received
                    a good education for the time, and became a land-surveyor. During the troublous
                    times of 1774 and 1775 Wayne devoted himself to drilling military companies in
                    his own country. He entered the army as colonel in 1776, and distinguished
                    himself in many actions. His most notable exploit perhaps, was the storming f
                    Stony Point, on the Hudson. This formidable work he carried at midnight by a
                    bayonet-charge, the soldiers' guns being empty. He afterward handled a small
                    force in Georgia in such a way as to hold in check a much larger body of British
                    troops. It was his careful organization and blood execution of various
                    enterprises during the Revolution which caused his selection by Washington to
                    retrieve the fortunes of the Indian was after St. Clair's defeat. When he
                    returned from his successful expedition against the Indians he was received in
                    Philadelphia in triumph. He was sent in 1796 to receive the surrender of the
                    Western forts, and died in December of that year on the shore of Lake Erie.</p>

                </note>
                <p TEIform="p">There was about this time a rebellion in western Pennsylvania, known
                    as "the Whisky Insurrection." The people of western Pennsylvania raised Indian
                    corn. The roads over the mountains were such that they could not well haul this
                    corn to market, so they fell to making it into whisky, in which shape it was
                    less bulky and more easily carried. The new United States tax on <pb
                        id="VAA2336-232" n="218" TEIform="pb"/> whisky interfered with this
                    business, and the people rose against the revenue officers. Washington sent
                    troops to enforce the law, and the people submitted after the ringleaders of the
                    rebellion bad fled.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Washington declined to be a candidate for the third time, and in
                    September, 1796, the "Father of his Country" issued a farewell address, full of
                    good advice. At the end of his term, in March, 1797, he retired to Mount Vernon,
                    where he spent his closing years in peace. He died December 14, 1799, in the
                    last month of the eighteenth century. Of the many great men of that century, he
                    was, though not the most gifted, probably the most illustrious. The whole United
                    States paid honor to his memory, and to this time his is the only American
                    birthday honored as a public holiday.</p>

                    still in the hands of English troops certain military posts in the Indian
                    country which were within the territory of the United States. In violation of
                    the treaty, the English government retained these posts among the Indians, and
                    by the encouragement given to the tribes, kept alive the Indian war. When Wayne
                    defeated the Indians on the Maumee, as we have related in the preceding chapter,
                    he found Canadians fighting on the side of the Indians, and he drove them before

                <p TEIform="p">To prevent a new war with Great Britain, Washington sent John Jay to
                    England in 1794 to make a treaty. "Jay's Treaty," as it was called, was very
                    unpopular in America, especially with the members of the Republican party, who
                    thought that it yielded too much to England. But it was confirmed by Washington
                    and the Senate, for, according to the Constitution, every treaty made with a
                    foreign nation must be agreed to by the Senate. It provided for the surrender of
                    the Western forts by England, and it prevented a war with Great Britain, which
                    would have been a misfortune to so weak a country as ours <pb id="VAA2336-235"

                    last, in 1812, the United States had nearly twice as many people as it had when
                    the Jay treaty was made.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">This treaty with Great Britain was exasperating to the French
                    government, which was then engaged in war with England. As France had helped the
                    United States to gain its independence, the French expected the assistance of
                    America in their new war with England. Washington wisely kept this country free
                    from alliances with either of the contending nations.</p>

                    in 1735. He graduated at Harvard, taught school for two years, and began the
                    practice of law when he was twenty-three years of age. He took an active part in
                    the Stamp-Act agitations from 1765 onward. He removed to Boston in 1768, and
                    soon became a leading lawyer and a chief of the Revolutionary party. Adams was
                    one of the foremost men in the Congress of 1774 and 1775, and was one of the
                    committee to prepare the Declaration of Independence. He was one of the
                    commissioners to negotiate the treaty of peace with England, and was minister at
                    London for three years. He was Vice-President during the whole of Washington's
                    presidency, and in 1796 was elected to succeed Washington as President. He was
                    an able and courageous man, honest and true to his convictions, but vain,
                    irritable, the somewhat quarrelsome. His peculiarities had something to do with
                    his unpopularity and his defeat when he ran for the presidency a second time. He
                    died on 4th of July, 1826, exactly fifty years after the Declaration of
                    Independence.</p>

                    government called the "Directory." It was composed of five directors. The
                    successes which their armies achieved under the command of the rising young
                    general, Napoleon Bonaparte, made the Directory very overbearing. When the
                    United States sent a new minister to Paris, the French government refused to
                    receive him, and presently ordered him to leave the country.</p>

                    sent three envoys to France, having assurances that they would be received with
                    honor. But the American envoys were informed with honor. But the American envoys
                    were informed that, in order to secure a peace, the United States must make a
                    loan to the French government and pay secret bribes to the members of the

                    on by those in favour of a war with France. "Hail, Columbia," then a new song,
                    became universally popular. Ships were built, an army was raised, and Washington
                    was made commander-in-chief.</p>

                    begun the work of paying the national debt in full, and so ever did a better
                    work than the Federalists did in bringing a bankrupt and disorderly confederacy
                    into a firm union.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">But the Federalists leaned too much to the English notions of
                    government that had prevailed before the Revolution. The Republicans held more
                    to the equality of men; they trusted the people, and believed in progress toward
                    a larger personal liberty. The Federalist movement made us a nation; but the
                    movement represented by the old Republican party made us republicans and
                    Americans.</p>

                    President and Vice-President thus belonged to opposite parties.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">In 1800 the Republicans resolved to elect Jefferson President and
                    Aaron Burr Vice-President. But, as the only way of electing a Vice-Persident was
                    by voting for him as one of the two candidates for President, it happened that
                    both Jefferson and Burr received the votes of all the Republican electors, and
                    had, therefore, exactly the same number of electoral votes, although nobody had
                    thought of Burr for President. The Constitution provided then, as it does now,
                    that the choice between the two, in case of a tie-vote, should be by the House
                    of Representatives. The Federalists disliked Jefferson in particular, as the
                    great chief of the Republicans; the most of them, therefore, voted for Burr.
                    This produced a new tie in the House of Representatives, and there was danger
                    that the 4th of March would arrive and find the country without a President;
                    but, after a long <pb id="VAA2336-242" n="228" TEIform="pb"/> struggle, some of
                    the Federalists cast blank votes, and allowed Jefferson to be elected. This
                    dangerous struggle led to a change in the Constitution, by which the electors
                    were to vote for but one candidate for President and one for Vice-President.
                    This method of voting for electors still prevails.</p>

                    It was a period in which Americans were fond of dangerous exploits. The officers
                    and men of this small sea-force performed acts of daring before Tripoli which
                    have never been forgotten, and which yet serve for an example to their
                    successors. In many actions Americans boarded the pirate-ships, and fought in
                    desperate hand-to-hand encounters, with swords, pikes, <pb id="VAA2336-243"
                        n="229" TEIform="pb"/> and bayonets. The frigate Philadelphia, having run on
                    rocks, was captured by the Tripolitans, and the crew reduced to slavery.
                    Lieutenant Decatur ran into the harbor at night in a ketch, boarded the frigate
                    and burned her, escaping with his men by rowing his little boat under a storm of
                    fire from the enemy's batteries. After four years of blockade and war, tge
                    obstinate ruler of Tripoli was brought to terms. He made a treaty of peace in
                    1805.</p>

                    was sent to the Mediterranean Sea, in 1815, as commodore of a squadron. He
                    captured the chief vessels of the Dey, and forced that prince to release his
                    prisoners, and to come on board the commodore's ship and sign a treaty. The
                    United States never afterward paid tribute to any of the pirate powers.</p>

                    flat-boat was then broken up, and its planks used in building the settler's
                    cabin. Pennsylvania wagons, after a while, took the place of the pack-horse in
                    the journey over the mountains to Pittsburg.</p>

                    world. They raised flax and sometimes grew wool, and spun and wove at home.
                    Their spinning-wheels and looms were made by themselves. For chairs they made
                    rude stools, their tables and bedsteads <pb id="VAA2336-247" n="233"
                        TEIform="pb"/> were such as they could make, and they used wooden bowls for
                    dishes. They tanned their own leather, and made rude shoes at home. The husks of
                    Indian corn were used for making various articles, such as rope, horse-collars,
                    brooms, and chair-bottoms. Barrels and bee-hives were made by sawing hollow
                    trees into sections. By splitting one of these sections a child's cradle was
                    constructed. For tea they drank a decoction of sassafras-root or the leaves of
                    the crop-vine. Their sugar they got from the maple-tree. Their small boat was a
                    canoe made from a single log, or a pirogue [pee-rogue'], which was a canoe
                    enlarged by splitting it in the middle lengthwise and inserting a plank. The
                    danger from Indians was so great for many years that the settlers never went to
                    their fields without carrying their rifles.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Whatever supplies the Western settlers got, they brought from the
                    towns on the eastern side of the mountains, by means of pack-horses and wagons.
                    For these goods they exchanged furs, ginseng, and other light articles. The
                    produce of Western farms was too heavy to be packed across the mountains. It
                    could only be sold by floating it thousands of miles down the Ohio and
                    Mississippi Rivers to New Orleans. This was done in very large flat-boats, which
                    were rowed down the river with great sweeps, but could not be brought back
                    against the current. The flat-boat men got home by taking passage on ships
                    sailing from New Orleans to Virginia or Maryland, and then crossing the
                    mountains to Pittsburg.</p>

                    down, there were presently used the "bargee" and the "keel-boat," both of which
                    had sharpened bows, and could be toilsomely forced up against the <pb

                    walking along the shore. Four months were consumed in the voyage from New
                    Orleans to Pittsburg. The boatmen were rude and lawless, and navigation was
                    rendered dangerous by the Indians and highwaymen that infested the banks of the
                    rivers.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Louisiana Territory. The region about the mouth of the Mississippi
                    was first explored by La Salle (see page 117), and the first settlements in that
                    region were made by the French in 1699. In 1722 New Orleans was made the capital
                    of the colony. In 1727 wives were sent to the planters by the government, in
                    imitation of the plan adopted for peopling Virginia a hundred years earlier. In
                    762, after the English had taken Canada (Chapter XXIII), the province of
                    Louisiana was ceded to Spain. For a long time indigo was grown, but in 1974
                    sugar was successfully raised, and the colony was rendered prosperous at once.
                    There had been much trouble between Spain and the United States about the
                    navigation of the Mississippi, and the Western people wished to seize New
                    Orleans and the lower Mississippi, and the Western people wished to seize New
                    Orleans and the lower Mississippi. The United States desired to buy a portion of
                    Louisiana, but in 1800 Bonaparte procured its cession back to France. He
                    entertained, along with other dazzling schemes, the project of rebuilding the
                    French power in America. Monroe and Livingston were commissioned by President
                    Jefferson to buy from France, if possible, the small portion of Louisiana so
                    much desired by the United States, in order to secure the free navigation of the
                    Mississippi; but Napoleon surprised the American commissioners by offering to
                    sell the whole vast territory. French Louisiana included in whole or in part the
                    States of Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas, Nebraska,
                    Colorado, and the Territories of Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, and the Indian
                    Territorythat is to say, there are tat present twelve very large States and
                    Territories almost wholly made from Louisiana as brought from France in 1803.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Louisiana, which then included almost the whole region between the
                    Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains, had been ceded by France to Spain in 1762.
                    Spain wished to deny to our people the right to navigate the great river that
                    formed our western boundary, and epeople west of the Alleghanies wished our
                    government to seize the whole of Louisiana. In 1800 Louisiana was ceded back to
                    France. In 1803 two commissioners were sent to France by President Jefferson,
                    with instructions to buy for the United States, if possible, a part of
                    Louisiana, including New Orleans and the mouths of the Mississippi. But
                    Napoleon, <pb id="VAA2336-249" n="235" TEIform="pb"/> who then ruled France,
                    fearing that England would seize the territory, took a sudden resolution to sell
                    all of Louisiana to the United States. For this the United States paid fifteen
                    million dollars. By this purchase the country acquired a great deal more
                    territory than all she had before possessed, and there was opened to her the
                    prospect of becoming one of the greatest nations on the earth.</p>

                    Union, and to revolutionize a part of Mexico. He enlisted soldiers in Ohio, and
                    started down the river; but he was arrested and tried for treason. For want of

                    English government was involved on a long war with Napoleon, who had made
                    himself Emperor of the French, and had conquered a great part of western Europe.
                    During this war England was in need of seamen for the navy. The officers of the
                    English navy were allowed to impress British seamen from merchant-vesselsthat
                    is, to force them to serve on men-of-war. But England had also long claimed the
                    right to impress her own subjects when found on ships of other nations. Every
                    man born in Great Britain who sailed before the mast in an American vessel was
                    liable to be seized by an English man-of-war. More than this, English naval
                    officers were allowed to judge whether a man was a native of England or not, and
                    thousands of natives of America were impressed on British ships. It was very
                    exasperating to Americans to have their ships stopped on the high-seas and
                    searched, and their citizens forced to serve in the navy of a foreign power. But
                    England was all-powerful on the sea, and the United States had to bear with such
                    insults or give up sailing ships.</p>

                    powers issued one after the other became so severe at last that our ships could

                <p TEIform="p">If our country had been strong, it would not have borne such
                    outrages, but it was then far from being prepared for a war with England.
                    President Jefferson was very anxious to avoid war, and to go on paying off the
                    debt of the country, which was his leading purpose. The President thought that
                    the United Stated might get the offensive decrees repealed by stopping all its
                    trade with the outside world. An act was therefore passed in December, 1807,
                    forbidding the departure of vessels from American ports. This was known as "The
                    Embargo of 1807," or "Jefferson's Embargo." The embargo was the only very
                    unfortunate act of Jefferson's administration, which, up to this time, had been
                    most popular. It was like destroying our own commerce to keep others from
                    ruining it. While our ships rotted in port, English and New York suffered
                    heavily by the destruction of their commerce, and there were even some
                    hot-headed people in the Eastern States who talked of dissolving the Union. The
                    embargo was called a "terrapin policy," as though the country had pulled its
                    head and feet into its shell, as a terrapin does when frightened. The embargo
                    lasted about fourteen months. The law was repealed in 1809.</p>

                </note>
                <p TEIform="p">In 1811 the irritation of the American people against England was
                    increased by the outbreak of an Indian war in the Northwest. It was believed
                    that English agents furnished arms to the Indians and encouraged their hostility
                    to the settlers. The Indians were at this time under the control of the great
                    Shawnee chief Tecumseh and his brother, who was called "the Prophet," and who
                    pretended to speak by inspiration. In July, 1811, General Harrison, Governor of
                    Indiana Territory, fought a battle with the Indians at Tippecanoe and defeated
                    them, Tecumseh, who was absent when this defeat took place, afterward entered
                    the British service.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">Tecumseh and "the Prophet." These two Indians were brothers, born
                        at the same time, and of the Shawnee tribe. Tecumesh was a warrior, while
                        his brother wrought upon the superstitions of the Indians by falling into
                        trances and pretending to be a prophet. He carried about a string of sacred
                        beans and other objects of reverence. He and Tecumseh deserted their own
                        tribe and settled on the Wabash, where the fame of the prophet's visions
                        drew multitudes of Indians from various tribes to him. When any chief or
                        other influential man opposed the schemes of the brothers, the Prophet had
                        influence enough to have him put to death for witchcraft. Tecumseh took the
                        extreme ground that all the country belonged to all the tribes in common,
                        and that the tribes who had sold their lands to the white men had done what
                        they had no right to do. He wished to force the government to give up all
                        lands north of the Ohio. He traveled from tribe to tribe, trying to form a
                        confederacy of all. The battle of Tippecanoe was fought in his absence, and
                        the defeat of the Indians there deranged his plans. But the successes of the
                        British in the Northwest revived his scheme his scheme. He was made a
                        brigadier-general in the British army, and at the surrender of Detroit the
                        British general Brock put his own scarf on Tecumseh as a mark of
                        distinction. The wily Shawnee, though fond of this decoration, put the scarf
                        on Round Head, an older warrior of the Wyandott tribe. Tecumseh was killed
                        at the battle of the Thames, in Canada, in 1813. He was one of the ablest
                        men produced by the Indian race, and it is to his credit that he never
                        countenanced the barbarous custom of torturning prisoners.</p>

                    The generals appointed at first were mostly Revolutionary officers, too old to
                    be good commanders. They were selected for political reasons. The soldiers were
                    high-spirited, but undisciplined. They sometimes refused to obey a disagreeable
                    order, or to follow an unpopular commander; sometimes they turned about and went
                    home. They even threatened the life of a general whom they thought guilty of
                    cowardice.</p>

                    Canada proved a difficult task. Old General Hull, as we have seen, contrived to

                    neglected. The success of our soldiers was not doubted, but it seemed folly for
                    a few ships to encounter the navy of Great Britain, which was then completely
                    "mistress." Yet in the first year of the war the failures of the army under weak
                    officers were overwhelming, and the country was only saved from complete
                    discouragement by bold triumphs of the daring little navy.</p>

                    set fire to the Philadelphia, under the batteries of Tripoli (page 229). The
                    year was closed by the captured of a fourth man-of-war, the frigate Java. This
                    was effected by the Constitution, which was nicknamed "Old Ironsides." Under
                    three different commanders this ship won brilliant victories in the war.</p>

                    adventurous character of American life in that day had developed a spirit of
                    personal daring well suited to naval warfare. Such was the emulation of officers
                    that in boarding an enemy's ship they actually pulled one another back in some
                    instances, so eager was every one to get over the side of the hostile vessel

                    battle of Lake Erie, fought this year, Commodore Perry hung up for his signal
                    "Don't give up the ship!" the dying words of Lawrence. When his flag-ship was
                    riddled and disabled by the enemy, he got into a small boat and was rowed to
                    another vessel, standing upright while the enemy was raining shot about him.
                    Reaching the ship Niagara, he sailed down on the British line and broke it, and
                    at length compelled the whole fleet to surrender. "We have met the enemy, and
                    they are ouRstwo ships, two brigs, one schooner, and one sloop," Perry wrote to
                    General Harrison at the close of the battle.</p>

                        avoid a massacre, but the answer was that when the fort should be given up
                        there would not be found a man alive in it. Croghan shifted his six-pounder
                        from one angle to another, to give the impression that he had several heavy
                        guns. When the fort was assaulted at its weakest part, the Kentucky riflemen
                        opined a deadly fire. But the brave English soldiers at length reached the
                        ditch, and began to chop down the stockade. The six-pounder, which had been
                        double-loaded with grape-shot and slugs, and concealed where it covered the
                        whole ditch, was suddenly fired. Hardly a man of the assailing party
                        escaped, and the English army retreated the next morning. During the night
                        which followed, Crpgham's men, not daring to open the gate, let down water
                        to the wounded Englishmen outside and at length, by means of a trench,
                        brought them in and cared for them.</p>

                    States. British agents supplied these Indians with arms. Weathersford, like
                    Tecumseh, had a prophet to help him, who had been initiated into the office by
                    Tecumseh's brother. This chief, also, discouraged the barbarities of the
                    Indians, but he could not restrain them, and cruel outrages of torture and
                    massacre took place.</p>

                    Weathersford himself entered Jackson's tent and surrendered. This was in April,
                    1814. Jackson, from being a commander of volunteers, was now made a
                    major-general, and put in command of the troops in the Southwest.</p>

                    captured Pensacola, and dislodged the British. He then retired.</p>

                    British force. With an energy unsurpassed perhaps in modern history, he formed
                    an army out of the men and material within his reach, and built defenses against
                    the British approach. He formed companies of free colored men, and he even took
                    the convicts out of prison to make soldiers of them. After several preliminary
                    battles, the English endeavored to carry Jackson's works by storm on the 8th of
                    January, 1815. But Jackson's preparations were so through, that the enemy was
                    repulsed with a frightful loss of twenty-six hundred men. The Americans lost but
                    eight killed and thirteen wounded. Sir Edward Pakenham, the British commander,
                    was killed, and the attack on New Orleans was abandoned.</p>

                    this reason it was called "The New Hampshire Grants." New York claimed it also,

                    took with them their slaves, their agricultural habits, and their military

                    admitted to Union in 1792. The people of this country have generally emigrated
                    in pretty straight lines to the westward. As Virginians broke over the mountains
                    into Kentucky, so North Carolinians crossed in to the valleys of Tennessee.

                    the crushing defeat which Jackson inflicted on the British troops at New
                    Orleans, made the United States respected in Europe as it had never been before.
                    Emigrants began to flock to America. The peace with the Indians caused the
                    Mississippi Valley, then called "The Far West," to fill up rapidly. In more than
                    thirty years after the Revolution, only five States were added to Union; but the

                    Mississippi, between Tennessee and Louisiana, was admitted in 1817. Illinois,
                    west of Indiana, was admitted in 1818; and Alabma filled the gap between

                    made into States, and the State of Louisiana had been made out of the territory
                    which had been bought from France. But, by this time, a new State on the west of
                    the Mississippi River was knocking at the door of the Union. This was Missouri.
                    Over the admission of this State there was Missouri. Over the admission of this
                    State there was a great debate, lasting through three sessions of Congress.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">The cause of this debate was the fact that Missouri proposed to come
                    in as a slave State. The bringing of slaves into the United States had been
                    forbidden in 1808. The States north of the southern line of Pennsylvania <pb
                        id="VAA2336-274" n="260" TEIform="pb"/> had all, before 1820, taken measures
                    to free their slaves. The States south of the southern line of Pennsylvania,
                    having much of their wealth in slaves, and cultivating crops that seemed to
                    require their labor, had by this time mostly give up the thought of freeing
                    their slaves. So that there were now two classes of States in the Union: free
                    States and States having slaves. Each of these divisions of the Union was afraid
                    that the other would get control of the country. It had usually been the custom,
                    in admitting new States, to bring on one from the North and one from the South,
                    to keep the balance good.</p>

                    1787, the State north of the Ohio had all come in as free States; but those the
                    south of that river had been allowed to enter as slaveholding States. Louisiana
                    had been purchased as slaveholding territory, and was admitted as a salve State.
                    But now the question arose whether all the great region bought from France was
                    to be added to the Southern side of the scale. Missouri was west of the
                    Mississippi, and so far north as to seem to break into the line of free States.</p>

                    letting Missouri come in as a slave State, but slavery was at the same time
                    forever forbidden in the rest of the territory north of the southern line of
                    Missouri. Thus all the territory to the north and west of that State would be

                    place in the presidency of James Monroe, who was chosen to that office in 1816.
                    Monroe was a man of even temper, with very little party feeling, and with the
                    greatest desire to be just and to act wisely. He was very popular, and his
                    administration was called "the era of good-feeling." The Federal party being now
                    almost extinct, Monroe was re-elected in 1820 without any opposing candidate.</p>

                        Revolutionary army. He distinguished himself in several battles. He was
                        minister to France and to England, and was secretary of State when Madison
                        was President. He was inaugurated President March 4, 1817, and served eight
                        years. After leaving the presidency he was very poor. He died in New York on
                        the 4th day of July, 1831. He was the third President to die on the 4th of
                        July.</p>

                        was ceded back to Spain. In 1821 it was conveyed to the United States by
                        Spain, and in 1845 it was admitted to the Union as the twenty-seventh

                    colonies of Spain, were striving to establish themselves as independent
                    republics, and it was feared that an alliance of Europe nations would help Spain
                    to subdue them. President Monroe, therefore, sent a message to Congress, in
                    which he announced what has always since been known as "The Monroe Doctrine."
                    This doctrine was, that the United States would object to any attempt on the
                    part of European powers to "extend their system" of interference to "any part of
                    this hemisphere." This was a declaration of independence for the whole of
                    America. The United States still maintains the principle as stated by Monroe.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">John Quincy Adams, the sixth President, was the son of John Adams,
                    the second President. He was born in Braintree, Mass., in 1767. He studied in
                    France and Holland, and spent some time in Sweden, Denmark, Russia, and England
                    while yet a boy. He graduated at Harvard College when he was twenty years old,
                    and studied law. He was at various times American minister at the courts of
                    Holland, England, Prussia, and Russia, and was one of commissioners to negotiate
                    the treaty with England at the close of the War of 1812. He was Secretary of
                    State in Monroe's Cabinet, and President of the United States from 1825 to 1829.
                    When he quitted the presidency he did not leave public life, but sat in the
                    lower house of Congress from 1831 to 1848, and this was the most brilliant part
                    of his career. At eighty years of age he was still called "The old man
                    eloquent." He died in the Capitol at Washington in 1848.</p>

                    not bend to the people; his cold manners and his disregard for the opinions of
                    others made him enemies, who succeeded in preventing his re-election.</p>

                            President from 1829 to 1837. As the first President that had risen from
                            the ranks of the common people, he was very popular, and was supposed to
                            represent the American ideas of the time. He was called "Old Hickory" by

                    roads and other "internal improvements" by the general government. Jackson set

                    his time, that a State could "nullify" a law of the United States. The business
                    of the United States with other nations was conducted during Jackson's
                    administration with great spirit and ability, and the country was respected

                    divisions. Jackson loved his friends and hated all opponents. The country came
                    to be divided into Jackson men and anti-Jackson men. The Jackson men claimed to

                    <p TEIform="p">Clay, Calhoun, and Webster are often spoken of together. They
                        were the three great statesmen of what is sometimes known as "the compromise
                        period" of American history. Henry Clay was born in Virginia in 1777. He was
                        a poor boy, and gained his education with difficulty. He settled in Kentucky
                        as a young man, and long represented that State in the House of
                        Representatives and the Senate. John C. Calhoun was born in South Carolina
                        in 1782, and graduated at Yale College. Clay and Calhoun were both bold
                        advocates of the war with England in 1812. Webster, who was born in the same
                        year with Calhoun, entered Congress in 1813, during the war. From this time
                        these three men gradually came to the front as the greatest masters of the
                        art of debate the country had known. Calhoun was a member of Monroe's
                        Cabinet, Clay of John Quincy Adams's, Webster of Harrison's and Fillmore's.
                        But they were all three greatest in Congress. Each of them desired to be
                        President, but all were disappointed. Calhoun was Vice-President for eight
                        years, from 1825 to 1833. Clay was active in bringing about the Missouri
                        Compromise, which Calhoun favored. Later than this Calhoun became the chief
                        advocate of the doctrine that the States were sovereign, and that the Union
                        was a compact of sovereign States. Clay and Webster, on the other hand, were
                        advocates of the authority of the Union. Clay was the author of the
                        Compromise of 1850, which Webster favored. Calhoun died in 1850; Clay and
                        Webster in 1852.</p>

                    South Carolina, was on the Democratic side. He believed in the power of a State
                    to "nullify" a law of the nation. But the Democratic party generally agreed with
                    Jackson, that the laws of the United States were supreme until the courts
                    decided them unconstitutional.</p>

                    began in ways of travel that have made life different from that of our
                    forefathers. We have seen in previous chapters that travel in old times was very
                    slow. Men jogged along day after day and week after week to make a journey of
                    hundreds of miles on horseback, or they were jolted over bad roads in
                    stage-wagons or carriages. Pack-horses or heavy wagons carried all the freight
                    that went by land. Boats, rowed or pushed with poles, went slowly up and down
                    the rivers, carrying passengers and freight. Periaugers, with oars and sails,
                    and other small vessels, plied up and down the coast, and all the ships at sea
                    were propelled by sails.</p>

                    launched in 1807, and ran between New York and Albany, to the great wonder of
                    all who saw her. Steamboats soon after took the place of keel-boats (page 233)
                    on the Western rivers, and they greatly aided in the rapid development of the

                    long used in Europe, were thought of for this purpose, and Washington was much
                    interested in a proposed canal from the Potomac to the Ohio River. But the first

                    its completion was celebrated by a procession of boats from Albany to the ocean,
                    where Governor De Witt Clinton poured a keg of Lake Erie water into the sea, as
                    a sign of their union. This canal, by opening a trade with the West, made New
                    York the greatest city of the United States.</p>

                    the railway, which was introduced from England. The first railroads were merely
                    tracks of iron bars, on which little cars, loaded with coal, were drawn from the
                    mines. The first railway in the United States was but two miles long, and was
                    used only for hauling stone. The cars were drawn by horses. The first
                    passenger-train in America was run on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1830,
                    but the cars were drawn by horses the first year. The extension of railways was
                    very rapid; they changed America more than any other country, because here the
                    distances are so great. We have almost as many miles of railway as all the world
                    besides.</p>

                    cars for passengers were early introduced, and the parlor-car, the sleeping-car,
                    the hotel-car, and the dining-car are all of American origin, and are little
                    used elsewhere. The street tramway, or horse-railroad, and the elevated railways
                    for rapid travel in cities, were first used in this country.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The electric telegraph, in its present practical shape, was the
                    invention of an American artist, S. F. B. Morse. In old times people sent
                    messaged by objects shown on high ground, by lights displayed at night, or by
                    bonfires kindled on the hills. Even the wild Indians sent intelligence across
                    the plains by waving a blanket over a fire and thus making a "smoke-signal." In
                    1835 Morse set up and worked a telegraphic wire. But it was nine years later
                    before he could persuade Congress to appropriate money to set up the first line.
                    In 1844 the first message was sent from Washington to Baltimore.</p>

                        the session of Congress. There were a large number of bills in advance of
                        the one for promoting the telegraph. But the next morning the daughter of
                        Commissioner Ellsworth called at his lodgings and informed him that a bill
                        had passed granting $30,000 to build an experimental telegraph line. When
                        the line was built from Washington to Baltimore, this young lady was allowed
                        to dictate the first dispatch, which she did, sending the words, "What hath
                        God wrought!" The first public news dispatch brought to Washington the
                        intelligence that James K. Polk had been nominated for President.</p>

                    a bill for the annexation of Texas, which was accomplished just before Tyler

                    Mexico. A large number of Americans had settled on grants of land there. These
                    came into collision with the Mexican government, which was arbitrary and
                    oppressive, and an armed revolution broke out in Texas in 1835. The Texans were
                    commanded by General Sam Houston, and after several defeats achieved their
                    independence. For about ten years Texas was an independent country, and was
                    treated as such by several European nations as well as by the United States. It
                    was annexed to the United States by treaty, and admitted to the Union in 1845.
                    In territory it is about the size of France.</p>

                    would have remained a dispute about its true boundary. Our government supported
                    the claim of Texas, that the Rio Grande [ree'-o grand'-deh] was the true border,
                    while Mexico would not allow that the State of Texas extended farther to the
                    west than the Nueces [noo-eth'-ez] River. Grounds of quarrel with Mexico.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When General Taylor occupied this disputed territory, in 1846, the
                    Mexicans attacked his troops, and thus hostilities began. With a force much
                    inferior to the Mexicans, Taylor fought and won the battle of Palo Alto
                    [Pah'-loo ah'-to], and afterward attacked and defeated them in a strong position
                    at Resaca de la Palma [ray-sac'-ah day lah pall'-mah].</p>

                    crossed the river and took possession of the city of Matamoros. But the Mexicans
                    showed no disposition to make peace. Having received re-enforcements, Taylor

                    to command in a new campaign, which was to be made into Mexico by way of Vera
                    Cruz [vayrah crooth']. Thus weakened, General Taylor took up a strong position
                    at Buena Vista [bway'-nah vees'-tah], where he was attacked by twenty thousand
                    Mexicans under Santa Anna. After two days of the most courageous fighting, and
                    after running the greatest risk of an overwhelming defeat, the little American
                    army achieved the most brilliant victory of the war.</p>

                    bravely, but the frequent revolutions and pretty civil wars in Mexico had
                    demoralized officers and soldiers. The arms of the Mexicans were also out of
                    date. The Americans of that time were brave and enterprising, and a little too
                    fond of military glory. They fought with great boldness and steadiness, and
                    their early victories made them expect success.</p>

                    party. Under his lead the few American settlers there established an independent

                    thus annexed to the United States. It now became the main object with the United

                    thought that the Mexicans would readily make peace when their capital was

                        belonged to Mexico was Alta California, or, in English, Upper California;
                        Lower California still remains a part of Mexico. Upper California was first
                        visited by the Spaniards in 1542. Sir Francis Drake, the same who took
                        Ralegh's colony back to England in 1585, visited Upper California in 1579,
                        calling it New Albion, which means New England. It was nearly two hundred
                        years later, in 1769, when Catholic missionaries from spain made the first
                        settlement of white people in that country. There were only about then
                        thousand white inhabitants in the whole province when it was seized by the
                        United States in 1846. In the summer of that year California settlers from
                        the United States set up a movement for independence, and tried to establish
                        a government, known now as "The Bear Flag Republic." They were aided by
                        captain Fremont (afterward a general), who was in the province as the leader
                        of an exploring expedition. United States naval officers on the coast,
                        expecting a war between the United States and Mexico, raised the American
                        flag on shore, and after some fighting, the province remained in American
                        hands, and was definitely annexed at the close of the Mexican War. In 1848
                        gold was discovered in California, and the next year many thousands of
                        people from the Eastern States sailed around Cape Horn to seek their
                        fortunes in the richest gold-mines in the world. In 1849 the people formed a
                        State government, and the State was admitted to the Union in 1850. at first
                        its chief interest was gold-mining, but now it is a State of very great
                        agricultural resources, especially in fruit-growing.</p>

                    beginning of the war to the conquest of the capital, their national pride made
                    them very loath to make peace. In February, 1848, nearly five months after the
                    capture of the capital, a peace was signed, by which all the territory of New
                    Mexico, as then constituted, and Upper California became United States
                    territory. Our government, however, agreed to pay fifteen million dollars to
                    Mexico, and to pay the claims of our own citizens against Mexico.</p>

                    of brave men who fell in fighting on a foreign soil, or perished by the heat of
                    the climate and the diseases of the country, and it caused much misery to
                    innocent people in Mexico. No doubt, the ignorance and prejudice prevailing in
                    Mexico at that time, and the frequent overthrow of one government and the
                    setting up of another, made it difficult to treat with that country without war.</p>

                    chapter in our history. It brought on the Mexican War. That brought a large
                    addition to our territory. It was necessary to settle the question of slavery in
                    the annexed territory, and this opened the slavery question anew. Both of the
                    old parties were after a while split asunder by the debate, and the question of
                    slavery or no slavery in the Territories became the leading issue in our
                    politics. In sixteen years from the annexation of Texas, this chain of causes
                    had plunged the country into the most tremendous civil war in the history of the
                    world. In just twenty years the war had ended in the entire abolition of slavery
                    in the United States. Thus, the annexation of Texas brought about unforeseen
                    results, and changed the history of the continent.</p>

                    reopened. The antislavery men who persisted in agitating the question were
                    thought unpatriotic. They were severely persecuted even by Northern people, who
                    feared that their agitation of the subject might destroy the Union of the
                    States.</p>

                    between the free and slave States began anew. In 1846, during the Mexican War, a
                    bill was introduced in Congress <pb id="VAA2336-307" n="293" TEIform="pb"/>
                    looking to a peace with Mexico, to be made by a purchase of territory. Mr.
                    Wilmot, of Pennsylvania, moved to add a proviso that slavery should never exist
                    in the territory thus acquired. This was known as "the Wilmot Proviso." The
                    proviso was finally rejected, but it opened the question of freedom or slavery
                    in the new territory before the Mexican War was ended.</p>

                    party, which desired to shut slavery out of the Territories. The Democrats
                    nominated General Cass; the Whigs nominated General Zachary Taylor, the hero of
                    Buena Vista, for President. The Free-Soilers nominated ex-President Martin Van
                    Buren. Taylor was elected. After serving for a year and four months, President
                    Taylor died, and was succeeded by Millard Fillmore, the Vice-President.</p>

                    Cape Horn, and trains of ox-carts went across the plains, then occupied only by
                    Indians. In 1849 the people of California set up a State government without
                    authority from Congress, and asked to be immediately admitted to the Union. As
                    part of the new State was south of the Missouri Compromise line, and as its
                    Constitution forbade slavery, the slave States were opposed to this addition to

                    States officers. California was admitted as a free State, and New Mexico
                    organized as a Territory without slavery. The leading statesmen of the country

                    Democratic party felt obliged to take new ground. A party was founded in 1853,
                    which proposed to keep foreigners out of office and to make them wait a longer
                    term before becoming citizens. This new party was the "American party." Its
                    members were organized in secret lodges, and it carried many elections by
                    surprise. To all questions about its doings the members of this order answered,
                    "I don't know." From this arose the name "Know-Nothing," which was commonly
                    applied to the party. It spread rapidly for two or three years, but died as
                    quickly as it had come into life, for the slavery question took a new form,
                    which left no room for nay other debate.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">This new form was brought about by the bill organizing the
                    Territories of Nebraska and Kansas, introduced in 1854 by Senator Douglas, of
                    Illinois. This bill repealed the Missouri Compromise, which had been adopted <pb
                        id="VAA2336-313" n="299" TEIform="pb"/> in 1820. By that compromise slavery
                    had been forbidden in all new territory north of latitude thirty-six degrees and
                    a half. Kansas and Nebraska were on the north side of this line. The "Nebraska
                    Bill," as it was called, repealed this restriction, and left it for the settlers
                    in the new territory to decide the question of slavery for themselves. This was
                    called "Squatter Sovereignty" in the discussions of the time.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">The excitement over the repeal of the Missouri Compromise exceeded
                    any ever before known in this country. Many people in the North regarded it as
                    an act of bad faith. People in the South claimed that they had an equal right
                    with free-state people to take their property of every kind to the new
                    Territories. Both sides became exceedingly violent. As President Pierce favored
                    the Nebraska Bill, those Whigs who took the same side generally went over to the
                    Democratic party, while those opposed to the repeal of the Missouri Compromise,
                    whether Whigs or Democrats, united, and, with the old Free-Soil party, formed an
                    "Anti-Nebraska party." This presently took the name "Republican," but it is not
                    to be confounded with the old Republican party of the days of Jefferson.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Meantime the great struggle between the two sections had been
                    transferred to the new Territory of Kansas. This lay directly west of Missouri,
                    and a strong effort was made to secure it, both by the North and the South.
                    Emigrants poured in from both sides of the line between the free and the slave
                    Sates. Societies were formed a the North to promote emigration, and in Missouri
                    to keep emigrants from the free States away. Many free-state men were stopped
                        <pb id="VAA2336-314" n="300" TEIform="pb"/> and turned back on the Missouri
                    River. The free-state people and the slave-state people now came into collision
                    on the Kansas prairies. Men from Missouri assisted the Southern party. Rival
                    government were formed. Kansas soon became the scene of a violent struggle.
                    Midnight assassinations and mobs were common, and something like open war broke
                    out from time to time. The men from the Northern States soon had a majority, and
                    asked admission to the Union. The bloody feud in Kansas by this time produced
                    the greatest excitement in Congress and convulsed the whole country.</p>

                    John C. Fremont, who had become known as a daring explorer in the Western

                    Democratic candidate, was elected. Fillmore got but eight electoral votes,
                    Fremont one hundred and fourteen, and Buchanan one hundred and seventy-four. The
                    election showed that the people were interested in nothing but the settlement of
                    the slavery question. No presidential elec <pb id="VAA2336-315" n="301"

                <p TEIform="p">The Supreme Court of the United States now attempted to settle the
                    question of slavery in the Territories, and thus take it out of politics. In the
                    spring of 1857, in the case of a negro named Dred Scott, who sued for his
                    freedom on the ground that his master had taken him to a free State, the Supreme
                    Court decided that the African whose ancestors had been slaves had no rights
                    under the Constitution, and that Congress had no power to forbid slavery in the
                    Territories. So, far from settling the question, this decision proved to be oil
                    on the fire. The North now feared that slavery would be made national by a
                    decision of the Supreme Court.</p>

                    liberate the slaves. As he had but eighteen men under his command, he was soon
                    overcome. He was tried and executed, but this raid alarmed the South more than
                    the Dred Scott decision had the North. People at the South began to fear that
                    the Northern people were trying to arm the slaves for the murder of their
                    masters.</p>

                    the Democratic party. The majority in the convention of the party nominated

                </note>
                <p TEIform="p">From the beginning of the government there were two opinions in
                    regard to the power of a State under the Constitution. The Federalists thought
                    that nearly all the powers of government were vested in the United States
                    authorities, but the Jefferson Republicans held that a State retained a
                    considerable share of independence. At a later period the chief advocate for the
                    sovereignty of the State had been John C. Calhoun, of South Carolina (page 268),
                    who though a State could declare an act of Congress nullthat is, not valid
                    within its bounds. In 1832 the State of South Carolina declared the tariff law
                    null, and forbade its citizens to pay the duties. This was called nullification;
                    but President Jackson, who did not believe in the doctrine, threatened the
                    nullifiers with the army and navy of the United States.</p>

                    exercising the right of the individual State, they might lawfully secede from
                    the Union. South Carolina first passed an ordinance of secession on December 20,
                    1860. By the 1st of February each of the seven "cotton States" had declared

                </note>
                <p TEIform="p">Meantime the recollection of the success of the Missouri Compromise
                    in 1820 (page 260), and of the Compromise of 1850-(page 294), led some members
                    of Congress to try to settle the troubles once more by compromise. Many plans
                    for changes in the Constitution and laws were proposed in Congress, but all
                    without avail. A "Peace Convention," suggested by Virginia, assembled in
                    Washington on the 4th of February, 1861. There were delegates from all but the
                    seceded States. John Tyler, ex-President of the United States, was president of
                    this convention. But the plan of compromise suggested by the Peace Convention
                    failed, like all others. The time for compromises had gone by, and it was beyond
                    the ingenuity of man to prevent a collision between the two sections which had
                    opposed each other in politics, and were now about to try their strength and
                    endurance in the deadly struggles of the battle-field.</p>

                    they belonged; the other Secretaries wished him to use force in putting down the
                    rebellion against his authority. The President, for his part, did not believe
                    that the States had a right to go out of the Union, but he also did not believe
                    that he had any authority to compel them to stay in. So everything was in
                    confusion, debate, and perplexity in that awful winter, during which a storm was

                    batteries, after a while, replied. For thirty-six hours the bombardment
                    continued, setting fire to the wood-work of the fort and pounding its walls to
                    pieces. At the end of this time Major Anderson, whose provisions were nearly
                    exhausted, agreed to evacuate the fort.</p>

                    bombardment. But the bombardment of Sumter changed the whole situation. Doubt
                    was at an end on both sides. Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas,
                    forced now to take one side or the other, soon joined the Confederacy. On the
                    other hand, the Sunday morning on which Major Anderson marched out of fort
                    Sumter saw the Northern States also almost of one mind. Men were wild with
                    excitement, and political parties were forgotten. It was not for congress or the
                    President to decide on peace or warthe war burst uncontrollably from the pent-up
                    feelings of the people.</p>

                    secession. "Our States are sovereign, and have a right to secede when they think
                    they have reason," was the Southern view of the matter. "You are a part of the
                    Union, which forms but one nation, and to break up the Union is rebellion," was
                    the Northern view. But the passions excited by the bitter debate over questions
                    relating to slavery lay at the bottom of the struggle. Neither side dreamed of
                    the long and bloody conflict that was to follow. Each expected to settle the
                    matter in two or three battles. But of them found out what stubborn work it was

                    superior degree to the North. The North had also the advantage of numbers; the

                    Sidney Johnston, rapidly collected a strong army, and determined to crush the
                    force at the Landing before Grant could be re-enforced by the arrival of another

                    drive Grant's army back between the river and a creek. The loss on that dreadful
                    Sunday was great on both sides. The Confederates, with desperate energy, drove
                    Grant's men back until Pittsburg Landing was almost in their possession. But
                    their general, Albert Sidney Johnston, was killed. Buell's army began to arrive,
                    and the Union troops were re-formed in the night. The second day's fighting was
                    also extremely severe. The exhausted Confederates under Beauregard at length
                    retired from the field. This was the first great battle of the war.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Instead of moving directly against the Confederate forces lying in
                    front of him, McClellan thought best to take his army by water to Fortress
                    Monroe, and from there to go up between York River and James River toward
                    Richmond. The land between these two rivers forms a peninsula; this is therefore
                    known as the Peninsular campaign. From the beginning, the campaign was
                    unfortunate in many ways. Part of the troops which McClellan expected to receive
                    were detained for the defense of Washington. The Confederates forced him to
                    spend a month in the siege of Yorktown. Yorktown was evacuated on the 5th of
                    May. McClellan's troops pursued the retiring Confederates, and fought the battle
                    of Williamsburg that day. The Confederates retreated at night toward Richmond.</p>

                    which he defeated or confused several bodies of Union troops and frightened the
                    authorities at Washington, so that McDowell's troops at Fredericksburg were held

                    parts by the Chickahominy River, and won a partial success. Johnston having been
                    wounded in this battle, General Robert E. Lee succeeded him. Stonewall Jackson
                    now slipped away from the Valley of Virginia, and suddenly brought his army down
                    by rail to assist Lee in the struggle against McClellan.</p>

                    A new general must be found. Pope, whose energy and success at Island No. 10 had
                    given him reputation, was put in command of the army in front of Washington, and
                    the army on the James River was brought back by degrees to reinforce him.</p>

                        Mexican War he was twice brevetted for meritorious conduct. He resigned from
                        the army in 1852, and became a professor in the Virginia Military Institute.
                        He entered the Confederate service at the beginning of the war. During the
                        first battle of Bull Run he resisted a charge with so much steadfastness
                        that he gained the title of "Stonewall Jackson," by which name he will be
                        known in history. The promptness and rapidity of his marches, and the
                        obstinate courage he showed on the battle-field, made him and important
                        factor in the war. He was shot by mistake by his own men, May 2, 1863, and

                    old Bull Run battle-field (August 29 and 30, 1862), and Pope showed his usual
                    energy, but his enemy had beaten him in skillful manuvres, and his army fell

                    the 18th Lee withdrew across the Potomac, and McClellan followed slowly, and

                    army opposed to Lee, and General George G. Meade succeeded him. Near Gettysburg,
                    in Pennsylvania, the vanguards of the two great armies met on the 1st day of
                    July, 1863. The people of the North and those of the South were filled with fear
                    and anxiety as this battle approached. The courage of the troops on both sides
                    was simply marvelous. On the second day of the battle the Confederates carried
                    works at both ends of the Union line. The next day the Union army recovered the
                    lost ground on its right. The Confederates then made a tremendous assault an
                    broke through the center of the Federal army, but they were soon driven back
                    defeated. Lee's army rested a day and then retreated. Lee had lost about one
                    third of his men: Meade had lost a good deal more than a fourth of his. In all,
                    about forty-eight thousand had been killed, wounded, or captured in this awful

                    chapter. Many things of the highest importance were happening else-where, while
                    McClellan and the generals who came after him were wrestling with Johnston, Lee,
                    and Jackson for Washington and Richmond.</p>

                </note>
                <p TEIform="p">At the very moment that McClellan was getting ready to move his army
                    to the Peninsula, there took place a famous naval battle in the waters of
                    Hampton Roads, near Fortress Monroe. The Confederates, having seized the Norfolk
                    Navy-Yard, had changed the hull of the steam-frigate Merrimac into an
                    iron-plated steam-ram, and named it the "Virginia." On the 8th of March, the
                    Virginia, or, as she is generally spoken of, the Merrimac, came out from Norfolk
                    into Hampton Roads, and after a battle sank the sloop-of-war Cumberland. The
                    frigate Congress was next disabled and afterward burned, for nothing built of
                    wood could make any impression on this iron monster, whose sloping sides
                    resisted cannon-balls as a bird's feathers shed the rain. The loss of life on
                    both the vessels that were destroyed was great. The steam-frigate Minnesota,
                    which was aground, was only saved from destruction by the coming of night. It
                    was expected that, with the morning, the iron ship would complete the sinking of
                    the shipping in Hampton Roads, <pb id="VAA2336-340" n="325" TEIform="pb"/> and
                    then go to the Potomac and attack Washington city. But, at midnight, there
                    arrived from New York, all unexpected, a little iron vessel, named the Monitor,
                    of a new pattern, invented by John Ericsson. The next morning, when the Merrimac
                    came out again, the Monitor successfully defended the Minnesota, until the
                    Confederate ram, having met its match, retire. This battle in Hampton Roads
                    changed the construction of war-ships the world over, for it was proved that
                    wooden ships were of no use against iron ones.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">At the beginning, many of the Northern people, who were very much in
                    favor of the war to preserve the Union, had been opposed to the abolition of
                    slavery. But, as the struggle went on, the feeling at the North against slavery
                    increased. On the 22d of September, 1862, just after the battle of Antietam,
                    President Lincoln announced that, if any portion of the country should remain in
                    arms against the government, he would declare <note type="margin"

                    country free. On the 1st of January, 1863, a proclamation was made, declaring
                    the slaves free in all parts of the country then in armed rebellion against the
                    government.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">We have seen that the first object of the Union armies in the West
                    was to wrest the Mississippi River from the Confederate forces who held it by
                    powerful works at Vicksburg and by forts below New Orleans. While the armies
                    were operating above, the river was attacked from below. On the 18th of April,
                    1862, the bombardment of the forts below New Orleans was begun by a fleet of

                    o'clock on the morning of the 24th, Farragut, in command of the fleet, took the
                    bold course of running his ships past the forts. The Confederates resisted by a
                    tremendous fire from the forts and from their ships. They also tried to burn the
                    United States vessels by floating down upon them fire-rafts and burning
                    steamboats loaded with cotton, and they attacked them also with an iron-clad
                    ram, named the Manassas. But, not withstanding this resolute defense, Farragut
                    got by the forts, with some loss, and captured the city. The forts afterward
                    surrendered.</p>

                    manoeuvring in Kentucky, the Confedrates, under General Van Dorn, attacked this

                    drove the Union army from line to line until a part of the attacking force
                    actually gained the town. But the resistance of the troops under Rosecrans was
                    as stubborn as the attack was resolute, and Van Dorn's assaults were repulsed:</p>

                    generalship. They were especially strong in this regard in the Virginia
                    campaigns. But the Union armies at the West were gradually coming under the
                    control of General Grant, a man of restless vigor and tremendous power of
                    endurance under difficulty and repulse. All his first attempts to take Vicksburg
                    failed. Plan after plan was tried. A ditch was dug across the bend of the river
                    opposite Vicksburg, in the hope that the river would change its bed, but this
                    failed. Grant tried to open other channels to reach the water-courses in the
                    rear of the city. From time to time, when one plan failed, he resorted to a new

                    series of movements and successive battles he at last shut up the Confederate
                    general Pemberton, with twenty thousand man, in the fortifications of Vicksburg.
                    Grant twice tried to carry the fortifications by assault, but the Confederate
                    soldiers were well-seasoned veterans behind strong works, and the assaults were
                    costly failures. The Union army, therefore, settled down to a regular siege of
                    the place. On the 4th of July, 1863, the day after the battle of Gettysburg in
                    Pennsylvania, the half-starved garrison of Vicksburg surrendered to General
                    Grant.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">The first great battle on this line was that of Stone's River, or
                    Murfreesboro, fought on the last day of the year 1862, about the time that Grant
                    was beginning operations against Vicksburg. The conflict was marked by the
                    brilliant charges made by the Confederates under Bragg, which at length broke to
                    pieces the whole right wing of the Union army. General Rosecrans had succeeded
                    Buell in command of the Union troops. The result of the day's fighting was very
                    favorable to the Confederates. But in the latter part of the day the
                    half-defeated Union soldiers, under the immediate command of General Thomas,
                    made the most determined resistance to the dashes which the Confederates
                    continued to make. Some of the generals wished to retreat, but Rosecrans, who
                    had defended Corinth with so much stubbornness, announced his intention to
                    "fight or die here." On the nest day, which was the first day of 1863, neither
                    of the shattered armies was in a condition to make a serious attack. On the
                    third day of the battle the Confederates, by a tremendous charge, drove back
                    part of the left wing of Rosecrans's army, but they were soon cut to pieces and
                    themselves driven back. After the two armies had bravely held their ground with
                    varying fortunes for three days, Bragg retreated, and Rosecrans entered
                    Murfreesboro. Each army had lost about nine thousand in killed and wounded,
                    besides those captured.</p>

                    re-enforcements, and the great battle Chickamauga was fought on the 19th and
                    20th of September, 1863. It was a battle of charge and counter-charge. On the
                    first day the Union army won considerable advantage; but on the second day the
                    right half of Rosecrans's army was broken, and it retreated in confusion toward
                    Chattanooga. The utter rout of the Union army was prevented by General Thomas,
                    whose division had also saved the army at Murfreesboro. With extraordinary
                    coolness he held the left wing against repeated assaults, and, when ammunition
                    failed, his men used their bayonets to repel the Confederate charges. Though
                    Bragg's troops, by splendid fighting, had gained a great victory, Thomas, by the
                    most brilliant defense of the war, kept them back ling enough to enable
                    Rosecrans to prepare for the defense of Chattanooga, to which place the Union
                    troops retreated.</p>

                    Tennessee, Grant took advantage of this weakening of his force to attack Bragg's
                    army in his front. The main body of Bragg's army was intrenched in Chattanooga
                    Valley. Bragg also held Missionary Ridge, in his rear, and Lookout Mountain, to
                    the south-west. Hooker attacked and carried Lookout Mountain on the morning of

                    is sometimes called "The Battle above the Clouds." But Sherman, who had
                    previously carried an outlying hill at the north end of Missionary Ridge, was
                    checked in his attempt to advance by the obstinate resistance of the
                    Confederates under Hardee. Grant, therefore, sent the army under Thomas out of
                    Chattanooga to attack the Confederates in front, with instructions to carry the
                    first line and lie down. By a swift charge, under a severe fire, they carried
                    the line at the foot of the mountain; but the guns of the Confederates on the
                    top of Missionary Ridge sent a galling fire upon them. without orders one
                    impatient regiment after another rushed up the hill. Bragg's troops made a
                    vigorous resistance, but the eager assailants carried the line in six places,
                    and the Confederate army was forced to retreat.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Grant was now put in command of all the Union armies, and he took
                    charge in person of the army in front of Washington, while Sherman was left to
                    command the Western army. Sherman, a man of incessant activity and ability of
                    many kinds, was confronted by the Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston, who
                    had been appointed to succeed Bragg. Johnston also was a man of military genius,
                    and extremely prudent. Sherman, by skillful manceuvres, tried to force Johnston
                    to fight in the open field, so as to increase the difficulty of supplying his
                    army, and to compel Sherman to attack him behind breastworks.</p>

                    length, Sherman got a considerable part of his army south of Atlanta, so that

                    the battle of Chattanooga, was put in command of all the armies of the Union. He
                    left Sherman, as we have seen, to command in the West, while he took up his
                    headquarters with Meade in front Washington. The veteran Eastern armies that had
                    fought so long against each other, between Washington and Richmond, were now to
                    fight to the death, each under the most famous general on its side.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">Ulysses S. Grant was born in Point Pleasant, Ohio, April 27,
                        1822. He spent his bodyhood on a farm. In 1839 he was appointed a cadet at
                        West Point, from which he graduated about the middle of his class in rank.
                        As a lieutenant in the Mexican War, he was conspicuous for bravery, taking
                        part in the battles of palo Alto, Resaca de la Palma, and the assault on
                        Monterey. He also took part in the siege of Vera Cruz, and the succeeding
                        battle of Scott's campaign. He resigned from the army in 1854 and engaged in
                        farming, but was not successful. When the civil was broke out he was a clerk
                        in the leather-store of his father in Galena, Ill., on a small salary. He
                        then became mustering officer for the State of Illinois, was appointed
                        colonel of the Twenty-first Regiment from that State, and thus entered on
                        his great military career, the outlines of which will be found in the text.
                        After serving two terms as President, he retired to private life, and made a
                        journey round the world, receiving honours wherever he went. He died on
                        Mount McGregor, N. Y., on the 23d of July, 1885.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Under Grant and Meade, the Army of the Potomac moved forward to ward
                    Richmond. It encountered Lee's <pb id="VAA2336-353" n="338" TEIform="pb"/> army
                    in a region of dense wood, full of undergrowth known as "The Wilderness."
                    Grant's army was much the more numerous, for by this time the South, which had
                    put forth nearly its whole strength from the beginning, was becoming somewhat
                    exhausted. On the otherhand, Lee fought behind intrenchments, and, in changing
                    his position moved on shorter lines than his opponet. For sixteen days, in the
                    Wilderness and about Spottsylvania Court-House, the armies were so close to each
                    other in the thick brush that the men had to be continually on guard, and so
                    they got little chance for sleep. When they changed positions, the marching was
                    generally done in the night, while the days witnessed the most tremendous
                    fighting the had been seen since the battle of the great Napoleon. In sixteen
                    days the Union army lost 37,500 men, and Lee's losses, though much less, were
                    severe.</p>

                </note>
                <p TEIform="p">Robert Edward Lee was born in Virginia, June 19, 1807. He graduated
                    at West point in 1829, second in his class. He distinguished himself as an
                    engineer in the siege of Vera Cruz. He was for three years in command of the
                    Military Academy at West Point. When his own State of Virginia seceded, he
                    thought himself bound to go with it. He resigned his commission on the 20th of
                    April, 1861, and was made commander-in chief of the Virginia State forces, and
                    later a Confederate general. To his great ability was mostly due the
                    stubbornness of the struggle carried on by the Confederates between Richmond and
                    Washington. After the war was over, General Lee accepted the result manfully,
                    and devoted himself to his duties as President of Washington-lee University, at
                    Lexington, Va., where he died on the 12th of October, 1870.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Lee was not crushed, but Grant got nearer to Richmond from time to
                    time by secretly moving a part of the army from his right and marching it around
                    to the rear of his other troops, and then pushing it as far ahead on his left as
                    possible. By thus outflanking Lee, Grant compelled him to fall back, that he
                    might not be cut off from Richmond and his supplies. But Lee always managed to
                    fall back in time to be <pb id="VAA2336-354" n="339" TEIform="pb"/> again
                    between Grant's army and Richmond. The two great generals and the two veteran
                    armies were well matched and neither could gain a complete victory.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">This fighting and this moving to the eastward and around Lee's flank
                    were kept up with varying success until Grant got near to Richmond, when, on the
                    2d of June, 1864, at Cold Harbor, Grant attacked the Confederate works along the
                    whole line. The Union army was repulsed with a loss of nearly six thousand men
                    in an hour.</p>

                    General Grant's army began to cross the James River. As soon as over, they made
                    an attempt to capture Petersburg, in order to cut off one source of supplies and
                    re-enforcements for Richmond. The outer works near Petersburg were carried, but
                    the Confederates fell back to new lines, and received re-enforcements. The
                    attempt to drive them out of these by assault failed. The Union troops now built
                    trenches close up to the Confederate works, and the two armies held these
                    frowning lines, face to face, for nine months, until within a few days of the
                    close of the war.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">In all the years of the war there had been a smaller campaign carried
                    on in the Valley of Virginia. This fertile valley lies between ranges of
                    mountains. Its morthern end reaches the Potomac not very far away from
                    Washington. In this valley the Confederate general Breckinridge defeated General
                    Sigel at New Market on the 15th of May, 1864. General Hunter, who took command
                    of the Union troops, defeated the Confederate general Imboden at Piedmont twenty
                    days later. Hunter, with eighteen thousand men, pushed for Lynchburg, which was
                    a place of the greatest importance. He destroyed railroads and worked much
                    damage, but Lynchburg was re-enforced in time to save it. Finding his retreat
                    down the Valley cut off, Hunter saved his starving army by making his way into
                    the Kanawha Valley. This took him to the west of the Alleghany Mountains, and
                    quite out of the Valley.</p>

                    straight for Washington, which he might have captured at a dash had he been a
                    little quicker; but re-enforcements from Grant's army marched into the works as
                    the assault began, and he was repulsed. He retreated again up the Valley,
                    pursued by a strong force. But, when a part of the Union troops was withdrawn
                    and sent back to Grant, Early attacked and defeated those under Crook at

                    Pertersburg, Sheridan attacked him and won the battle of Opequon, or Winchester,
                    on the 19th of September, 1864. Three days later, Sheridan attacked Early in his
                    trenches at Fisher's Hill, having sent a force around to suddenly assail him on
                    one side or flank, while the rest of the Union troops charged the works in
                    front. Early's men, attacked on two sides, were routed and driven farther up the
                    Valley to the south.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Philip Henry Sheridan was born in Albany, N. Y., March 6, 1831. He
                    graduated at West Point in 1853. He first gained distinction as a cavalry
                    commander, then he showed great qualities at Perryville and Murfreesboro, after
                    which he was made a major-general. At Chickamauga and in the battles about
                    Chattanooga he further distinguished himself. His campaign in the Valley of
                    Virginia and the part he play in the closing scenes made him one of the most
                    famous generals of the war. He succeeded Sherman at the head of the army, and in
                    1888 he was made a full general. Only Grant and Sherman had attained that rank
                    in the United States army before him. He died at Nonquitt, Mass., Aug. 5, 1888.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Sheridan burned all the barns filled with grain, and carried off all
                    the stock in the Valley, to prevent the Confederates from returning. But when
                    Sheridan went back toward the Potomac, Early, largely re-enforced, followed him
                    through this land of starvation. While Sheridan was absent from his troops, a
                        <pb id="VAA2336-357" n="342" TEIform="pb"/> part of Early's array, leaving
                    behind their swords, canteens, and everything that could make a noise, moved the
                    night along a lonely path until they got around the flank and behind the Union
                    army, and surprised them while they were asleep. Early, at the same time, with
                    the rest of his troops, attacked Sheridan's army in front This was the beginning
                    of the battle of Cedar Creek. The Confederates defeat and drove back the Union
                    troops for four miles, capturing many prisoners. Sheridan, hearing the firing,
                    put spurs to his horse, and rode up the Valley, calling to his fleeing soldiers,
                    "Come, boys, we're going back!" His presence turned the tide, and by night had
                    defeated Early once more. A few smaller actions ended the campaign, for most of
                    the troops on both sides were needed at Petersburg, where the last struggle of
                    all was to take place.</p>

                    Sherman captured Atlanta, having in opposition to him the Confederate general
                    Hood. The latter was a bold man, and he determined to force Sherman to fall back
                    into Tennessee again, by going to his rear and cutting off his supplies from the
                    North. But Sherman, knowing that the resources of the South were almost
                    exhausted, concluded to risk a blow that might end the war. Leaving the troops
                    in Tennessee under command of General Thomas, he set out from Atlanta with the
                    rest of his army, to march southward through the heart of the Confederacy.</p>

                    before lie could get his forces together. Hood attacked a part of General
                    Thomas's troops, under General Schofield, at Franklin in Tennessee. The
                    Confederates made the most desperate charges, carrying, at first, a portion of
                    the Union lines, but Schofield succeeded in holding his works long enough to get
                    safely across the Harpeth River. He then fell back, and joined Thomas at
                    Nashville. Hood soon encamped before Nashville, where, after a rather long
                    delay, he was attacked on the morning of December 15th by Thomas's whole army. A
                    two days' battle ensued, which resulted in the utter defeat of Hood's army. This
                    was a blow from which the exhausted Confederacy could not recover.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">While Hood and Thomas were manuvring in Tennessee, Sherman and his
                    army were marching through the Confederacy. His men were consuming supplies that
                    would otherwise have sustained Lee in Richmond. Railroads of the greatest
                    military value were utterly destroyed, by making fires of the cross-ties and
                    then heating and twisting the rails. Nothing could have tended more to being the
                    war to an end than the breaking of the railways, on which food and soldiers must
                    be moved. Just before the battle of Nashville was fought, Sherman reached
                    Savannah and laid siege to it, having been about a month without communication
                    with the North. On the 20th of December the Confederates evacuated Savannah, and
                    Sherman occupied it.</p>

                </note>
                <p TEIform="p">In order to give Sherman, when he should move northward, a new base
                    of supplies from the sea, and in order to stop blockade-running, an expedition
                    was <pb id="VAA2336-362" n="347" TEIform="pb"/> sent to capture Wilmington, in
                    North Carolina. Fort Fisher, which guarded the entrance to this place, was
                    bombarded by a fleet and then carried by assault, on January 15, 1865. By way of
                    Wilmington, General Schofield, with a part of Thomas's army from Tennessee, now
                    pushed up to Goldsboro, in North Carolina, tomeet Sherman when he should reach
                    that place.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">William Tecumseh Sherman was born in Ohio in 1820. He graduated at
                    West Point in 1840. He resigned from the army in 1853, and engaged in the
                    banking business in San Francisco. Later he practiced law in Kansas. When the
                    war broke out, he was superintendent of the military school in Louisiana. He was
                    reappointed to the army in 1861. At the close of the war he was next in rank to
                    General Grant, and he became general of the army when Grant became President.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">On the 1st of February, 1865, Sherman's tough veterans left Savannah
                    and moved northward through the Carolinas, in rain and through overflowing
                    swamps. Columbia was taken and burned. It is said to have been burned by
                    accident, or, at least, against the orders of Sherman. The Union army pushed on
                    northward. Johnston did not give battle till Sherman had reached Averysboro, in
                    North Carolina. Here the Confederates were defeated; but at Bentonville, on the
                    19th of March General Joseph E. Johnston came near to defeating one column of
                    Sherman's army before re-enforcements could reach it.</p>

                    bravely suffered the greatest hardships, were now disheartened. Lee began to

                    large as Lee's, moved Sheridan's part of the army around to the south of the
                    Confederate works, in order, if possible, to prevent Lee's dwindling array from
                    getting away.</p>

                    taking place, some of the Confederate works at Petersburg were carried by
                    assault, and others were taken the next day.</p>

                    now starving army was turned toward Lynchburg. Sheridan's cavalry cut him off
                    from Lynchburg, and on the 9th of April, 1865, Lee surrendered his army to
                    General Grant, at Appomattox Court-House.</p>

                    the foreign relations of the United States. Both in England and France there
                    were statesmen who were jealous of the rapid growth of this country. They were
                    afraid that the United States would become more powerful than their own
                    countries, and they would have been pleased to see it divided. In 1861 this

                    much increased by what is called "The Trent affair." Mason and Slidell were sent
                    as ambassadors from the Confederate StatesMason to England, and Slidell to
                    France. They ran the blockade, getting out of the harbor of Charleston during a
                    dark night, and reached Havana. From Havana they sailed in the Trent, an English
                    steamer. Captain Wilkes, of an American man-of-war, stopped the Trent and took
                    Mason and Slidell from it, carrying them Prisoners to the United States. This
                    act produced great excitement in England, and for a while war seemed imminent
                    between the two countries. But on the demand of Great Britain, the United States
                    surrendered the ambassadors, as improperly captured.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">The United States Navy had been rapidly enlarged after the war began.
                    One of its principal duties was to blockade the Southern ports to keep the
                    Confederates from getting arms and other supplies from foreign countries. Many
                    fast-sailing English ships were engaged in running this blockade. These, by the
                    law of nations, were subject to capture by the Union ships, and many were taken,
                    but the high prices paid for the commodities that were got in, justified the
                    risk. These blockade-runners generally entered the Southern ports at night. But,
                    when the chief Southern ports were captured one after another by the navy and
                    land-forces of the Union, blockade-running was gradually stopped.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">The Confederate government could not get much of a navy afloat from
                    ports so well blockaded, but ships were built in England and secretly sent to
                    sea. These received Confederate commissions, and almost succeeded in <pb

                    famous of these ships, called the "Alabama," was commanded by Captain Raphael
                    Semmes. It was built in England, and it captain Raphael Semmes. It was built in
                    England, and it captured in all sixty-seven merchant and whaling ships. In a
                    fight with the United States man-of-war Kearsarge, the Alabama was sunk in the
                    English Channel, June 19, 1864. After the war the United States set up claims
                    against the British government on account of the damages done to American
                    commerce by the Alabama and other Confederate cruisers built in England. The
                    "Alabama claims," as they were called, after years of discussion, were submitted
                    to a court of arbitration which sat in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1872, and
                    condemned England to pay to the United States $15,500,000.</p>

                </note>
                <p TEIform="p">The expenses of the war can never be fully estimated. The United
                    States government borrowed money on interest, by giving bonds to pay after a
                    certain number of years. A large part of this debt has now been paid. But, as
                    another means of borrowing money, "legal-tender notes" were issued; that is,
                    paper bills, which by law could be used to pay debts and taxes, instead of
                    coins. These legal-tender notes were printed on a peculiar green paper, and got
                    the name of "greenbacks." When a great quantity of them had been issued, and the
                    dangers to the government increased, the value of this paper money decreased,
                    until at one time a dollar of it was really worth but half a dollar. However, as
                    the greenbacks were by law good for the payment of debts, they were used instead
                    of the more valuable silver and gold, which for seventeen years disappeard
                    entirely from general use. Long after the war closed, in 1879, the government
                    began to redeem these legal-tender bills in silver and gold. <pb
                        id="VAA2336-368" n="353" TEIform="pb"/> This was called "the resumption of
                    specie payments." But the fact that gold or silver was to be paid for them had
                    made greenbacks worth as much as coin, and people generally preferred to keep
                    the paper money.</p>

                    became almost valueless when the success of the Confederacy became doubtful. It
                    also issued a great deal of legal-tender money, which took the place of coin,
                    and declined in value until twenty dollars of it would not buy one of gold. When
                    the Confederacy was overthrown, this money became of no Confederacy was
                    overthrown, this money became of no value. The decline in the value of its paper
                    money was one of the greatest difficulties the Confederate government had to
                    contend with in its last years.</p>

                    Virginia, removed all doubt about the result, and Lincoln received all the

                    Lee surrendered, Lincoln's mind was already revolving plans for conciliating
                    those who had been opposed to him, and for restoring the government at the
                    South. But, while the President was sitting with his family in a box at the
                    theatre, John Wilkes Booth, one of a band of conspirators, approached him from

                            country was exceedingly wild and rough. The family lived in a half-faced

                            out-of-doors, in front of the open side. Abraham endured many
                            privations, and struggled hard to get an education. The schools were few
                            and the teachers ignorant, but Lincoln trained his own mind by carefully
                            thinking out every subject that puzzled him, and he spent his spare time
                            in reading. He worked on a farm, went to New Orleans on flat-boat, was
                            clerk in a country store, learned and practiced surveying, and then
                            studied law. He served several terms in the Legislature of Illinois, and
                            was a member of Congress. He became a leading gained a national fame by
                            a series of debated, in which he was engaged with Senator Douglas in

                            the nomination for President, and the rest of his history is that of the
                            country. His death took place on the 15th of April, 1865.</p>

                    the death of Lincoln. There soon grew up a difference between Johnson and the
                    Republican Congress in regard to the measures to be adopted for the
                    reconstruction of government in the Southern States. Congress required, among
                    other things, that every State which had seceded should admit the negroes to
                    vote, before the representatives of the State should be again admitted to
                    Congress. President Johnson did not think <pb id="VAA2336-375" n="360"

                <p TEIform="p">The difference between President Johnson and Congress, on several
                    points in regard to reconstruction, resulted in an effort by congress to limit
                    the power of the President to remove officers. The Republicans were more than
                    two thirds of each House, so that they could make laws in spite of the veto of
                    the President. They passed a law forbidding him to make removals from office
                    except by consent of the Senate. This law Johnson refused to obey. The House of
                    Representatives voted to impeach the President; that is, to bring him to trial
                    in order to have him removed as unfit to be President. Such a charge must be
                    made by the House of Representatives, and the Senate is the court which has to
                    decide the case. As less than two thirds of the Senate voted to remove him,
                    Johnson remained President to the end of his term.</p>

                    President. The Democrats nominated Samuel J. Tilden, of New York. The election
                    was a close one, and the country came near to being thrown into a distressing
                    confusion by the condition of the Southern State governments. In some of these
                    were "returning boards," committees which had the right to revise the election

                    violence. By the votes cast, Louisiana had given a majority for Tilden. But the

                    Congress, which had finally to decide the matter. As the Republicans had a
                    majority in the Senate and the Democrats a majority in the House, the two bodies
                    could not agree. The question was at length referred to fifteen commissioners,
                    eight of whom voted to give the election to Hayes.</p>

                    division commander in the Army of the Potomac, was nominated for President by
                    the Democrats. General James A. Garfield, of Ohio, whose distinction was due to
                    the ability he had shown in debate on the floor of Congress, was nominated by
                    the Republicans and elected. Three months after President Garfield was
                    inaugurated, on the 2d of July, 1881, he was shot and mortally wounded by a
                    disappointed office-seeker. Garfield lived eighty days after he was shot, and
                    died on September 19, 1881. His assassin was tried for murder and hanged.</p>

                    and Senator from Maine. The Democrats nominated Grover Cleveland, then popular
                    as Governor of New York. After an unusually severe struggle and a very close
                    election, Cleveland was chosen. The Democratic party thus returned to power for

                    maintained that American manufactures should be protected by levying high duties
                    on articles made abroad, in order that the American market may be kept chiefly
                    for the products of American labor. The other class maintains that high
                    protective duties are unjust to the American consumer, <note type="margin"

                    between the Whigs and Democrats before the civil war. The question of revising

                    uppermost political question in Cleveland's administration? What opinions on
                    this subject have been held by statesmen in favor of a high protective tariff?
                    What do those opposed to such a tariff maintain? What old parties were once
                    divided on this subject?</p>

                    on the south, received before the civil war five great additions to its
                    territory: 1. The old French province of Louisiana, a vast region west of the
                    Mississippi. 2. Oregon (including Washington Territory), by exploration and
                    discovery. 3. Florida, by purchase from Spain. 4. Texas, by the annexation of an
                    independent republic, once a part of Mexico. 5. The Mexican cessions after the

                    territory we have that does not lie adjoining to the rest of the country. It is
                    partly in the arctic regions, but the climate of Alaska on the Pacific coast is
                    not severe. The killing of seals for their furs is the chief business interest
                    in Alaska.</p>

                    thirty-four. By 1876, the hundredth year of the American Republic the number had
                    increased to thirty-eight. Two States had been admitted during the war. The
                    people of the western part of Virginia were mostly on the side of the Union.
                    This part of the State separated itself from eastern Virginia, which was acting
                    with an Confederacy. It obtained admission to the Union in 1863, as a separate
                    State, under the name of West Virginia. Nevada, just east of California, and a

                    farming States. In the centennial year, Colorado came into the Union. This State
                    lies in the Rocky Mountain region, and has gold and silver mines. Cattle-raising
                    is one of its chief industries.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">There remain, when this book is printed, two or three Territories
                    with population enough to entitle them to become States. Dakota is a rich wheat
                    country, and is waiting to be admitted as a whole or as two States. Washington
                    Territory promises soon to be a State, and, when it shall have been admitted,
                    all the Territories on the Pacific coast will have become States. Utah has also
                    population enough for a State. It was settled by people professing the Mormon
                    religion. This religion allows the practice of polygamy, and some of the Mormons
                    have more than one wife apiece. For this reason, Congress has hitherto been
                    unwilling to admit Utah to the Union. The rest of the Territories are in
                    mountain-regions, and their increase in population is rather slow, It is
                    probable, however, that soon after the close of the present century we hall have
                    about fifty States in the Union.</p>

                    white people into conflict with the fierce and warlike Indians of the plains. In
                    the summer of 1862 the eastern bands of the Sioux [soo] nation fell suddenly
                    upon the defenseless settlements of Minnesota, and killed nearly five hundred
                    people. In the war which followed, the Sioux were driven out of the State, and
                    thirty-eight of those captured were convicted of murdering women and children,
                    and hanged.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Though there were no horses in America when the white men came, the
                    Indians of the plains now have a race of small ponies, acquired long ago from
                    the early Spanish conquerors of Mexico. The plains Indians flight on horseback,
                    and are said to be "the best light cavalry in the world." They were in the habit
                    of committing their outrages on the settlements in the summer, when there was
                    grass for the ponies. In the winter, when the ponies were almost starved, they
                    took shelter in remote valleys, and counted themselves safe from attack, on
                    account of the difficulty the white men found in moving wagon-trains. But, in
                    November, 1868, General Sheridan sent General Custer, after the snow had fallen,
                    to attack the hostile Indians in their villages. Custer, carrying his provisions
                    on mules, followed the trial of a war party, under the chief Black Kettle, to
                    their town on the Washita [wau'-she-taw] River, in the Indian Territory, and
                    fell upon the sleeping savages at daybreak, defeating them with great slaughter.
                    This battle terrified and subdued the Indians of the Southern plains, who no
                    longer felt safe from punishment in their winter retreats.</p>

                    are always worsted in the long run. The irresistible march of civilized man has
                    destroyed the buffaloes, or bisons, and broken down the old life of the Indians,
                    to which they were so much attached. All the hunting-grounds will soon be
                    occupied by farms, mines, and cities. There is nothing left for the Indians but
                    to become civilized or to perish. Good men are now trying to protect them from
                    wrong, and to persuade them to have their children taught to live the lives of
                    civilized people, on farms, owned not by the tribes, but by individuals. Many
                    Indian children are taught at the expense of the government. Some of the tribes
                    located in the Indian Territory have attained considerable civilization.</p>

                    from the rich farms of the great interior valley, and meat from the
                    cattle-ranges of the Western States and Territories, are sent across the sea in
                    vast quantities. Gold and silver from the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific coast,
                    petroleum from the neighborhood of the Alleghany Mountains, and inexhaustible
                    supplies of coal and iron in various regions are great sources of wealth.
                    Manufactures of many kinds also enrich the people. The United States is already

                    how to do things that they have never seen anybody do before. Americans are,
                    perhaps, the most inventive people in the world. Before the Revolution, Thomas
                    Godfrey, of Philadelphia, invented the quadrant, an instrument to help a
                    navigator to find his whereabouts at sea. About the same time Franklin invented
                    the lightning-rod. There was also a valuable machine invented in South Carolina
                    for doing the hard labor of taking the bull off of the grains of rice. This was
                    run by the ebbing and flowing of the tide. In the middle colonies flour-mills
                    were improved, and little elevating machines invented, so that wheat did not
                    have to be carried to the top of the mill on a man's back.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">America has since become celebrated for what are called labor-saving
                    machines. One of the most remarkable of these is the cotton-gin. It took so much
                    time and toil to pick the seeds out of cotton that only small quantities were
                    raised for home use. Long before the Revolution, a "gin" for cleaning the cotton
                    of seed had been invented, but it did not come into general use. But, when
                    machines for spinning cotton thread and weaving cotton cloth by steam-power were
                    invented in England, there sprang up a great demand for raw cotton. In 1794 Eli
                    Whitney invented a "saw-gin" for taking the seeds out of cotton. This made
                    cotton-raising profitable, and caused the Southern States to grow rapidly in
                    population and wealth. After the invention of the gin, indigo-culture was quite
                    driven out by cotton-raising.</p>

                    machines, partly or wholly invented in this country. Reaping-and mowing-machines
                    were first made successful by American inventors. Thrashing-machines were
                    improved here. All the agricultural machines now used have practically been
                    introduced in the last fifty years. The first really successful sewing-machine
                    was introduced by Elias Howe in 1845. Morse's telegraph (Chapter XLV) came into
                    use at about the same time. The telephone, a recent invention, enables people to
                    hold conversation when far apart. The phonograph record speech on a cylinder,
                    which may be sealed up and kept for a thousand years, when it can be made to
                    repeat the very tones of the voice that spoke the words.</p>

                    from that of our forefathers, who had only saddle-horses or wagons for
                    land-conveyance, and slow-sailing ships or row-boats for water-journeys. We can
                    go around the world in a great deal less time than some of the first emigrants
                    took to sail from England to America. Our ancestors had neither kerosene-oil,
                    gas, nor electric light. Stoves were practically unknown; for warming themselves
                    and cooking their food, people in old times had only wood-fires in wide, open
                    fire-places, which often chilled the room with draughts of air or filled it with
                    smoke. They carded, spun, wove, and dyed, by hand, wool or flax for their own
                    clothing. Now steam is made to do most of the work in spinning and weaving, in
                    making hats and shoes, in planning boards, and in turning wood. Even delicate
                    little things like watches are made mostly by steam machinery.</p>

                    Many people are able in this way to labor on the same piece of work, each doing
                    his own part. This saves time, and makes each man's toil more productive. The

                    and won praise for its author on both sides of the Atlantic. But Irving's most

                    poems, of which "The Last Leaf" and "The One-Hoss Shay" are two of the best
                    known. His prose work, "The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table," is thought to be
                    one of the brightest books in our literature.</p>

                    attained a world-wide fame. James Fenimore Cooper was born in New Jersey in
                    1783. His novels are mostly stories, full of action and adventure. The most
                    famous are those known as "The Leather-Stocking Tales." A very different writer
                    is Nathaniel Hawthrone, who was a rare genius, and wrote stories of a weird and
                    subtile kind. Of these, "The Scarlet Letter" and "The House of the Seven Gables"
                    are general favorites.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">It is yet too soon to speak personally of the writers who have risen
                    in this country since the civil war. They differ from those who came before
                    them, as American life differs from the 1ife before the war: I. The writers of
                    this later period are not chiefly a group of men about New York or Boston. Every
                    great natural division of the country is represented in the present school of
                    writers. 2: They are not chiefly poets and essayists, like Longfellow and
                    Emerson, Poe and Irving. Our present group of authors give themselves mainly to
                    prose fiction and to humoristic writing. 3. They are remarkable for the zeal and
                    faithfulness with which they study our own life. The manners and feelings of the
                    American people in city and country are described with fullness, and the dialect
                    of every region of our United States is reproduced in the pages of our later
                    authors.</p>

                    there has been a large advance in late years, and some very notable work has
                    been done in several departments of art. In the matter of book and magazine
