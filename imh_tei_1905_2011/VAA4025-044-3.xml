            <p>In the present year of booming economic activity and inflation, it seems out of mood to discuss the
                    effects of a depression. But most economic historians who can look at the future as well as the past
                    are quite certain that this country sooner or later will again be face to face with another decline
                    of business activity. In the hope of contributing toward a better understanding of this recurrent
                    phenomenon, the writer has completed a general study of the Depression of 1819 in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, a depression usually regarded as the first of those cyclical economic disturbances
                    which have made their mark upon American development. This paper, describing the impact of that
                    depression upon the Old Northwest, is a part of the larger study.</p>
            <p>The <placeName>

                    were quite different from those which appear in a highly industrialized, interdependent economy. The
                    total population was slightly more than nine million, over eighty per cent of the people lived on
                    farms. In the Old Northwest, still a frontier community, the agrarian emphasis was even more
                    striking. <placeName>

                    seen that the total number of people affected by the Depression of 1819 in the Old Northwest was
                    relatively small—less than that of one of the larger cities of the region

                    </placeName>. The early settlements, furthermore, were located mainly in the southern and eastern

            <p>The economy of the Northwest in 1819 was essentially primitive. Agriculture was diversified, with the
                    family comprising the principal labor unit, and crops were grown chiefly for consumption rather than
                    sale. Before the economic collapse occurred, however, there was a trend toward commercial farming.
                    Considerable quantities of flour, pork, and whisky were shipped clown the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Imports into the frontier region exceeded exports, however, and created an unfavorable
                    balance of trade. Manufactured articles from Europe and the seaboard were purchased with proceeds
                    from the sale of crops, with money borrowed from banks, and with credits extended by eastern
                    commercial houses.</p>
            <p>The growing trade between the West, South, and East was sharply curtailed by the Depression of 1819.
                    This setback involved not only the limited commercial interests of the Northwest, but extended to
                    the larger agricultural community as well. The economic distress, which was general throughout the <placeName>

                    expansion of overseas markets following the end of the British blockade in 1815. The resulting high
                    prices for farm commodities attracted heavy immigration to western lands, and the new settlements
                    were financed by easy credit expansion. Public lands were sold by the federal government on an
                    installment payment basis, and speculators mingled with homesteaders in the rush to buy. The amount
                    of debt on acres bought from the government increased from $3, 042, 613.89 in 1815 to
                    $16, 794, 795.14 in 1819, while numerous local banks sprang up to finance land purchases
                    and improvements. In <placeName>

                    </placeName> alone the number of state-chartered banks increased from eight to twenty-five during
                    the three-year boom. The issue of large sums of paper money naturally resulted in price inflation,
                    and the upward spiral was accelerated by the depreciation in value of the notes of those banks whose
                    ability to redeem in specie or coin was doubtful. The traveling Scotch observer, James Flint, wrote
                    that by December, 1818, western money was in various instances thirty per cent below par in the
                    East. He explained, however, that "Tavernkeepers, grocers, and others, receive the money of
                    the banks nearest them, although they know that these banks will not pay specie for them. They see
                    that, without the rags now in circulation, they could have very little money. Everyone is afraid of
                    bursting the bubble." Prices in the Northwest rose steadily, and the increase in apparent
                    land values gave a false sense of prosperity to both farmers and speculators.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>The end of the economic boom, as well as the beginning, was related to overseas markets. By 1819, the
                    major European countries had returned to normal agricultural production after the disruption of the
                    Napoleonic Wars. They no longer required the produce imported from the <placeName>

                    establishment of a top-heavy indebtedness to Europe. With the loss of overseas export markets in

            <p>The immediate cause of the depression, especially as viewed from the Northwest, was the contraction

                    maintain a sound currency. A sound currency meant that bank notes should be redeemable in specie,
                    and practically all banks of the country had suspended specie payments since August, 1814. Soon
                    after William H. Crawford became Secretary of the Treasury, he directed the <placeName>

                    circulation. By the middle of 1819, this deflationary action had been accomplished, but in the

                    year of crisis some eighty-five banks, of a total of 392, were forced to close their doors. The
                    contraction of purchasing power not only pricked the speculative bubble, but it undermined public
                    confidence and normal business activity.</p>
            <p>The impact of depression was felt in all sections of the country. John Quincy Adams, a conservative
                    observer, recorded in May, 1819, that "the present situation and prospects of the
                    country… are alarming. The bank bubbles are breaking. The staple productions of the soil,
                    constituting our principal articles of export, are falling to half and less than half the prices
                    which they have lately borne, the merchants are crumbling to ruin, manufactures perishing,

            </p>
            <p>Economic collapse came as a special shock to the inhabitants of the Old Northwest, who had been
                    filled with growing optimism in the years following the War of 1812. The Indian menace had been
                    largely dispelled, rich lands were open to purchase on easy terms, and thousands of robust settlers
                    were moving into the region. Among these immigrants were many skilled tradesmen, who gave impetus to
                    the infant industries, which promised provincial economic independence. The success of steamboat
                    transportation brightened the prospects for commerce with the other sections of the country.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The loss of produce markets and the rapid evaporation of the currency shattered the golden dream of
                    prosperity. The full force of the depression descended upon the Northwest in 1820. James Flint wrote
                    that <placeName>

                    eighteen months earlier. Construction was almost entirely suspended while many houses stood empty.
                    So great was the unemployment, Flint declared, that many townsmen had deserted to the woods. Writing
                    from Indiana a year later, Flint estimated that he had seen upwards of fifteen hundred men looking
                    for work since the coming of hard times.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Farm prices were so low throughout the
                    Northwest that they would hardly cover the cost of freighting. Real estate values fell sharply. It
                    was reported from Marietta that depreciation ran as high as ninety per cent. Farm hands could be had
                    for as little as five dollars a month and board, but few were hired even at that wage. The
                    proportion of failures and bankruptcies was probably larger than at any time in the history of the
                    nation, and many prominent citizens were heavily involved in debt. A considerable number of <placeName>

            <p>Depression in the West temporarily checked the flow of immigrants, who had formerly brought money
                    with them into the region. The decline in immigration is suggested by the falling off in public land
                    sales. Only 804, 063.98 acres were sold in 1820, compared with 3, 491, 014.79 in 1818. It was not
                    until 1824 that settlers again ventured westward in increasing numbers. <placeName>

                    large numbers of immigrants in the Northwest was a helpful factor in the eventual recovery of the
                        region.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>If optimistic hopes for easy prosperity vanished with financial disaster, most of the inhabitants of
                    the Northwest experienced little physical suffering. The communities were predominantly
                    self-sufficient, and the collapse of trade did not mean starvation to a sturdy farmer and his
                    family. The relatively small numbers that were thrown out of work in the towns shifted back to
                    farming, which in most cases they had not completely abandoned during the boom. The scarcity of
                    money did not prevent local trading, most of which was placed on a barter basis. A few items, such
                    as tea, coffee, leather, iron, and powder, were generally held for cash sale only, but products such
                    as furs, deerskins, linen, and feathers were often accepted as cash. Other articles were usually
                    bartered, with grain being used as the principal medium of exchange in the back country. Harvest
                    hands, shoemakers, tailors, and most other workmen in those areas received their pay in grain.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>The most extensive and compelling problem of the depression in the Northwest was the liquidation of
                    debts. As a result of speculation and overenthusiasm, the per capita debt in the <geogName>Ohio

                    there was a drastic shortage of acceptable currency in the Northwest and little means of acquiring
                    more through export of produce, the land debtors faced a dilemma. In March, 1819, Indiana newspapers
                    complained bitterly of the want of land-office money, describing the situation as a public calamity
                    for the "infant state." Settlers were harder pressed than at any previous time and
                    called for an extension of the bank notes acceptable at the land offices. One account stated that
                    within six weeks executions would be in effect to the amount of all the money and receivable notes

            <p>Since the unpleasant, even painful process of debt liquidation was the principal aspect of depression
                    in the Northwest, hard times largely disappeared for individual farmers as they paid off their
                    obligations and readjusted their holdings. True economic recovery, however, in the sense of a
                    revival of purchasing power and commerce, did not come to the Northwest as a whole until about 1825.

                    years, was related to the recovery of the rest of the nation. This recovery was accomplished in part
                    through an increase in exports, especially from the cotton South, to a reviving Europe. At the same
                    time, and more important, the foundations of a new internal economy were being laid. Eastern
                    manufactures came to life and expanded quickly during the early 1820's. The growing
                    industries of the East were to provide home markets for the produce of the West. This developing
                    alignment of commerce was facilitated by completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, the commencement of <placeName>

                    of the Northwest. They saw brighter hopes of shipping their wheat, pork, beef, and other produce to
                    a market which could in turn supply western consumers with the goods they needed. The unfavorable
                    balance of trade of the West with the East, which up until 1825 prevented the establishment of a
                    sound economy in the frontier region, could at last be redressed.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A more immediate method of balancing internal imports and exports was the development of manufactures
                    within the Northwest itself. After the War of 1812, home manufactures were boosted as a means of
                    keeping purchasing power, especially gold and silver, in the region. Societies were formed for the
                    encouragement of local manufactures, and the number of these organizations increased with the coming
                    of hard times in 1819. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where the interest in manufacturing was strongest, William Henry Harrison gave his
                    personal support to the movement. Members of the societies pledged to refrain from importing
                    liquors, fruits, or preserves, and to give preference wherever possible to locally-made products. In
                    1823, the General Assembly of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, acting on the suggestion of Harrison, passed an act to exempt textile mills, ironworks
                    and glassworks from taxation. Merchants of the state were under public pressure to sell only <placeName>

                    </placeName> woolens. As one of several means of popularizing home manufactures, the practice was
                    developed at county fairs of giving prizes not only for choice livestock and produce, but also for
                    the finest glassware, the best broadcloth and flannel, and other articles of local manufacture.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> The infant industries responded to these encouragements during the early
                    1820's and led the way toward a general restoration of better times. <placeName>

            <p>The awakening interest in home industries gave rise to protectionist tariff sentiment in the states

                    agriculture, the predominant occupation of the Northwest, recovered very slowly. While planting of
                    crops was not interrupted to any substantial degree, the marketing of produce remained difficult for
                    several years. Exports to the South and East began to increase gradually in 1822 and 1823. The
                    growth of river traffic was reflected in the greater value of flour, whisky, and animal produce

                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> during those years. Commerce on the <placeName>

                    </placeName> rose by fifty per cent between 1823 and 1826, and the number of steamboats on western
                    waters rapidly increased.</p>
            <p>Wool growing, which in the Northwest was centered at Steubenville, became profitable again after the
                    recovery of the woolen mills. During the early part of the depression, the price of wool fell
                    sharply, and many fine merino sheep were slaughtered. Wool advanced somewhat in price after 1821,
                    and the demand was steady thereafter. Although by 1825 small shipments were sent from the Northwest
                    to eastern mills, most of the clip continued to be sold locally.</p>
            <p>Other industries of the Northwest, associated with agriculture, remained depressed. Lumber prices did
                    not rise substantially until after 1825, and the fur business got worse rather than better. The
                    affairs of the American Fur Company reached a critical stage by 1821. Ramsay Crooks, agent for John
                    Jacob Astor on Mackinac Island, recommended that operations be closed out because of the poor
                    market. Astor <list type="footnotes">

            <p>It might be expected that in the depressed conditions of the period the people would have turned to
                    their political representatives for remedies and assistance. Economic hardships generally produce a
                    crisis in relations between citizens and their government. What the government may or may not do has
                    an important bearing upon the course of depression and recovery. In the main, the national
                    administration sought to ignore the Depression of 1819. President James Monroe took the official
                    attitude that conditions were not serious and, in any case, were not within the sphere of government
                    action. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> was concerned only insofar as the economic situation affected the revenues of the
                    government. In order to keep the budget balanced during a period of declining receipts,
                    administrative economies were ordered, and when deficits threatened in spite of retrenchment,
                    Congress authorized the Treasury to borrow up to eight million dollars. The income of the national
                    government, which had amounted to almost fifty million dollars in 1816, fell to fifteen million
                    dollars in 1821. But after striking that low mark, the receipts picked up and exceeded normal
                    expenditures for each year following until 1837.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Retrenchment was the rule in most state governments, as well as in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The number of state employees was reduced, and salaries were lowered. In Indiana,
                    there was a move to pare expenses still further by having the legislature meet bienially instead of
                    annually. But in spite of all the economy demands and moves, the state governments were not entirely
                    deflationary in their actions. During the depression and recovery period, the various states spent
                    large sums for internal improvements, especially canals, roads, and bridges. Such expenditures were
                    not made in the Northwest until after 1825, but the movement for state-sponsored transportation
                    improvements gained strength there during the years of hard times. One of the leading proponents of
                    public works as a recovery measure was the <list type="footnotes">

                    and economy, declaring such measures to be negative rather than creative. Spending of money was

                    the same time, he argued that public works would provide the greatest spur to business ever
                    experienced in the West. Idle hands would find employment, directly or indirectly, and in a few
                    years all embarrassments would be removed.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>Although the national and state governments generally assumed a "hands-off"
                    attitude with reference to economic activity, they did take important steps toward relieving the
                    distress of their citizens. In the Northwest, the greatest hardship of the times was debt,
                    especially land debt. In response to widespread demands, Congress took effective action to alleviate
                    the burden. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> introduced the first important land relief bill, which had the support of virtually all
                    western Congressmen.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> As finally approved in March, 1821, the law provided that
                    the land debtor could apply payments already made on various tracts to outright purchase of a chosen
                    portion of his holdings.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> By relinquishing his larger claim, the farmer was
                    able to save his home and other improvements and to free himself of debt. The law provided also that
                    if the debtor could continue the payments originally agreed to, an extension of time would be
                    permitted and accrued interest would be waived. A thirty-seven per cent discount on the balance due
                    was offered for prompt settlements. The relief act of 1821 was extended in 1822 and again in
                    succeeding years, until by 1832 eleven relief acts had been passed by Congress for the benefit of
                    men who had purchased on credit before 1820. The heavy land indebtedness was thereby reduced over a
                    period of time with little injury to the settlers of the West.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                    the same time to abolish the prevailing system of sales on credit. In April, 1820, Congress passed a
                    new Land Act, which required full payment in cash for all future purchases. This act, which must be
                    regarded as an immediate consequence of the depression, was a blow to the traditional pattern of
                    settlement in the West, and was firmly opposed by the western representatives in Congress. Settlers
                    on new land after 1820 were benefited, however, by provisions of the act which lowered the minimum
                    price from $1.64 to $1.25 per acre and reduced the minimum amount that could

                    property of debtors in a period when commerce was stagnant and money scarce were passed during the

                    creditors. The debtor groups, furthermore, proved quite successful in pressing their demands upon

                    resentment in the West when it broke the speculative boom by contracting credit and forcing the
                    resumption of specie payments. More than that, after lending liberally during the expansion period,
                    the Bank made wholesale property foreclosures after the crash, and thereby came face to face with

            <p>The West was certain that the new leader should represent the new section. As early as 1821,
                    agitation was started to put a western man in the White House. Expressing the view of his region, a

                    the extent of its territory and number of inhabitants. He claimed that his section should have its
                    fair turn in office, and that the need of a special program and a liberal policy demanded a western
                    man.</p>
            <p>Henry Clay appeared to be the most logical candidate, for he had a program, the American System,
                    which was clearly suited to the needs of the West. The other leading presidential possibility was
                    Andrew Jackson, but his program was vague, and he was unpopular in his home state of <placeName>

                    wanted, above all, a "real" Westerner in the White House. Jackson became the
                    embodiment of the West in the eyes of his followers. Therefore, "it was the hero of <placeName>

                    country of a major cyclical depression. Many blamed the turn of events on the banks, eastern
                    financial interests, and general economic causes, but there were others who viewed the depression as
                    a religious, psychological, or moral phenomenon. One wrote in June, 1819, "the signs of the
                    times are great." He asserted that the many dreadful happenings were the work of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName>, going on rapidly as described in the Bible. According to another, hard times were only
                    an illusion, for the apparent distress was merely the result of a transition from false prosperity
                    to normalcy. A contributor to the <hi rend="i">Indiana Gazette</hi> rationalized the situation in
                    the following terms: "We have been nationally drunk—and we are now getting
                    sober, through an interval of languor and sickly depression." This explanation of the
                    business cycle had the merit of simplicity and is more comprehensible than many interpretations
                    which have been advanced during the past century of literature on the subject.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moral decay was widely blamed as a leading cause of hard times. Dishonesty, indolence, and especially
                    extravagance were roundly condemned. There was considerable support for the view that since unwise
                    personal habits had brought on the distress, the restoration of traditional virtues would hasten
                    recovery. One man declared that "linsey woolsey" must supplant silks and crepes,
                    and that men must come to prefer good wives who can make bread and butter to girls who can dance in
                    delicate laces. The <placeName>

                    number of public balls and to work for the interest and happiness of the domestic circle. A typical
                    feminine reply to such appeals asked why women should economize when the men would probably spend

                    <p>I take the liberty of saying a few things to you about hard times. Now-a-days when we meet one
                        another we have nothing to say but to repeat the old complaint of hard times. When we have got
                        through the fatiguing labors of the day, and sit down with our wives and children about us in
                        the evening, instead of calculating our gains and cheering our boys and girls by promising Bill
                        and Bob a hat, and Molly and Katey a new dress after harvest and sale of our crops, we have only
                        to amuse ourselves and them with the story of hard times. If we go to town, although we are
                        invited to try a little corn as usual, and meet with the same feeling enquiries from our
                        friends, the store keepers, as formerly, about our "concerns at home;" before
                        we leave their store we are sure to be winked aside and called on for "a small balance
                        of some time standing which ought to be paid."</p>
                    <p>Well, it is true the times are hard enough. Two or three years ago we could get a dollar a bushel
                        for our wheat, and for our pork and beef four or five dollars per hundred. Then our farms were
                        worth something, and we could always, by some means or other, raise a little money to meet
                        "a balance of some time standing which ought to be paid." Now we can get
                        little or nothing for our wheat, our pork and our cattle. And as for our farms, we could hardly
                        give them away. In fact, it is so difficult to get money that all "balances, "
                        whether for or against us, bid fair to remain "outstanding" for a long time to
                        come….</p>

                        much corn both at home and when we are from home. There are a great many farmers as well as
                        others in our country who are becoming, as one might say, habitual drunkards, and who are in a

            <p>Even before the coming of the white man, the custom of giving and receiving presents had been
                    observed for many years among the Indian confederacies settled along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and Northwest frontiers. Among the aborigines, the exchange of the calumet pipe,
                    wampum, clothing, beaver pelts, and other articles was especially important during public meetings.
                    Subsequent conferences between the natives and the whites adhered to the custom of exchanging gifts
                    during the years, 1748-1763.</p>
            <p>The Jesuits and the early French explorers emphasized the significance of presents in dealing with
                    the aborigines. A particularly important present was the mystic calumet pipe. The bestowal of this
                    pipe, with its long stem occasionally wrapped with wampum, was sufficient cause even for the
                    cessation of hostilities among tribes which had been at war. The Algonquian Indians had such a
                    veneration for the pipe that a violation of the "law of the calumet" was an
                    offense that could not be pardoned.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the aborigines, wampum, like the calumet pipe, was a symbolic present whose mystic connotations
                    were never fully understood by the whites. Beads or grains, which were laboriously carved from
                    shells collected along the Atlantic coast, were carried westward as far as the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. These beads served a great number of purposes. Some were laced in rectangular patterns
                    upon belts. When delivered at treaties, each so-called belt, some more than six feet in length,
                    served as an official "statement" or "word." Beads were also
                    placed on single strings of leather. These <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Scalps, hatchets, blankets, and food were other types of presents given by the natives, each of which
                    had a definite purpose. Among the Algonquian Indians, for example, the calumet served as a kind of
                    record of previous agreements, while wampum was used for the same purpose in the Iroquoian
                    confederacy. All tribes appear to have acknowledged the importance of the hatchet or ax as a present
                    to be used in the declaration of war. To "bury the hatchet, " especially in the

            <p>In addition, the channeling of Indian presents through trading posts offered an opportunity for
                    graft, and apparently few Canadian officials hesitated to cheat their government.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> At the government posts large quantities of goods earmarked as presents for the Indians
                    never reached the natives. One official complained, that "certificates of presents
                    pretended to have been made to the Indians, are accepted without any
                        examination…."<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Individuals who had monopolies on
                    trading posts purchased the king's stores and charged their expenses to the government,

            <p>This financial scramble was further complicated by the unscrupulous individuals who used liquor to

                    resold to the government. Thus the Indians were "continually craving" for presents
                    and brandy, and the king might indefinitely repurchase goods to be used for gifts. The astute
                    Montcalm noted that the immense profits made by "officers, storekeepers, [and]

                    upon the Indians, the natives also received various manufactured goods. The <hi rend="i">Aouapou</hi> was a native word used by the Canadians "to denote the complete suit of

                    "a short skirt called the petticoat (machicotté)" was substituted for
                    the breechcloth. In winter, the native allies had to be supplied with what the Canadians called the

            <p>It was also the practice of the king's agents to present the sachems with beautiful scarlet

            <p>Although the stroud, a cheap woolen cloth made of rags, was almost an English monopoly, the French
                    did allot this material for blankets and clothing. The tribesmen were also presented with a host of
                    other textiles and articles of clothing. Among these were gaily colored calicoes, hats laced with
                    tinsel and trimmed with large feathers of attractive hues, ruffled and plain shirts, handkerchiefs,

            <p>Not all presents were of a peaceful nature, however. A grim note is sounded by such donations as

                    as British men-of-war caused many of the French vessels either to turn back or be captured. In 1757,

                    continually complaining about the scarcity of Indian merchandise and the high prices that resulted

                            both of these brothers were captured by Sir William Johnson at Niagara in 1759. An excellent
                            example of Chabert's success with the Seneca is found in a record of a conference
                            between the French and the sachems of that "nation." To show his
                            allegiance to the French one of the chiefs declared, "I forget that there are any

                    Amherst in regard to the matter of presents caused Indian discontent among the western and northern
                    confederacies between 1760 and 1763.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Amherst felt that after the conquest of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> the Indians should once again hunt and earn their livelihood. For this reason, he
                    sliced expenses for gifts at every opportunity.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Because the warriors missed
                    the "kindly presents" of the French, Pontiac was able to make the most of Indian
                    discontent. After the long wars the western Indians were practically destitute of goods and
                    supplies, especially powder and arms for hunting purposes. Yet, it was these very items that the
                    British withheld from them. Trouble inevitably resulted, and no less an authority than Sir William
                    Johnson pointed out that this penchant for economy in regard to presents was largely responsible for
                    Pontiac's conspiracy.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> Thus, it would seem that lack of French
                    presents after 1760 was to a surprising degree responsible for the Indian rebellion under Pontiac.
                    Presents had been used by both the French and the English to secure native friendship and alliances,
                    but in the end the Indian had to shift for himself.</p>

            <p>Having recently joined in completing a biographical and bibliographical encyclopedia of the first
                    century of Indiana writers some of us know what many have suspected—there has been much
                    writing done in the state of Indiana!</p>
            <p>In quality much of it was average—pretty good grist for the average publisher's
                    mill, some of it was bad and colorless (which is a depressing kind of badness—but by no
                    means limited to Indiana), and a little of it was of an inspired and masterful kind of badness which
                    some enjoy very much. The third category of Indiana writing was that which was exceedingly
                    good—and there was an astonishing amount of it. There has been variety of form and
                    subject matter a plenty.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it seemed that the bulk of all Hoosier output had been poetry. An analysis would scarcely
                    prove this to be the case, but one would not have been surprised, had it turned out
                    so—for every true Hoosier, when he isn't busy playing politics or cussing the
                    weather, tries his hand at poetry. (Most likely that is because James Whitcomb Riley made it all
                    look so very easy.)</p>
            <p>At any rate, there was much verse ranging in quality and subject matter from "Little <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> Hands" through "The Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight" and
                    "The Monon Wreck" to Will Thompson's "High Tide at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>."</p>
            <p>Reform, of one kind or another, was a favorite choice of subject also. In the early years, religious
                    sectarianism received most attention. Several decades of vituperation were required before Baptists
                    were willing to admit that there might be one Methodist in heaven (maybe just a little one, who
                    wasn't quite bright and hadn't really known what was going on), and Methodists
                    became reconciled to Campbellites, at least to the point where they would swap horses or borrow
                    money from them.</p>
            <p>About the time this Utopian state of affairs came about, a new and different evangelical wave hit the
                    state, and the Indiana scribes brandished their pens again. In the thirties some one in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> had discovered that alcohol, used as a beverage, seemed to be sometimes associated with
                    unpleasant manifestations—domestic, moral, or physical. Word of this startling discovery
                    eventually reached the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="258" id="VAA4025-044-3-036"/> finally filtered through even to Indiana. Some people in the
                    state (probably with impaired digestive systems) began to take the business seriously and before
                    long exhorters canceled their previous commitments and took the stump in behalf of this novel
                    theory: the Temperance Movement was under-weigh.</p>
            <p>Of course, pamphlets, books, and tracts had to be written to fortify the orators and the resulting
                    literature proved quite attractive to readers sated with the sweetness and light of the pieces in
                        <hi rend="i">The Family Magazine</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Ladies' Repository.</hi> In
                    temperance tracts, there could be blood-curdling statistics showing how many men beat how many wives
                    in the city of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> alone in a given year, and how many wives died of it. It was possible to demonstrate,
                    with interesting details, how many girls went wrong in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> through the use of malt beverages, and how many people went insane and in what
                    intriguing ways their insanity manifested itself. The Indian temperance tract was a
                    nineteenth-century counterpart of <hi rend="i">True Confessions Magazine</hi>, with touches of <hi rend="i">FOP ever Amber</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Lost Weekend.</hi> It was considered by our
                    Hoosier ancestors to be right peart readin'.</p>
            <p>Of all the fields of writing invaded by Hoosiers, those of fiction and biography certainly resulted
                    in the greatest artistic—and financial—success.</p>
            <p>Some effete Easterner has intimated that Indiana writers turn to fiction as an escape from the utter
                    desolation of the Indiana scene. Of course that is a base canard. Hoosiers need no escape,
                    psychological or physical. Did any Hoosier, author or otherwise, ever leave the old state except
                    maybe to make more money? Or at worst to act as a missionary to the seaboards, East or West?</p>
            <p>Let the reviewers and essayists attribute the cause as they wish, the fact still remains that Indiana
                    authors of fiction ran second only to those of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> state (with an average five times the population) between 1895 and 1945, and by a
                    microscopic margin at that!</p>
            <p>True enough, poetry, religion and reform, fiction, and biography supplied subject matter for the bulk
                    of the output —but the writing of history has not been without its strong men in the
                    state. There are Wilbur Cortez Abbott (whose work on the Cromwellian Period will still be standard a
                    century from now), Frederick Austin Ogg, Claude Bowers, and, most prolific of the moderns, Charles
                    A. and Mary Ritter <pb n="259" id="VAA4025-044-3-037"/> Beard.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Even John Clark
                    Ridpath and John H. Beadle, hacks though they were, must be credited with selling a great many
                    books, whatever their stature. These were (or are), however, professional historians, and it is upon
                    the amateurs that emphasis is to be placed.</p>
            <p>Perhaps one should first settle the question "Who is an amateur historian?" My
                    definition of the term is this. An "amateur" historian is one without formal
                    training in the field, who is engaged in some other activity for a livelihood, and who carries on
                    research and writing as an avocation.</p>
            <p>Greatest of the amateurs in nineteenth-century Indiana was certainly John Brown Dillon,
                    tragic—perhaps even, in his later years, repulsive—figure, he was
                    Indiana's first great scholar of history (amateur or professional) and, after a century,
                    still occupies a position which is very high indeed.</p>
            <p>Dillon and the strange, lonely life he led were the subject of conjecture and discussion wherever he
                    was known in his own day—and precious little factual matter about his past ever rewarded
                    his contemporaries. No one seems ever really to have known John Dillon, as most men are known to
                    their fellows.</p>

                    before he was orphaned, at nine, and bound out to a printer to learn the trade. By his eighteenth

            <p>Those may not be great lines but that was a sentimental day and over-florid verse was flowing from
                    pens more experienced than young John Dillon's. The poem is certainly marked by the gentle,
                    hopeless melancholy which seemed, to his contemporaries, to have set the pattern of his character
                    and, in their tragic implication, to offer explanation enough for the lonely life he chose to lead
                    thereafter.</p>

                    subject considerably beyond what was considered essential for the blossoming lawyer in those free
                    and easy days, for his writing on colonial and territorial jurisprudence and legislation in his book

            <p>No matter what his qualifications may have been, he did not practice at the bar. Instead he joined

                    may suppose that Dillon was editor and mechanical foreman, while the Lasselle family

                    book is to be found research as thorough, establishment of sources as satisfactory, and an
                    exposition as clear and logical as the first half of the nineteenth century saw in America.</p>
            <p>His work was undoubtedly forwarded by the almost monastic life he led. John Dillon had no close
                    friends and no attachments to bias his reporting when he interviewed survivors of the events he
                    described or examined their letters and records. He said "I have endeavored to keep my mind
                    free… either from ambitious contentions between distinguished men… false
                    traditions., national partialities and antipathies… or from dissensions among
                    uncharitable teachers of different creeds of religion; and thus to qualify myself, in some measure,
                    for the work of compiling and writing an impartial history…."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was probably in this detachment that his chief virtue lay: John Dillon himself had no
                    "ambitious contentions"; the "distinction" of no man meant
                    anything to him; he had no "partiality," no "antipathy" and no
                    particular "creed of religion." It is fortunate that in addition to these rather
                    negative advantages, he also had the methodical repertorial attitude combined with a sense of the
                    important and the dramatic.</p>
            <p>Given such qualifications and being located (as he was in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>

                    Northwest and the Indiana territories, with many men still alive who had known the strenuous days
                    and were happy to talk of them, it should have been fairly easy for Dillon to produce a book of
                    pioneer reminiscence. How he then knew of, and how he managed to consult, the obscure published
                    sources and the official records which he used to make his book also a satisfying and
                    well-documented history of the Territory is a matter at which one may well marvel.</p>
            <p>In 1845, Dillon was appointed Indiana State Librarian. It was not a lucrative position but Dillon,
                    thinking of the reading and research which could be pursued among even such a modest collection of
                    books as the State Library offered— it was largely law and legislative
                    material—must have found the prospect irresistible.</p>

                    failing health prevented a final revision, perhaps because John Dillon's mind had become so
                    cluttered with the store of historical and legislative lore with which he had crammed it that he had
                    lost the power to select pertinent matter and to arrange it.</p>

                    their vast content of books, notes, and manuscripts than for either comfort or
                    cleanliness—in which his life had been spent. There he died on February 27, 1879, alone,
                    as he had lived, respected—even honored—by the more discerning of his
                    contemporaries but loved by no one.</p>
            <p>Perhaps his acquaintances were right, perhaps John Dillon's capacity to love and to be loved

            <p>Before John B. Dillon, printer-turned-historian, in time (but not in significance) came John Law,
                    attorney and judge, with one good performance as a historian to his credit.</p>
            <p>John Law was an example of a type more common to neighboring <placeName>

                    support behind him, came west for the purpose of making a career in the new country.</p>
            <p>Law was born in New <placeName>

                    country might be expected to welcome a young lawyer with a genuine college education, and where a
                    man could invest a little money in a very large estate, should he so desire. Very shortly he arrived
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

            <p>Oliver H. Smith (who was not in the habit of exaggerating the virtues of his fellows) called John Law
                    " A noble specimen of our race—fine looking, urbane, kind, hospitable and
                    generous." Law attracted immediate and favorable attention and a few clients as well.
                    Shortly, he was elected prosecuting attorney (then, as now, the springboard from which a young
                    lawyer, could best take off on a legal career), and in 1823 he was elected to the state legislature,
                    which, in turn, elected him judge of the Seventh Judicial Circuit. He retired from the circuit bench
                    after only a year, however, to resume private practice.</p>
            <p>He had married Sarah Ewing, daughter of prosperous Nathanial, receiver of the local Government Land
                    Office. His law practice was profitable, he served as a receiver of public monies himself during the <placeName>

                    seven hundred acres now occupied by a part of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana) and eventually was appointed to the Federal Bench. All in all, Law's
                    early appraisal of the opportunities in Indiana was justified. He did quite well here.</p>
            <p>It was as an attorney at the bar that he enjoyed his greatest success—with the exception
                    of one single case, which he eventually won, although it was in court almost fifty years and both he
                    and his client were dead before it was decided in their favor.</p>
            <p>The client was Francois Vigo, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> capitalist of the Revolutionary War period, who had made the mistake of advancing

                    gazing toward the town in which he waited until his death to collect his due and was disappointed.</p>
            <p>Law's historical writing began with his <hi rend="i">Address Delivered Before the <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                        </placeName> Historical and Antiquarian Society</hi>, February 22, 1839, of which he had two

                  <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. This
                    address on the early history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, eleven or twelve thousand words in length, antedated Dillon's book by four
                    years and seems to be the first effort at scholarly historical writing completed in the state.</p>
            <p>The work was widely circulated (Dillon himself mentions having used it) and in 1858 Law republished
                    it—with the addition of explanatory matter, much of which is of value— in
                    clothbound octavo under the title <hi rend="i">The Colonial History of <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                        </placeName>, Under the French, British and American Governments.</hi>… It is
                    interesting to note that Law also beat Dillon into print with his revision, antedating
                    Dillon's, this time, by only a year, however.</p>
            <p>Law's address, and also the material he added for the revised edition, is well-organized,
                    well-documented, well-written, and also includes references to some remarkably obscure sources. An
                    amusing change is noticeable, however, between the literary style of attorney John Law, who wrote
                    the address in 1839, and that of the Honorable (Federal) Judge Law who amended it in 1858. The first
                    is plain and straight forward, the second is flowery and adorned with much Latin, considerable
                    French which was not very sound, and an occasional classical allusion. Federal Judge Law,
                    "urbane, kind… and benevolent" gentleman that he was, seems to have
                    felt the weight of his improved position in society.</p>
            <p>Third of the amateurs, and to me the most delightful, is schoolmaster-historian Sandford C. Cox. It,
                    must not be assumed that, in his schoolmastering, Cox endangered his amateur standing as a
                    historian. History was a furbelow not considered appropriate to the
                    reading-and-writing-and-arithmetic curriculum of the eighteen twenties to the eighteen fifties
                    period, and it is doubtful if either Cox or his pupils <pb n="265" id="VAA4025-044-3-043"/> ever
                    wasted a classroom hour on it. In my opinion, he is as virgin an amateur as either a printer or a
                    lawyer could possibly be.</p>
            <p>Sandford C. Cox appears upon his own biographical scene at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1824, an observant lad of fourteen or so. He reports himself as having come by wagon
                    with his parents, brothers, and sisters from the Whitewater Valley by way of the Falls of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fall Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Strawtown— Thorntown Trace.</p>
            <p>Sandford's eye missed very little. He had seen four men awaiting hanging at the Falls for
                    what must have appeared to most of the populace to be merely the thoughtless misdemeanor of killing
                    a few Indians; he saw land speculators, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, sporting phenomenal watch chains and white beaver hats; he saw mud; overflowing
                    taverns; mud; recently retired Indian fighters; mud; hundreds of movers' wagons; mud, and
                    more mud.</p>
            <p>He must have had some education before he left the Whitewater—where schools were
                    comparatively plentiful due to the efforts of the Quakers—for within two years he himself
                    became a tender-aged schoolmaster and continued to follow that business in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Montgomery</region>, <region type="county">Fountain</region>, <region type="county">Warren</region>

                    </placeName> counties during most of his life.</p>
            <p>Unlike many of his contemporaries in the teaching profession—whose first interest was
                    tuition money and whose second was often the fiddle and sometimes the jug—Cox seems
                    always to have cherished literary ambitions. He wrote long and interesting accounts of the new
                    country to his friends (apparently going to the trouble of keeping copies of them), and by 1833
                    began to contribute verse to local newspapers. The contribution of verse to newspapers is a certain
                    indication of faithful and disinterested wooing of the muse. Newspaper editors did not pay for poems
                    then, anymore than they do today, and there was (and is) more likely to be discredit than glory for
                    the poet in the eyes of his neighbors.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 1859, most of the early settlers having been called on to fairer fields, it occurred
                    to Cox that his letters and notes on the pioneer day might make interesting reading for the public.
                    He had associated with leading men in the middle <geogName>Wabash Valley</geogName>, and his keen
                    interest in human frailties had prompted him to become acquainted also with those at the opposite
                    end of the social scale. Besides he had seen <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-044-3-044"/> the
                    "Indian Murderers" at the Falls with his own eyes and his grandfather, Richard
                    Rue, had told him the otherwise unrecorded story of the captivity of himself, Irvin Hinton, and
                    George Holman by Indians under the leadership of the notorious Simon Girty.</p>
            <p>Cox published his series of articles in the <placeName>

                    appeared in 1860. The book was good, and it is still good today—far better than either
                    Cox or his contemporaries probably suspected.</p>
            <p>Dillon's work is based upon elaborate and painstaking research, as, to a lesser extent, is
                    Law's. Cox had need to consult no archives, to read no books, to interview no pioneers, to
                    search no newspaper files. His sources were his own notes and letters, jotted down as the incidents
                    of which he wrote were occurring (except for grandfather Rue's yarn, of course) and all of
                    it done simply for the fun of the business.</p>
            <p>Dillon is venerated as the first to carry on really extensive historical research in the state and as
                    the author of historical works which still hold their own in scholarly authority. Law should be
                    honored for his priority of appearance in print as an Indiana historical writer. But for a view of
                    the Hoosiers as they looked and lived; of the Indiana scene in, as it were; full color; and for
                    genuine reading pleasure, Cox, the Black Creek Schoolmaster, is deserving of whatever special diadem
                    is awarded for such homely virtue.</p>
            <p>It is not likely that any of the three appreciated his own importance as a historian in his own
                    lifetime. Probably all three gentlemen—printer, lawyer, and schoolmaster—if
                    they happen to be gazing down from their heavenly home upon the Hoosier scene today, have first
                    raised their halos and scratched their brows in amazement then summoned all the little cherubim to
                    gather 'round and marvel at the sight of others listening to their simple stories so

            <p>Security against want was a desideratum as prevalent in the nineteenth century as it is today, though
                    it was expressed in different phraseology. Today one asks "freedom from want" for
                    all. In the second third of the nineteenth century, however, every family dreamed of owning its own
                    home, which it could call the family homestead, and of having some guarantee that this home would
                    not be taken from it in times of economic distress. The possession of a homestead, it was felt,
                    would be the best guaranty of economic security.</p>
            <p>It was this desire to combat economic insecurity and to prevent the recurrence of the scenes
                    witnessed during the depression which followed the panic of 1837 when family after family was turned
                    off the land it had cleared or tilled for years, that gave birth to the idea of homestead exemption.

            <p>The homestead exemption was a legal device that reserved the family abode, sometimes within certain
                    specific limits of acreage and monetary valuation and sometimes merely within the limits of a
                    "reasonable amount of property," from distraint for debt.</p>

            <p>Homestead exemptions were demanded by the land reformers, organized into the National Reform
                    Association, as a part of the agrarian doctrine of natural rights which its adherents hoped would
                    prove to be a universal panacea. They believed that man has a natural right to use the materials of
                    nature necessary to his existence. Hence, light, air, water, and soil are man's natural
                    material rights. Every natural right has three cardinal points—individuality,
                    inalienability, and equality. In the doctrine of the natural right to the soil, individuality was to
                    be secured by freedom of the public lands (i.e., ownership of part of the public domain to be
                    granted gratuitously to actual settlers), inalienability was to be obtained by homestead exemption,
                    and equality was to be attained by land limitation.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> On the frontier, however,
                    homestead exemptions were desired in order to encourage the settlement of the wilderness.
                    Everywhere, the debtor element of society sought to secure homestead exemptions in order to promote
                    their own interests. Then, too, homestead exemptions were regarded as promoting democracy by
                    fostering a spirit of security which helped preserve a feeling of freedom and independence so
                    essential to the continuance of democracy.</p>
            <p>In Indiana, homestead exemption was written into the new constitution of 1851 as a result of three
                    movements— the agitation for improving the lot of the debtor, the crusade for changes in
                    the public land policy, along with the steady trend towards humanitarian and democratizing reforms
                    characteristic of the temper of the times.</p>
            <p>The exemption from execution of a fixed amount of real, as well as personal, property was one of the
                    constitutional amendments proposed by individual citizens, the press, and public meetings prior to
                    the calling of the revision convention.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Due to the popularity of this reform,
                    both major political parties supported the measure.</p>

            <p>The Democrats had as their spokesman the chief executive of the state. Governor Paris C. Dunning,<hi rend="sup">4</hi> in his annual message to the last legislative session preceding the assembling
                    of the constitutional convention, said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Believing that the interest and welfare of our country demand greater security to the

                            recommended that such a change be made in our execution laws (to operate prospectively) as
                            will exempt from execution and sale, in favor of any resident defendant and his family, a

                            homestead, or so much thereof as it will embrace. The details of such a law are left to the
                            better judgment of the General Assembly. Should a law embracing this humane principle not
                            meet with favor at the present session of the General Assembly, I trust that before the next

                            the Divine Law— that such a provision in our Constitution would tend to repress,
                            in this country, that fatal abuse so long existing in the systems of the old world,
                            overgrown land monopoly (the fruitful source of bloodshed and attempted

                            just, and glorious institutions of our beloved country. Adopting the language of Mr.
                            Jefferson, we declare, "Our national independence will never be complete till the

            <p>These excerpts indicated that the Democrats and the Whigs were interested in homestead exemptions as

            <p>That the influence of the National Reform Association was felt in Indiana may also be gleaned from
                    the discussion in the constitutional convention of 1850-1851. The land reformers were referred to,
                    and the speeches of some of the delegates were worded in terminology that might have been uttered by
                    the land reformers themselves. A good illustration of their influence was the following extract from
                    the address delivered on November 25, 1850, by Judge James W. Borden, who from 1857 to 1863 held the

            <p>But the work of the National Reform Association was only one of the factors causing the adoption of
                    homestead exemption in Indiana. Another reason why the property exemption article was agreed to by
                    the Indiana convention was the endeavor to solve the debtor problem.</p>
            <p>The homestead exemption provision had as its goal the "humane object" of helping
                    the honest but impoverished debtor by preserving a home to his wife and children and by ensuring to
                    him the means whereby he might, through energy and industry, regain his financial solvency, declared
                    the members of the constituent assembly. Its connection with the debtor question was also
                    demonstrated by its position in the constitution for it was placed in the same section as, though
                    just before, the clause abolishing imprisonment for debt. And, indeed, the exemption article itself
                    asserted that its purpose was to recognize "the privilege of the debtor to enjoy the
                    necessary comforts of life."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>The exponents of exemption believed the measure was as wise as it was humanitarian, in conformity
                    with the enlightenment of the age and the spirit of democratic institutions. It was essential to
                    protect the poor because they were the most numerous class in society, because "it is the
                    poor, principally, who labor, and labor only produces wealth," and because the poor were
                    "our main reliance, our main support, both in Peace and in War" adding to the
                    country's wealth in peacetime through their labor and furnishing in wartime the armies to
                    defend the nation. The supporters of property exemption also thought that it would promote
                    prosperity and patriotism and would secure greater obedience to law and a larger degree of
                        democracy.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The opponents of this constitutional measure, however, regarded it as "unethical,"
                    as "legal swindling," as a creator of idleness and denied that it would foster
                    either prosperity or patriotism. "I hold that property makes a man no more virtuous or
                    patriotic than he is without it," said the lawyer, Samuel Pepper, who was at one time
                    attorney for <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Crawford County</region>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> It would not be "conducive to public morals to place
                    that class comparatively above want by giving them homesteads—homesteads purchased with
                    the funds of other men," asserted Alvin P. Hovey. He also maintained that the proposed
                    exemption would legalize fraud. He illustrated this contention with the case of two friends, one of
                    whom had five hundred dollars in cash and the other had nothing. The penniless person would borrow
                    the five hundred dollars from his friend and would buy a homestead with it. When his friend needed
                    the money and asked him to return it, the friend would be informed of the manner in which it had
                    been invested and would be told that the money could not be regained because of the homestead
                    exemption principle. The exemption, Hovey insisted, would close credit to the poor. Moreover, argued
                    Hovey, the exemption would breed laziness for what incentive would a man deeply indebted have
                    "to acquire anything above his mere homestead? None! <list type="footnotes">

                    carrying such principles into practice." He confessed to the correctness of the abstract
                    principle that all men were created free and equal, but denied that any inference could be drawn
                    from that entitling Negroes to the same privileges and immunities as whites or admitting women to
                    the same political rights enjoyed by men since expediency condemned such a course of action.

            <p>These views were refuted by the adherents of homestead exemption who claimed it would result in a
                    greater obedience to law by delivering the debtor from the dire distress that caused him to resort
                    to fraud and led him to crime. They denied that the exemption provision would inspire men to the
                    recourse of subterfuge to avoid paying debts. They pointed out that the belief that fear of the
                    stringent collection laws and of prison made men pay their debts was false since thousands of
                    dollars were repaid without the aid of the law while comparatively few debts were collected by the
                    coercion of the law. On the contrary, they felt that a constitutional exemption clause would

            <p>The proponements of property exemption declared that it would foster prosperity by facilitating the
                    obtaining of credit by the poor, by stimulating immigration into the state, and by destroying land
                    monopoly and increasing the number of small freeholders.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> They reminded the
                    convention that the argument that credit would be closed to the poor had been raised when the
                    movement to abolish imprisonment for debt was started and the success of that reform proved the
                    fallacy of that viewpoint. They were positive that homestead exemption would make it easier for the
                    poor to get credit as it would increase the ability of the debtor to pay and would give greater
                    security to the creditor. Moreover, they proclaimed that the lack of homestead exemption law had
                    hitherto repressed immigration into Indiana. Foreign emigrants coming to the west settled in states
                    having liberal homestead exemption laws. The immigrant knows, said Colfax, "that if he
                    casts his lot with us, the humble home he may purchase for his family may be swept away from them,
                    if an acclimating sickness or any other temporary misfortune may happen to them. He knows and sees

            <p>The promoters of homestead exemption were certain that their proposition would, in the words of

                            while THE FEW owned the lands and THE MANY were serfs or tenants. But in this age, for men

                            a deeper, stronger interest in the social progress of the neighborhood, in the peace, the

            <p>Furthermore, those who favored property exemption felt it would help safeguard democracy by
                    instilling in the poor a spirit of independence and by preventing creditors from exerting an undue
                    influence upon their debtors at election time. James Dick told his colleagues: "It is our
                    duty as freemen, in order to sustain our liberties and to continue them, to guard against the
                    influences of wealth over the necessities of the poor, and through this conservative system, sir, to

            </p>
            <p>The advocates of homestead exemption also argued that it would promote patriotism, for a home
                    inalienably secured by law would make a man feel a deeper interest in his country's safety
                    and welfare. John B. Niles asserted: "Those will love their country who love their homes.
                    Protect them in their homes and they shall defend their country, her laws and
                        institutions."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> A similar sentiment was expressed by Elias Murray,
                    who maintained that <quote rend="blockquote">

                            strengthen the government, and give dignity and comfort to her citizens, but it will insure
                            industry, abate poverty and pauperism, and redeem vast multitudes from want and

            <p>John B. Howe, former educator, lawyer, legislator and future banker and author, voiced the view that
                    there was "a practical argument stronger and better than any other that can be made in
                    favor of homestead exemption—it is the argument of experience." To support this
                    statement, it was shown that the principle of property exemption in the form of chattel exemptions
                    had been embodied in the laws of Indiana for the past twenty-five years, and the amount of personal
                    property reserved from distraint by these statutes had been increased steadily from fifty to one
                    hundred and twenty-five dollars.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> The example of the personal and real estates
                    freed from levy for debts by the legislation and constitutional provisions of other states were also
                    cited. Howe quoted the following article from the <hi rend="i">National Intelligencer</hi> to

                                    concurred in and published an address to the people of the state summarizing the
                                    most important amendments made to the old constitution and explaining where they
                                    deemed it necessary, the reasons for these proposed changes. Of the exemption
                                    section, they said: The Principles of exempting a reasonable amount of the property

                                    There is no provision of this kind in the old Constitution; though the present law,
                                    usually called the 'hundred and twenty-five dollar law', is based
                                    upon the principle thus proposed to be ermanently established." <hi rend="i">Ibid.</hi>, II, 2042; Kettleborough, <hi rend="i">Constitution Making

            <p>Consequently, the desire to assist the debtor, to promote patriotism and prosperity, to foster
                    democracy and good government, and to lessen crime, as well as the effective propaganda of the land
                    reformers and the lessons of the experience of the other states, led the members of
                    Indiana's convention to engraft an exemption clause into the revised constitution. Since,
                    however, they believed that a constitution should embrace fundamental principles solely and not
                    legislative minutiae, since they held divergent views as to the actual amount of a person's
                    estate that should then be reserved from distraint, and since they felt that the value of property
                    was uncertain and variable necessitating a different amount of exemption at different times so that
                    an exact sum should not be immutably fixed,<hi rend="sup">32</hi> therefore, they incorporated into
                    the new fundamental law only the doctrine that a reasonable portion of property, without specifying
                    the kind of property —whether real of personal, be exempt from execution by statute, and
                    left the details to the legislature.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

            <p>Thus homestead exemption was adopted in Indiana in order to preserve the stability and integrity of

                    society; to protect the community from crime by guarding against debtors becoming paupers and
                    turning to felony from desperation; to foster democracy by increasing the obedience to, and respect

            <p>Next to the Middle Atlantic states, the foreign-born made the largest contribution,

                    14.03%, which gave them third place in the distribution of the population for the county.
                    St. Johns Township proved <pb n="284" id="VAA4025-044-3-062"/> the most popular for the latter group
                    as is evidenced by the fact that 62.67% of the total population of that township came

                    only 2.03%.</p>
            <p>Although some states were represented by a comparatively small number of people, the fact cannot be

            <p>The age distribution also presents an interesting picture in that the older people were natives of a
                    foreign country or some other state outside of the North Central area, and the larger percentage of
                    the younger people were from the North Central states. Over fifteen per cent of the people were
                    above the age of forty. Of the 618 persons in this category, 66.51% were natives of the
                    Middle Atlantic, New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, or Southern states, and 30.26% came from foreign countries. Approximately
                    eighty-five per cent of the inhabitants were below the age of forty. Of the 3,373 individuals in
                    this group, 52.95% were natives of the North Central states, 27.04% came from
                    states outside of the North Central region, and 20.01% emigrated from a foreign country.
                    There were no Hoosiers above the age of forty, but they constituted 34.01% of the
                    population in the division below the age of forty. One can readily see, therefore, that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake County</region>
                    </placeName> in 1850 was <pb n="286" id="VAA4025-044-3-064"/> mostly occupied by young people. The
                    older people, who were probably the first settlers, were largely from states and nations beyond the
                    North Central states, while the younger people were often their children who were born in Indiana
                    and other North Central states. (See Table II.)</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the fact that the young people predominated, the distribution of wealth according to
                    the valuation of the real estate owned indicates that the financial status of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake County</region>
                    </placeName> in 1850 ranked above the average. Over eighty-seven per cent of the opulence was held
                    by people who came from the Middle Atlantic states, New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, and foreign countries. The Middle Atlantic states ranked first with 39.99%,
                    of which <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> contributed 29.95%; foreign countries ranked second with 27.64%,
                    of which 14.16% came from <placeName>

                    </placeName> ranked third with 20.14%. One may conclude, therefore, that since the county
                    was not settled until 1833, those that migrated to this region must have brought fell-filled purses
                    and, no doubt, were also thrifty. The average real estate holding per person for the county was
                    $114.18. Center Township, however, proved to be the wealthiest of the nine townships with
                    an average of $138.99 per person. Solon Robinson,<hi rend="sup">4</hi> the agricultural

            <p>The occupations also varied greatly. Of the 1,102 men fifteen years of age and over who indicated an
                    occupation, 917 were farmers, 34 carpenters, and 19 blacksmiths. Because of the large number engaged
                    in farming, one may assume that they were attracted to this occupation by the opportunity afforded
                    to buy cheap public lands.</p>
            <p>The census records reveal that most of the people made their living by farming, but that many other
                    occupations were followed. They also show that wealth was largely in the hands of the older people
                    who came mostly from outside the state. The age distribution as exhibited by these records, however,
                    indicates that the younger people were to a large extent natives of Indiana. Into this kaleidoscopic
                    picture of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake County</region>
                    </placeName> must be painted the role which education played. In 1850, there were 1,579 children
                    between the ages of five and nineteen, of which, 1,058 or 67.01% attended school. In this
                    connection, it also should be noted that of <pb n="288" id="VAA4025-044-3-066"/> the 1,716
                    inhabitants above the age of twenty only 131 or 7.63% could not read and write in 1850.
                    These percentages are significant because the public school system was not established in Indiana
                    until after the adoption of the constitution of 1851<hi rend="sup">8</hi> and the passage of an act
                    on March 9, 1867, which authorized township trustees, trustees of incorporated towns, and the common
                    council of cities to levy a tax for school purposes.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the early pioneers in education were <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake County</region>
                    </placeName>'s first teacher, Mrs. Harriet Holton of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, who was sixty-eight years of age in 1850, and Mrs. Jane A. H. Ball, also of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, who opened the first boarding school of the county on June 10, 1839. Since other
                    members of the Ball family displayed considerable interest in this phase of the development of the
                    county, the name has been closely associated with education.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

            <p>Regardless of the nativity or age of the early settlers, the real estate owned, or the occupation
                    engaged in, they laid a solid foundation for the structure of the future.</p>
            <p>Since it may be of interest to know who some of the people were who did the spadework, the names of
                    the free inhabitants of Center Township in <placeName>

                    1, 2, and 13 have been omitted. The first column refers to dwelling houses and the second to
                    families, both of which were numbered in the order of visitation. There were 162 dwelling houses and
                    the same number of families out of a total of 715 for the entire county. Column 13 indicates those
                    who were deaf, dumb, blind, insane, idiotic, pauper, or convict. Only one out of a total of fourteen
                    for the county WBS listed under this column. The one inhabitant, a young woman thirty years of age

               <hi rend="i">Abraham Lincoln: His Speeches and Writings.</hi> Edited by Roy P. Basler.

               </placeName>, The World Publishing Company, 1946, pp. xxx, 843. Illustrations,
                    appendix, and index. $3.75.)</head>
            <p>The editor set himself the task of preparing a full and accurate text of Abraham Lincoln's
                    most important works. So well has he accomplished his task that a significant adverse criticism will
                    be hard to support. It is the best text of Abraham Lincoln's manuscripts now available.</p>
            <p>The author (the extensive editorial notes make him more than an editor) employed 247 selections to
                    cover Lincoln's most important works. They range in date from Lincoln's political
                    announcement to the people of "Sangamo County" on March 9, 1832, to his military
                    telegram sent to General Godfrey Weitzel at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, on April
                    12, 1865. Each selection is followed by its editorial notes. Together they occupy 750 pages of text.
                    Frequently the excellent notes far exceed the extent of the Lincoln document. For example, the
                    twelve-line letter to Mrs. Bixby is followed by five and one-half pages of notes. As a matter of
                    fact, the set of notes throughout the volume is the second best contribution of the editor, being
                    surpassed only by the corrected text of the Lincoln writings.</p>
            <p>Other features include a preface by Carl Sandburg and a fifty-two-page essay on
                    "Lincoln's Development as a Writer." This essay by Basler deserves an
                    honorable mention. The value of the book as a first-rate reference volume is further enhanced by a
                    list of the sources of text, a bibliography of the works cited in the notes, and an index. In
                    addition to the frontispiece, there are five well-known photographs of Lincoln from the collection
                    of <geogName>Frederick Hill</geogName> Meserve.</p>
            <p>The volume, which is quarto in size, is beautifully bound in light tan buckram with brown leather
                    labels lettered in gold on the front cover and the back. The endpapers carry a facsimile of the
                    letter written by President Lincoln to Major General Joseph Hooker on January 26, 1863.</p>

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>

            <p>The publication of this new historical journal by the University of Birmingham is a most noteworthy
                    event and should have cultural repercussions both in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. The <hi rend="i">Historical Journal</hi> has been established to provide an outlet for
                    the historical researches of "past and present members of the University," and its
                    first issue is not only a tribute to the editors but also to the historical scholarship of
                    Birmingham. The scope of this annual is not limited to any particular period or aspect of history,
                    but editorial policy requires that one article in each number deal with the local history of the
                    Midlands. The plan of the editors is to publish historical documents from time to time, but new book
                    publications will not be reviewed.</p>
            <p>This first volume more than carries out the intentions of the editors. One article deals with Roman
                    history, one with English medieval history, one with Bohemian history in the days of Hus, another
                    with the history of a Midland municipal corporation during the period of the later Stuarts, one with
                    the population growth of the city of Birmingham between the two World Wars, and last but not least
                    one treats historiographically the imperial problem in North America in the eighteenth century. The
                    selection is varied. The scholarship first class. The tastes of most English and American historians
                    should be gratified.</p>
            <p>Margaret Galway's treatment of the relationship of Joan of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the establishment of the Order of the Garter is an especially fine piece of work.
                    Well-written and ably organized, the article presents an excellent example of the use of internal
                    criticism to scrape away the historical muck that has surrounded the Maid of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It is a story of intrigues, danger, love, and pathos wherein the author concludes that
                    Joan "was more sinned against than sinning" (p. 50).</p>
            <p>The revaluation of Jerome of Prague by R. A. Betts, Masaryk Professor of Central European History at
                    the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>, adds to the historical knowledge of HUS'S great follower. Betts attributes
                    the lack of information on Jerome to the fact that he was a man of action rather than words, but he
                    is of the opinion that Jerome was at least equal to Hus in learning. It is a study that any
                    periodical dealing <pb n="307" id="VAA4025-044-3-085"/> with the history of central Europe would be
                    most happy to publish.</p>
            <p>Local history is apt to have an extremely limited appeal, but Philip Styles has written the history
                    of Bewdley in such a way that it is of interest to all students of English history, especially those
                    who are primarily concerned with the period of the later Stuarts. Bewdley, a town on the Severn,
                    mirrors the national scene. The workings of the Clarendon Code in this borough corporation assumes
                    additional significance because of the association of Richard Baxter with the town. In addition, the
                    reader is given a local study of those religious and political problems which "became
                    canalized into clearly recognizable Whig and Tory parties during the next thirty years" (p.
                    107).</p>
            <p>The most important contribution and the one which will be of most interest to American historians is
                    the analysis by the late Sir Charles Grant Robertson of the imperial problem in North America in the
                    eighteenth century. The years of study which made Robertson one of the more able scholars of the
                    eighteenth century reach their culmination in this historiographical essay. This is indeed a
                    masterful treatment of the revision in interpretation of the American Revolution from George
                    Bancroft to J. C. Miller, wherein Robertson carefully weighs the imperial problem and the changing
                    British and American attitudes towards it.</p>
            <p>Of the American historians who have written on this subject, George L. Beer, Charles H. McIlwain,
                    Herbert L. Osgood, and Charles M. Andrews are considered to be the best with Andrews leading all,
                    "to whose range of learning, scholarship, and sobriety of judgment, adequate justice has
                    not been done in Great Britain" (p. 137). It is too bad, however, that the works of
                    Lawrence H. Gipson were ignored. Of interest to Americans will be the statement: "It must
                    also be confessed that the American contribution in solidity of knowledge and determination to set
                    out the truth impartially is demonstrably superior to the British" (p. 137). Robertson was
                    too modest about his own impartiality and learning, and this bit of historiography should be
                    required reading for all graduate students working in American colonial history or eighteenth
                    century British history.</p>
            <p>The University of Birmingham and the editor-contributor Philip Styles are to be congratulated for the
                    fine beginning <pb n="308" id="VAA4025-044-3-086"/> that they have made with the <hi rend="i">Historical Journal.</hi> Books treating the history of the Midlands might be reviewed.
                    Notwithstanding, historical scholars will undoubtedly await expectantly the next appearance of this
                    well-printed historical annual.</p>

            <p>"Haven't you heard that there are only forty-five states left in the Union? <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName> have gone to Indiana, and Indiana has gone to hell." This little joke, which
                    author Martin incorporates in his volume, is not exactly representative of his work, but it does
                    indicate something of its character. It is not a lovely book. It administers a shock treatment or,
                    like Jove, hurls a bolt of lightning at the people of Indiana. The author strives to awaken Hoosiers
                    to the revolutionary changes which the Industrial Revolution has brought, and to the existence of
                    large masses of relatively uneducated people who are not qualified to decide problems of world
                    importance and who can be whipped into a frenzied racial intolerance. Gone, as characteristics of
                    the state, according to the author, are the neighborliness of the small town, the virtues of pioneer
                    days, the democracy of the common man, in short, the Hoosier tradition. Perhaps, Hoosiers need to be
                    awakened to the industrial character of their state. In this day of postwar reconstruction, they
                    should be reminded of the disgraceful story of intolerance and hate which was written in the state
                    after the previous world war. The critical treatment of local capitalists and labor leaders may also
                    have advantages.</p>
            <p>After the virtues of the shock or of the bolt of lightning are exhausted, the inadequacy of the book
                    becomes very apparent. The author is not Jove. His work is not a "sound"
                    interpretation of Indiana as the publishers claim. Lacking is an evaluation of the good features of
                    the state.</p>
            <p>The author devotes very little space to the period before the Civil War, but enough to reveal that it
                    means little to him and that he should have begun his work in 1860 or later. There is also little
                    relationship of individual chapters to the <pb n="309" id="VAA4025-044-3-087"/> entire work. The
                    attention directed to Court Asher seems unwarranted, since there is no demonstration that he is
                    typical or influential. Is a community to be interpreted by its most eccentric citizen?</p>
            <p>We are not sorry that the book has been written, for it may serve a very useful purpose. It should be
                    read by every Hoosier. As a criticism of Indiana it is significant, but as an interpretation it is
                    inaccurate and inadequate. We are surprised that a reputable publisher like Alfred Knopf should have
                    presented this volume to the public as sound interpretation. We assumed that the company knew
                    Indiana better and held a higher opinion of her people than is here indicated.</p>

                    </placeName> suited to the needs of classroom students and of mature readers generally."
                    Written by Milo M. Quaife, who recently retired from his position as secretary of the Burton
                    Historical Collection, and Sidney Glazer, professor of history in <placeName>

                    </placeName> from earliest times until 1948.</p>
            <p>Quaife, who for many years has been recognized as the leading authority on the Old Northwest, wrote
                    Part I, "Birth of the Commonwealth," which ends with the attainment of statehood
                    in 1837. Using the chronological order in general, he tells the story of the French, the British,
                    and the early American regime.</p>
            <p>There is plenty of color in these pages. The pageant of Sault Ste Marie, the founding of <placeName>

                    exploits of Stevens Thomson Mason, the "Boy Governor," to cite only a few
                    examples, provide the author with interesting materials for his narrative. Part I, however, is more
                    than a story. Quaife has sketched in the background, sometimes in great detail, and he has
                    interpreted events and the actions of men.</p>
            <pb n="310" id="VAA4025-044-3-088"/>
            <p>In Part II of the book, entitled "The Developing Commonwealth," Glazer presents the
                    history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> after 1837 by a combination of the chronological and the topical methods. The first
                    four chapters carry the story through the Civil War, treating of the shift in political allegiance,
                    the antislavery controversy, and the military record of the state. The next five chapters deal
                    respectively with lumbering, minerals, railroads, agriculture, and life in towns and cities.
                    Political events from 1865 to 1916 are discussed in the next two chapters. Then follow a chapter on
                    automobiles and highways, one on the period 1916 to 1932, and others on labor, population and
                    religion, education, and culture. A final chapter covers the years from 1932 to 1948.</p>
            <p>Slightly more than half the book is devoted to the history of the past century. Glazer has included
                    in Part II some discussion of all the significant movements and developments of the period.</p>
            <p>A few errors of fact and of interpretation have been noticed. On page 64, note 6, instead of George
                    Johnson, John Johnston should have been named as the father-in-law of Henry R. Schoolcraft. Father
                    Gabriel Richard served in Congress as delegate from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Territory from 1823 to 1825, not from 1825 to 1829 (p. 145). In view of the fact that
                    the Governor under the Constitution of 1835 appointed the principal officers of the state, his
                    powers, instead of being "more limited than at a later time," were certainly less
                    limited (p. 174). On page 229 occurs the statement that "the presence of the mineral iron
                    was detected through fluctuations of the magnetic compass, an instrument which Burt had perfected to
                    aid him in his surveying labors." The first part of the sentence is true, but it was the
                    solar compass which William A. (not R.) Burt had developed and which was invaluable to him because
                    it was not affected by the iron deposits.</p>
            <p>In addition to the text, the book contains a bibliography at the end of each chapter, a folded map of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> in colors, five historical maps, an appendix listing the governors of the state, and an
                    index. The bibliographies and the maps in particular are useful aids for students and general
                    readers alike.</p>

            <p>Here is history that is delightful and fascinating. The life of the Old National Road is described in
                    a quick pulsating style and illustrated with numerous anecdotes that keep the story close to the
                    earth and the people who used the road. The narrative begins in the days of George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Christopher Gist, and Edward Braddock and extends to the present when large air liners
                    fly above and along the road. The Congressional debates about the constitutionality of federal aid,
                    the route the road followed, and the progress of construction are sketched somewhat briefly, and the
                    account of its extension through Indiana and into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> is thin. The best parts of the book describe the changing life along this famous
                    thoroughfare in the periods marked by new inventions in transportation. Chapters treating the
                    managers of the large coach lines, the coaches and the punishment they inflicted upon their
                    passengers, the freight wagons, the drivers, the inns, post riders, highwaymen and their victims,
                    death and disease, and the folklore of the road are concerned with the years before the railroads.
                    The chapter entitled "Highroad of Death" would be as pertinent to a work on the
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> or to an account of almost any other important road. Briefly
                    told is the story of the Civil War period and of the following years when the railroads took both
                    freight and passenger business. A dramatic revival followed the invention of the automobile and the
                    development of the modern paved highway. This recent period is described in a manner particularly
                    fascinating to people who have used the road. It is also obvious that the author has profited from
                    his own personal experience.</p>
            <p>The vast number of details and generalities are stated accurately, satisfactorily, and at times
                    brilliantly. Only here and there, with considerable intervals in between, errors appear. It is
                    unfortunate that the author was deceived by <pb n="312" id="VAA4025-044-3-090"/> Kate M.
                    Rabb's imaginative <hi rend="i">Tour through Indiana.</hi> We have grown tired of telling
                    students that it was fiction and now Professor Jordan joins the list of those taken in by this
                    account. It is unfortunate that the footnotes are as scarce as in the other volumes of the series.
                    Except in respect to government publications, the bibliography is "suggestive." It
                    has always been a mystery why illustrations cannot be placed nearer the narrative they illustrate.
                    To come upon a picture of a huge modern automobile freight truck in the midst of a chapter on the
                    Civil War is not especially helpful. The author placed the cart before the horse, when he wrote
                    "The great state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>… had brought the road into existence with its Enabling
                    Act…."</p>
            <p>Scattered throughout the book are delightful phrases, humorous stories, jingling rhymes, and
                    interesting incidents. They make history as attractive and stimulating as life itself. The red cover
                    and gold lettering are appealing to the eyes of prospective readers. The book should make it easier
                    for college teachers to persuade students that historical reading can be a pleasure.</p>

            <p>This interesting and well-illustrated volume is not, as its title might suggest, an architectural
                    treatise. It is rather a series of delightful "little journeys" to the homes of

            <p>The writer has been impartial in his coverage of the area. Dividing his territory into the twelve
                    states generally accepted as comprising the Midwest, he includes visits to eight or nine homes in
                    each state except <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>, <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>

            <p>One wonders just what prompted the selections made for one misses many an historic home which he
                    wishes might have been included. On the other hand, one would not wish to miss any found here. The
                    conclusion is that, to do full justice to important places in the Midwest, a whole series of books
                    of this size would be required. As it is, there are included portraits of some eighty-seven houses
                    which have sheltered great, colorful, or historic Midwest figures.</p>

            <p>Paging through a volume like this gives one a sense of intimacy with the figures who dwelt in these

            <p>Lay and professional students of Southern history have <pb n="314" id="VAA4025-044-3-092"/> long been
                    clamoring for an ample synthesis of the recent period. Simkins has met the need in an admirable
                    manner. While he calls his book <hi rend="i">The South Old and New</hi>, the emphasis falls heavily
                    on the new. Beginning with the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Compromise, the author devotes only 162 pages to the period before 1865, while 329
                    pages are given to the years following <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Appomattox</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This distribution of space contrasts markedly with William B. Hesseltine's
                        <hi rend="i">South in American History</hi>, which, beginning with the settlement of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, requires 481 pages to bring the reader to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Appomattox</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and only 180 pages to take him over the remaining period. The tendency of college
                    courses seems to have been toward a weighting of emphasis approximating that of
                    Hesseltine's book. It is to be hoped that Simkins' study will lead to a
                    readjustment in favor of the postbellum phase.</p>
            <p>Simkins has a definite reason for using 1820 as a jumping off point. As he sees it, the vehement
                    attack on slavery elicited by <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>'s application for admission to the Union marked the beginning of the
                    South's awareness of a pronounced cleavage between herself and the rest of the nation.
                    Separateness, based on "common consciousness of kinship" has ever since been
                    endemic in Southern philosophy. A principal ingredient, if not the basic one, in the
                    South's distinctiveness, according to Simkins, is an unrelenting determination to preserve
                    white supremacy. He finds other distinctive qualities in the section's ruralism, religious
                    orthodoxy, and economic conservatism. Not only has the South succeeded in maintaining its chosen way
                    of life within its own boundaries—and this despite changes in externals wrought by war
                    and other influences—but has also, in Simkins' opinion, been able to a
                    considerable extent to convert other parts of the country to its views.</p>
            <p>In sketching the antebellum and Civil War period, the author seems to have leaned somewhat heavily on
                    older general works, and to have neglected recent articles and monographs. As a result, his
                    interpretations sometimes lack the freshness that one might desire. Among conclusions that recent
                    research at least lays open to question are those having to do with the profitableness of slavery,
                    lower class whites being pushed off fertile lands by large planters, immigrants avoiding the South
                    because of its labor standards and climate, and the importance of Northern wheat in preventing
                    English recognition of the Confederacy.</p>
            <pb n="315" id="VAA4025-044-3-093"/>
            <p>In the opinion of this reviewer, the author in spite of an obvious effort to be fair is unduly harsh
                    in his judgment of Abraham Lincoln and overly generous in his evaluation of Jefferson Davis. To say
                    that Davis was a "logical choice" (p. 141) for the Confederate presidency slights
                    the claims of other eligibles, and to say that he was possessed of the "energy"
                    (p. 142) required for his difficult position overlooks his susceptibility to fatigue and dyspepsia.</p>
            <p>But these criticisms apply to a portion of the book that in reality is introductory. In treating the
                    period since the Civil War, Simkins achieves a high degree of accuracy, objectivity, and general
                    excellence. Because of his prior studies of Reconstruction and of the Tillman movement, his
                    development of the postwar period and of political aspects of the newer South is especially
                    praiseworthy. His chapters on education, religion, literature, and the Negro are noteworthy for
                    their informativeness and balance.</p>
            <p>Simkins' work is not that sort of history, revived and defended of late, which consciously
                    abandons objectivity in the interest of promoting pet points of view, and which by so doing builds
                    up reader interest—and hence promotes sales. His is the unglamorous middle-of-the-road
                    course which, while sometimes wearying the reader by scrupulously presenting and weighing both sides
                    of controversial topics, and perhaps disappointing him by failing to draw definite conclusions, has
                    the solid merit of leading him to goals that are sound and tenable.</p>

            <p>The sixteen essays in this compact volume were originally presented at the Writers'

                  <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>,
                            <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
               </placeName>, during the autumn of 1946 under
                    the joint sponsorship of Reed College and the Library Association of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Although written by men and women whose interests range from literature to social
                    work, and embracing subjects that run the gamut of human interests from folklore to race relations,
                    the essays have one thing in common. Their purpose is to explore the extent to which the Northwest
                    has developed a distinctive regional culture.</p>
            <pb n="316" id="VAA4025-044-3-094"/>
            <p>That there should be little agreement on this point is scarcely surprising. One author holds that the
                    area's intellectual patterns parallel those of the rest of the nation, another that the
                    Northwest has slavishly imitated the East, another that rebellion against the region's
                    economic colonial status helps explain its unique thought processes. Nor have the conference
                    participants settled upon—or even defined— the terms
                    "regionalism" and "Northwest." Indeed the one concept finding
                    unanimous support is that any culture worthy of the name must be universal in appeal, even though
                    using regional symbols toward this end. "My concern," writes Joseph B. Harrison,
                    "is not that a writer who works most happily among symbols drawn… from what he
                    knows best and likes most should abandon them; rather it is that he and we should recognize such
                    symbols as the language rather than the fundamental substance of his art."</p>
            <p>Indecisive as the findings of the conference were, they cannot be ignored by historians. Particularly
                    notable in this respect are the portions of the book that deal with the concept of regionalism. One
                    of the most searching essays, that by Joseph K. Howard, holds that "the true concept of
                    regionalism encompasses study of one's neighbors, the physical features of one's
                    environment, and the area's historical tradition, with intent to make a worth-while
                    intellectual contribution to the welfare of the nation or the world." This definition, as
                    R. F. Arragon points out in the best of the discussion papers, means that "regionalism
                    would be valid as a social and cultural concept… only insofar as the regional environment
                    had common meaning for its residents." Intellectual historians should be benefited by this
                    penetrating discussion of cultural (as distinguished from economic or political) regionalism.</p>
            <p>Scarcely less revealing are the portions of the book that reflect the attitude of today's
                    authors toward their native section. Nowhere do the literary great who have contributed to this
                    volume (all of whom sincerely love the Northwest) suggest that anyone writing about any other region
                    becomes a traitor to his homeland, or that a novel about the Northwest is necessarily a good novel,
                    or that authors should be patronized just because they are northwestern writers. The shallow
                    sectional patriotism of the past has apparently been relegated to a well-earned grave. The writer of
                    today, more universal in viewpoint than his ancestors, is willing to recognize <pb n="317" id="VAA4025-044-3-095"/> merit without concern for sectional bias. This enlightened viewpoint
                    portends well for the "one world" of the future.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Northwest Harvest</hi> is ably edited by V. L. O. Chittick, who has skillfully
                    interwoven the comments of critics with the papers presented at the conference. The result is not
                    only an important contribution to the literature of the Northwest but to the nation's
                    cultural history.</p>

            <p>This book is a concise history of the American acquisition or conquest of the Floridas and the Trans-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> West. The first two chapters pertain to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> Purchase and the Floridas, respectively. The ensuing fifteen chapters are devoted
                    almost exclusively to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>. With the exception of one single chapter entitled the "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> Fiasco," the remaining eleven chapters relate to Spanish <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> and the Mexican War. The Gadsden and Alaskan purchases are omitted.</p>
            <p>In his prologue, McCaleb states (and erroneously) that "no historian has essayed to deal
                    with the western movement as a whole." If by this statement, the author means to imply that
                    he has here sought to achieve this goal, then an important omission is the West of the Atlantic
                    seaboard. Moreover, it would appear that his treatment of the Trans-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> West is rather overweighted on the side of the Lone Star State.</p>
            <p>Within the uneven framework of the book, McCaleb has dealt courageously and clearly, but not always
                    impartially, with the subjects under discussion. In the case of the Southwest, he has gone to great
                    pains to show that expansionists believed, as he says, "in enlarging the national domain in
                    the interest of the state," not, as has so often been charged, "in behalf of
                    slavery." Moreover, the author believes that might makes right; that it was as fitting and
                    proper, as it was inevitable, for the Americans to conquer the Southwest at the expense of Mexico;
                    that only through bungling did the <placeName>

                    </placeName> fail to acquire what was rightfully ours— <pb n="318" id="VAA4025-044-3-096"/> the whole of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName>. "And unhappily," he muses (p. 152), "there is no hint in
                    our jumbled world that anything other than might or force will be brought into play to settle the
                    affairs of a tortured world."</p>
            <p>The book is rich in character portrayals, but the narrative—although very interesting and
                    refreshing—is not free from misstatements. For examples, in the chapter on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName>, he uses the term "Hudson Bay" when referring to the important
                    Hudson's Bay Company. He is in error when he states that the data concerning George
                    Vancouver and Alexander McKenzie are "hazy in recital and to some extent lack
                    verification." In referring to the exploits on the <geogName>Columbia River</geogName> of
                    the Americans, Robert Gray, Meriwether Lewis, and William Clark, he completely ignores the equally
                    significant activities of the Britishers, William Broughton and David Thompson. He credits the
                    Spanish with a better title to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> than that of the British, and without qualification credits the Spanish with being the
                    first to "settle <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>

                    hundred scientists who have been designated by their fellow scientists as outstanding were studied
                    by the author in an effort to learn what forces went into the making of a scientist. The work
                    contains preliminary explanations, conclusions, and detailed presentation of the data, in the order
                    named. Numerous tables, charts, and maps present the material visually. A formal bibliography is not
                    included.</p>
            <pb n="319" id="VAA4025-044-3-097"/>
            <p>The work must be read in order to secure an adequate idea of its contents. Since the conclusions
                    require one hundred pages and since much of the material is already reduced to charts and tables a
                    review can be only cursory.</p>
            <p>A number of conclusions are presented that will have special interest beyond the scientists who are
                    more particularly concerned. Large classes and student bodies in higher education are considered
                    unfavorable to the production of scientists. Disparity between the recognition and rewards received
                    by scholars, businessmen, administrators, and entertainers is held to be a cause for a decline in
                    scholarship. Young vigorous university presidents and teachers are more effective in recruiting
                    scientists from the student body. New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, in proportion to population, led in the production of starred men in each of the
                    twelve sciences, but in the number of all starred scientists the East North Central states excelled.
                    The South has not produced so many. Neither topography nor wealth explain the rate of appearance.
                    Cities offer more encouragement than the little towns and the open country, although the difference
                    may be due to isolation and the lack of contacts which lead to opportunities for scientific
                    advancement.</p>
            <p>There are some limitations to the study. There is little consideration given to the idea that
                    scientists like artists may be born not produced. Some men have to sing or paint in order to be
                    happy. Do some others have to live lives of scientific endeavor? How desirable is recruiting of
                    scholars particularly if intrusted to the very young? Two items are emphasized until they suggest a
                    point of view rather than scientific conclusions. They are the lack of adequate rewards and the
                    necessity of young teachers for purposes of attracting promising students. Could we conclude that
                    these professions are sufficiently unremunerative that new scientists must be recruited when they
                    are immature and that the recruiting agents should be only slightly more mature?</p>
            <p>These limitations concern only a few details. Many others are stimulating and original. If the book
                    points the way to the production of more able scholars, it will be widely welcome as a significant
                    book.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Meet the Amish, A Pictorial Study of the Amish People.</hi> By Charles S. Rice and
                    John B. Shenk. (<placeName>

            <p>The Amish, like the American Indians, have had their history and life written largely by those
                    outside their own fold. The result has been much unsympathetic, sensational, and inaccurate writing
                    on the Amish, whether in the form of books, magazine articles, or press releases. The volume under
                    review is a pleasant exception to the general run. In the preface, the authors state that they are
                    natives of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Lancaster County</region>, <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>, that they have lived in or near Amish sections
                    most of their lives, and have genuinely liked their Amish neighbors. This attitude seems evident in
                    the volume. Rice is a printer and photographer and Shenk is a teacher in the Millersburg State
                    Teachers College.</p>
            <p>A mark of accuracy is the correctly understood distinction between the Amish and the Mennonites. The
                    authors point out how the Amish split off from the Mennonites in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> in the latter part of the seventeenth century. One particular question in dispute was
                    the observance of what is called the "ban" or
                    "shunning"—the practice of having no dealings with a brother who is
                    under church discipline. Jacob Ammon, after whom the Amish are named, thought the Swiss Brethren or
                    Mennonites were not strict enough on this point and led his followers out of the parent group.</p>
            <p>The Amish are an extremely conservative people and manifest this in their dress (without buttons) and
                    in restrictions against automobiles, tractors, telephones, and many other modern inventions. Higher
                    education, of course, likewise has no place in their way of life.</p>
            <p>The textual part of the book is brief and free from improtant errors. It is not quite correct to say,
                    however, that the Amish are not allowed "to smoke cigarettes or drink intoxicating
                    liquors." Some, at least, are known to engage in these, especially in smoking. The Amish
                    one "meets" in this book are those in <placeName>

               </placeName>. Failure
                    to point out that there are thousands of Amish in other sections of the country, including a few
                    thousand in Indiana, might be misleading to some readers. The textual part of the book deals with
                    the appearance and apparel of the Amish, their religious development, group characteristics, church
                        <pb n="321" id="VAA4025-044-3-099"/> districts (in <placeName>

                    given, and the influence of these expressions on the English used in these quarters is also shown.</p>
            <p>Most of the book is taken up with excellent photographs of almost every phase of Amish
                    life—their dress, buildings, farms, farm machinery and operations, homes and furnishings,
                    carriages, farm sales, amusements, weddings, schools, barn raisings, etc. Taking these pictures must
                    have required much patience for the Amish are hard to photograph.</p>
            <p>This work is a good corrective to the misleading picture in such works as Ruth Lininger
                    Dobson's <hi rend="i">Straw in the Wind</hi>, and it is a good pictorial supplement to
                    Joseph W. Yoder's accurate account in <hi rend="i">Rosanna of the Amish.</hi>

            <p>In the introduction, the authors acknowledge indebtedness to many who contributed to this book and
                    list them in alphabetical order. There is an index of persons, of places, and sources of
                    information. Some ninety per cent are indexed in another manner, a "pedigree chain or
                    symbol." For example, Lincoln Ellsworth, the noted explorer, is listed as the son of James
                    W. Ellsworth, whose pedigree number is <pb n="322" id="VAA4025-044-3-100"/>
                    "A-1-5-6-2-1-1-3-4." The A means the immigrant ancestor, Thomas Holcombe; each
                    hyhpen represents a generation; the figure 1, underlined, means another name than Holcombe (marriage
                    of a daughter); each figure represents an individual ancestor and shows order of birth of that
                    person; so James W. is eight generations removed from Thomas Holcombe and is descended from the
                    eldest daughter. By shortening from the right one figure at a time, one gets parents, grandparents,
                    etc.</p>
            <p>To find a person, one needs to consult the last index in the book. Several numbers may follow and
                    should be looked up for a complete family record. Names shown in the Contents in the front of the
                    book are people having a large descent or persons of unusual distinction.
                    "In-laws" play an important part in the book, many family histories being
                    included. Also there are pictures of some descendants and views of Holcombe Court in Devonshire, <placeName>
